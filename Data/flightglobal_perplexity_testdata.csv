Recently displayed to military officials at Batajnica airbase, the tactical UAVs can be armed with the FT-8C laser-guided missile, which the defence ministry says has an effective range of up to 3.7nm (6.8km). Serbian defence officials say the nation has acquired ""two complete systems, including six drones"", along with an initial 12 FT-8C weapons. However, they note that work with Chinese counterparts to transfer technology including avionics equipment for integration with Belgrade's developmental Pegaz (""Pegasus"") UAV is ""much more significant than purchase itself"". Two Pegaz prototypes are to be redesigned in China by year-end, and an order for 12 examples is anticipated. Serbian air force chief General Dusko Zarkovic says that an acquisition of six more armed UAVs would be ""optimal"" for the service. Using the type, it plans to re-establish its 353rd reconnaissance squadron, which previously operated versions of the Soko J-22 Orao and Mikoyan MiG-21. Meanwhile, Nenad Miloradovic, assistant minister responsible for defence technologies and procurement says the nation is planning to develop its own platform ""larger than CH-92"", along with a laser-guided missile to arm the type.",8-Jul-20,"Defence, Europe, Military UAVs"

From 2023, the company will supply an undisclosed number of UAVs, which will be employed as part of a so-called ""toolbox” of unmanned systems performing mine countermeasures duties. Also including surface and underwater vehicles and sensors, the equipment will be used by six vessels operated by each of the nations. The V-200's selection by unmanned service provider ECA Group was announced on 8 July, and follows earlier deals to supply the type to the Canadian and German navies for maritime applications. David Willems, UMS Skeldar's vice-president business development and strategy, attributes the V-200's selection to factors including its use of ""the best heavy-fuel engine in the market today”, which has a time between overhaul of 500h. With a payload capacity of 45kg (102lb), the V-200 offers a flight endurance of over 5h. Willems declines to reveal the payload to be carried by the UAV for the Belgian/Dutch requirement, but notes: ""the concept of operations and some of the sensor suite are new for Skeldar”. ""We are going to be providing aerial support for surface and underwater drones,” he says. ""One of the key missions is to provide situational awareness to the ship, and help with communications.” Pointing to the company's previous successes with Canada and Germany, he notes: ""We are now in a leading position with the global NATO navies.” Antony Penn, communication and business development director for ECA Robotics, says the UAV's ""robust and reliable capabilities, and proven track record in the maritime domain” led to its selection. Penn notes that a range of equipment within the unmanned toolbox framework can be ""interchanged, according to the mission and its duration”. The 12-ship mine countermeasures programme for Belgium and the Netherlands is being delivered by Belgian Naval & Robotics and Naval Group, following a selection in 2019. A preliminary design review is scheduled for December, with vessel deliveries to commence in 2024.",8-Jul-20,"Defence, Military UAVs"

The system – known as the BINS-2015 – is intended to replace the foreign-supplied equipment used on serial Superjet aircraft. Irkut, which has absorbed the Sukhoi civil aviation division that manufacturers the type, is conducting the tests as part of a broad programme of import substitution to increase Russian industrial involvement in aviation. Specialist electronics technology company KRET is providing the BINS-2015 which has been fitted to a Superjet prototype aircraft for flight tests. The work is being carried out in connection with the 'SSJ New' programme which will modify the Superjet to produce a 'Russified' version with a greater proportion of domestically-produced systems. Irkut regional aircraft deputy development director Andrei Nedosekin says the inertial navigation system – which uses precision accelerometers and laser gyroscopes – has a capability ""not inferior” to that of its foreign-built competitor. Superjet 100s are currently fitted with the Honeywell Laseref V inertial navigation system. KRET first deputy general director Vladimir Zverev says the Russian developer's equipment is ""currently being tested in the air”.",8-Jul-20,"Aerospace, Aircraft programmes, Europe, Systems & interiors"
3,https://www.flightglobal.com/programmes/iba-highlights-four-engined-widebody-pain-as-airliner-values-decline/139194.article,IBA highlights four-engined widebody pain as airliner values decline,"Aviation consultancy IBA has outlined adjustments to all its commercial airliner market values to reflect the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Older four-engined widebodies and the Boeing 737 Max are among the worst affected, while ""uncertainty” hangs over the Airbus A380. ""Covid has had an undisputed negative effect on all commercial aircraft values, but not all of these will be permanent,” says IBA president Phil Seymour. ""Once airlines have rebalanced their fleets to cater for demand levels in the coming years, the values of certain aircraft will recover, and this is reflected in their relatively small value decline now.” The newest generation narrow- and widebody aircraft have seen the ""mildest adjustments” says IBA, ""as rising costs and environmental legislation lead operators to favour these assets over older aircraft types”. However, the outlook is less rosy for the 737 Max and older widebody types, says the consultancy. ""The Airbus A220 and the A320neo have seen a comparatively low decline in market value of 5-8%, whilst the 737 Max has seen a greater value fall as orders continue to be cancelled following its grounding last year.” Values of four-engined passenger types like the 747-400 have declined by 30-40%, says IBA Four-engined types such as the Airbus A340 and Boeing 747 have seen values declines of up to 30-40%, ""with little hope of recovery as the number of in-service aircraft continues to wind down”. IBA says the A380's future is ""uncertain” as it faces production termination next year and many airlines are opting to retire aircraft early. ""With little secondary market demand, other than for teardown to support existing fleets, its values have declined by up to 34%,” says the consultancy. IBA says that the A320ceo/A321ceo and 737-800 models are the least affected of the current generation narrowbodies, with declines of 9-16%. ""The A319-100 and 737-700 have suffered the greatest negative adjustments due to several fleet exits (A319) and a concentrated fleet (737-700),” it adds. The new-generation Airbus A350 and Boeing 787 widebodies have seen modest declines of 4-13%, says IBA. ""The most resilient variant from a value perspective is the 787-9, which has declined least due to its broad operator base, operational flexibility and medium capacity, which align well with current demand levels.” Declines among older widebody twinjets have varied, with values of certain Boeing 777 variants, ie -200 and -200LR, accelerating a downward trend that started prior to the Covid pandemic. In the regional-jet sector, IBA views the fleets operated extensively in the large US market, such as younger examples Embraer E175s and Bombardier CRJ900s, as being ""relatively insulated”. From a turboprop perspective, IBA believes the ATR family has fared best value-wise, with the ATR42-600 the least affected. ""However, the De Havilland Canada Dash8/Q400 faces a much steeper value decline due to an excess number of available aircraft following airline failures and fleet restructurings,” it says.",8-Jul-20,"Aircraft programmes, Coronavirus, Fleets"
4,https://www.flightglobal.com/airlines/saa-pilots-isolated-as-other-unions-gradually-back-severance-scheme/139193.article,SAA pilots isolated as other unions gradually back severance scheme,"South African Airways unions have largely indicated acceptance of voluntary severance packages as part of the airline's rescue, after the government warned that workers' representatives that it cannot improve on the severance offers. Cockpit union SAAPA has not followed other unions' gradual shift into accepting the proposals, but it appears increasingly isolated and is facing criticism from the government over its stance. The business rescue plan drawn up for SAA has outlined a relaunch strategy that would only have initial places for around 1,000 personnel, on amended terms and conditions. It sets out R2.2 billion ($129 million) in severance funding for workers whose positions will be made redundant if the rescue plan is accepted – a creditor vote is due on 14 July. ""It is important that we ensure that we have an airline that emerges from the business rescue plan that will not be burdened by an unsustainable agreements,” says the government's department of public enterprises. It states that the R2.2 billion budget for severance is ""the best that can be made available” given the ""massive” financial demands and constraints faced by the government. ""[We are] not in a position to accede to any further demands from sections of union leadership for additional benefits,” it adds. Four unions – the NTM, SATAWU, AUSA, and Solidarity – plus non-unionised staff had already signalled a commitment to the severance packages. Three other unions – the pilots' union SAAPA, cabin crew group SACCA, and the NUMSA organisation – had sought to address outstanding concerns over the situation and met with the department on 3 July. The three unions have been particularly resistant to the business rescue scheme and the associated employee retrenchments, which will affect around 2,700 staff. But NUMSA and SACCA have fallen into line with the other unions, leaving just the pilot association SAAPA outstanding. The department of public enterprises says it is ""a concern” that the pilots have embarked on a ""parallel process” through which they intend to consult the business rescue practitioners in an effort to obtain ""unaffordable” concessions. It says a proposal from the pilots aims to generate R290 million in cost savings, compared with the current business rescue plan. But the department has rejected this claim, stating that it believes the restructured SAA will be ""burdened” by the proposal which, it argues, will lead to expenditure that ""far exceeds this purported saving”. This additional cost presents a ""very distinct” risk, it adds, that the new airline will not be financially sustainable, and the department is urging the pilots' association to join the other unions in supporting the severance arrangement. ""[We are] not in a position to accede to any further unreasonable and greedy demands from sections of union leadership for additional benefits,” it adds. Average severance packages for pilots would amount to R1.96 million, and R352,000 for cabin crew. If the business plan is rejected, SAA faces the possibility of liquidation. The department states that ""all stakeholders, particularly employees, stand to lose” in such circumstances.",8-Jul-20,"Africa, Air Transport, South African Airways"

The airline says it has reached new collective agreements with its maintenance and administrative sectors. Chief executive Gonen Usishkin says the arrangement is ""another step on the road to El Al's recovery”. El Al says the maintenance and administration pacts follow a deal in June reached with cabin crew representatives. Some 1,700 jobs will be cut between the three sectors, it states. The cabin crew agreement intends to save $30 million annually through the reduction of regular and temporary flight attendants. El Al employs some 1,400 cabin crew but the Histadrut trade union centre says ""painful concession” are required. Histadrut has also been involved in negotiations with transport workers to achieve the new agreements with maintenance and administrative personnel, collectively around 4,300 employees. The organisation says that, together, the arrangements will save ""tens of millions of dollars” but will mean the workforce in both sectors will be reduced – some through ""favourable” early retirement schemes while others will receive enhanced compensation. ""These agreements represent another significant step in [achieving the strategy] for rescuing the airline,” it says, adding that they demonstrate ""responsible leadership”. Measures such as digital operations will be expanded to help improve efficiency. Histadrut says the agreements will take effect once the airline's secures a rescue package which will include a government-backed loan and the issuing of new shares.

The company tells Cirium it is looking into this ""for operation management reasons”. ""At the present time our aircraft are parked at Hong Kong International Airport, primarily in remote bays, taxiways and other operational areas made available at the airport,” it says. ""We are exploring alternative locations beyond Hong Kong's humid summer climate that can provide appropriate conditions for our aircraft while they are not flying. This is a prudent decision from an asset management perspective.” Cathay did not specify the number of aircraft it is considering parking outside Hong Kong. Reuters, citing an anonymous source, reported on 6 July that Cathay is examining plans to store more than 50 widebodies in drier locations like Dubai and Australia. Cirium has not independently verified that report. Cathay tells Cirium the aircraft being considered for transfer overseas are from ""a number of different fleets” within the group. Its airlines include mainline carrier Cathay Pacific Airways, regional arm Cathay Dragon and budget carrier HK Express.

It notes that the group suffered a full-year net loss of MYR283 million ($66 million) in 2019, a year in which liabilities exceeded assets by MYR1.8 billion. ""In early 2020, the global economy, in particular the commercial airlines industry, faces uncertainty as a result of the unprecedented Covid-19 pandemic,” says Ernst & Young. ""The travel and border restrictions implemented by countries around the world has led to a significant fall in demand for air travel which impacted the Group's financial performance and cash flows. These events or conditions...indicate existence of material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt on the Group's and the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.” The statement accompanied the release of the airline's audited accounts for 2019. After losing money in 2019, AirAsia Group lost MYR953 million in the first quarter, compared with a MYR102 million profit a year earlier. The airline attributed the weakness to the outbreak and weak air travel in February and March as the pandemic intensified. Ernst & Young, however, notes that restrictions on interstate travel and domestic tourism in Southeast Asia provide some relief with improved seat booking and frequencies. It also notes that load factors are ranging between 45-65% in countries where domestic flights have resumed. It adds that the fate of the AirAsia Group depends upon a successful recovery from the pandemic, in addition to a successful outcome of talks with financial institutions and investors. Units AirAsia Philippines and AirAsia Indonesia have also applied for loans. AirAsia Philippines is expected to obtain a government backed loan as part of a local stimulus package. The company is also deferring payment of operating leases, restructuring fuel hedges, and reducing pay. ""The Group is currently in the process of negotiating further waivers or deferrals of lease rentals, and restructuring the remaining fuel hedge exposures with supportive lessors and counterparties,” says Ernst & Young. In the Group's fourth quarter earnings release on 6 July, chief executive Tony Fernandes described the coronavirus crisis as the ""toughest challenge” the airline has faced since it began operations in 2001. He says the group has been restructured into a ""leaner and tighter ship”, reducing cash expenses by at least 50%. He added that the company had received proposals from investment banks and investors in regard to shoring up its capital and liquidity.

The 27 cancellations, disclosed by Avolon in a 7 July second quarter business update, add to 75 Max cancellations that the Dublin-based lessor announced in April. Avolon has now nixed a total of 102 Max orders. Including the latest cancellations, Avolon still holds orders for 37 737 Max, according to Boeing. That figure is 18 fewer than the 55 Max orders Avolon held after the April cancellations. The figures suggest nine of the 27 cancellations were for aircraft Avolon had intended to purchase from third parties, possibly through sale-leaseback deals with airlines. Avolon, however, did not respond to a request for more information. ""In light of the Covid-19 pandemic, we continue to work with our customers to balance supply and demand with market realities, especially in the leasing sector,” Boeing says in response to Avolon's latest cancellations.

Year to date, Boeing's customers have cancelled roughly 450 Max orders, according to disclosures and Boeing data. But Boeing has been making progress with the Max's certification. Last week, the FAA completed three days of Max certification flights during which pilots and engineers evaluated Boeing's proposed changes to the aircraft's troubled automatic flight control system called the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation Systems (MCAS). Investigators implicated that system as a factor contributing to two crashes that killed 346 people and spurred the grounding, which has been in place since March 2019.

14,https://www.flightglobal.com/strategy/united-sees-cancellations-rise-warns-of-furloughs/139182.article,"United sees cancellations rise, warns employees of furloughs","United Airlines says cancellations of forward bookings are once again rising due to new travel restrictions and increasing numbers of coronavirus cases across the southern Sun Belt states, prompting a warning that furloughs will be inevitable. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission based on a management town hall meeting on 6 July, the Chicago-based carrier says the seven-day average of cancellations of bookings to and from Newark Liberty International airport within 30 days of departure increased to 85% on 1 July from 65% just two weeks earlier. Newark, one of three major New York City metropolitan area airports, is one of United's busiest east-coast hubs. For all other airports, the cancellations increased to 73% from 70%. The cancellations come as governors of the three states around New York City – New York, Connecticut and New Jersey, also known as the tri-state area – on 24 June began requiring inbound passengers from numerous other US states to isolate for 14 days after arrival. Initially, the restrictions applied to travellers from just eight states. But over the past two weeks the tri-states' governors raised that number to 22, meaning inbound travellers from almost half of US states – including those with rapidly rising case counts like Texas, California, Florida and Arizona – will be required to quarantine upon arrival in the New York City metropolitan area. The New York City region experienced a peak in infections in April, and officials have been trying to prevent a second wave. In addition to increasing cancellations, United's filing says it told employees it ""does not expect the recovery from Covid-19 to follow a linear path”, and is preparing for involuntary furloughs beginning in the fourth quarter. United says it anticipates August capacity to be 65% lower than the same month a year ago, ""which includes certain adjustments that the company plans to make to the schedule previously announced on July 1, 2020, resulting from reduced demand to destinations experiencing increases in Covid-19 cases and/or new quarantine requirements or other restrictions on travel”. Just last week, on 1 July, United announced an additional nearly 25,000 new and reinstated flights during the month of August, tripling its schedule size from June. That optimistic tone has now been effectively shelved. ""The company plans to continue to proactively evaluate and cancel flights on a rolling 60-day basis until it sees signs of a recovery in demand, and expects demand to remain suppressed until a widely accepted treatment and/or vaccine for Covid-19 is available,” the company writes in the filing. In addition, United says it will begin informing employees of potential furloughs between now and the middle of the month. The federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act requires employers to give 60-day written notice to employees in most cases where mass layoffs will occur. As a condition for taking government financial aid from the CARES Act earlier this year, airlines had to refrain from involuntary layoffs until at least 30 September. With that deadline fast approaching, carriers are now beginning to make contingency plans for the case in which demand does not return to pre-coronavirus levels. Industry analysts have said they expect it to take about three years for the sector to return to 2019 business. To limit daily cash burn, many airlines have introduced generous voluntary leave and early retirement programmes in the hope that these would encourage employees to step away from their jobs. But early signals show that even with the voluntary schemes, airlines' current employee counts far exceed their needs. Pilot and flight attendant unions have already called on the US government to extend furlough protections and expand the financial support programme for airlines, so far to little success.",8-Jul-20,"Airlines, Coronavirus, Must Read, North America, Strategy, United Airlines"

The Montreal-based carrier, which has been operating charter and speciality flights across Canada's far north for almost three decades, says on 7 July that it is looking to take a slice of the holiday travel market from Canada's established market leaders. The airline says it has been ""secretly working since 2018 to create a new airline that will position them in the tourist flight market”. It has invested ""more than $1 million in a think tank to reinvent the way things are done in this industry”. The result is an airline called OWG, which stands for ""off we go”. ""The flight portion of your trip should be an integral part of your vacation,” says Marco Prud'homme, president of the new airline. ""Traditional airlines have chosen to cut the quality of their services year after year with no regard for the passenger experience. Our goal is to win the hearts of Quebecers with a new airline whose mission is to get travellers excited again.” Nolinor says it acquired several Boeing 737-400s with 158 seats earlier this year for OWG, and on 6 July received permission from the government of Canada to launch international service. On its website, a countdown clock indicates the launch will be on or near 31 August. The airline has not revealed routes or frequencies. It only says it will be flying to ""tropical destinations”. The timing of the launch is curious, as most major airlines across North America have had to cut networks, store aircraft and lay off staff after passenger demand dropped sharply as a result of lockdowns and shelter-in-place orders designed to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Most major carriers have had to access government aid to manage through the resulting liquidity squeeze. Canadian holiday specialists Air Transat and Sunwing Airlines halted operations in April and expect to resume flights and tour operator activities at the end of July. Calgary-based WestJet, which also has a strong leisure-traveller business to southern destinations, said last month that it was eliminating more than 3,000 jobs due to the crisis, leaving less than 5,000 employees out of a pre-coronavirus workforce of 14,000. In the US, the launch of David Neeleman's Breeze, a new carrier that aims to connect secondary markets, has been delayed to 2021 due to uncertainty around the bounce-back of passenger demand following the coronavirus pandemic.",8-Jul-20,"Airlines, Coronavirus, North America, Strategy"

The Mexico City-based carrier, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings in a US court on 30 June, says it is looking to be released from leases of 19 aircraft, including ten Boeing 737s and nine Embraer 170s. Five of the Boeings and the E170s would exit the fleet on 1 July, the rest on 15 July. That would leave Aeromexico with 34 737s and none of the smaller Embraer regional jets in its fleet, according to fleets data from Cirium. Aeromexico Connect, the airline's regional subsidiary, still has 47 Embraer E190 jets in its fleet. Aeromexico is looking to streamline its fleet by cutting 737NG and Embraer 170 aircraft. It will continue to operate the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. ""In consultation with their advisors, the debtors have determined that the excess leased equipment is not necessary for the debtors' continued operation or successful reorganisation, and the debtors seek to eliminate rental, insurance, storage and other costs,” the airline writes in a filing dated 3 July. Pre-coronavirus, the airline also operated 19 787 Dreamliners and had six 737 Max, according to Cirium fleets data. The Max remains grounded after two accidents killed 346 people. In the filing documents, the airline says it also hopes to return four General Electric CF34-8E5 engines, which power E170s As of 30 June, the date upon which the company filed for bankruptcy protection, the airline says it had a fleet of 126 aircraft, of which it owned 25. The other 101 were leased – 96 under standard leases and five with purchase options. The company says it paid $36 million dollars each month in rent for aircraft under these 101 leases. The airline adds that it is being fiscally responsible in streamlining its fleet and reducing the number of different types it operates and will reduce costs for training, spare parts and maintenance. Aeromexico's first court date in its bankruptcy proceedings is scheduled for 20 July. Aeromexico filed for bankruptcy just 11 days after it had said it would not, stating at that time that it had been ""evaluating alternatives to move towards a better financial position”. It became the third Latin American carrier to seek protection from creditors after the coronavirus pandemic and the ensuing sharp drop-off in passenger demand decimated the air transport industry earlier this year. Chile's LATAM Airlines and Colombia's Avianca filed for bankruptcy in May after liquidity crises forced them to restructure debt. Latin American governments have been slow to support their aviation industries, and have provided only meagre financial aid to airlines.",8-Jul-20,"Aeromexico, Airlines, Coronavirus, Latin America, Strategy"

Speaking during a webinar organised by the World Aviation Festival on 7 July, Volaris chief executive Enrique Beltranena said that the carrier's costs ""are absolutely variable” and that it is operating with ""the same number employees as when [the coronavirus crisis] started”. Retaining the workforce has been possible, he explains, because staff are employed on flexible payment terms. That is among reasons why the carrier has ""barely burned” any of the $450 million (€398 million) in cash that it had going into April and May, when its operations were largely grounded. ""We have been able to reallocate a lot of the fixed expenses of the company and renegotiate deferrals and haircuts in a lot of cases,” Beltranena says. ""As a result, we are preserving our cash in a very effective way.” He clarifies that reports the carrier is looking to private markets for funding are ""not really” true, despite Mexico's government ruling out state aid for the airline sector. Volaris might, however, seek external cash should it target speedier expansion than currently envisaged, he says. Amid that lack of state support, the outlook is not so positive for other carriers in Mexico, Beltranena believes. He expects that ""in matter of 24 months [the market] will recover its demand at regional levels but maybe with one or two carriers less”. Among Mexico's airlines, flag carrier Aeromexico recently filed for bankruptcy protection, while low-cost rival Interjet has been under severe financial pressure. For all of Mexico's carriers, Beltranena reckons demand will be 65-68% of 2019 levels by the end of 2020, rising to 85-88% by the end of 2021, then reaching parity by the end of 2022. Volaris has an advantage amid that recovery because it focuses on visiting friends and relatives traffic, he says, where demand has been returning more quickly compared with the corporate sector. As a result, Volaris' share of the Mexican market has risen as flights ramp up, from around 30% pre-March to 40% in July, Beltranena claims. Much of the airline's strategic focus is still on convincing people to switch from bus travel to Volaris' domestic flights, he continues, adding that enhanced pandemic-related health procedures on aircraft versus buses might tempt more people to change modes of transport. But despite Beltranena's confidence in Volaris's financial security, the carrier is still reining in fleet expansion plans, including through deferrals of incoming Airbus A320neo aircraft. The airline has agreed to keep its all-leased fleet ""at the lowest level” in the near term, Beltranena states, adding that it would go to the secondary market ""if necessary”, should demand differ from current assumptions. Cirium fleets data shows Volaris has 63 A320neos on order, plus 43 A321neos. The carrier in June announced it was deferring eight of the 18 deliveries it had expected to take through to the end of 2021. Baltenena says the airline will still ""probably take delivery” of five A320neos that were due to arrive earlier this year, and is therefore likely to end 2020 with around 88 aircraft. From 2021, ""we will be taking deliveries of the A320neos, but we'll be getting rid of A320ceos, so we can really take advantage of the reduction of the fuel burn”. That reduced fuel burn is an important differentiator for an ultra-low-cost carrier's unit costs, despite low fuel prices, Beltranena says. ""With deliveries to 2023, it's going to stay pretty much the same, at 86-88 aircraft every year,” he adds regarding Volaris' near-term fleet size. Volaris' network covers domestic services in Mexico, plus routes to the USA and Central America.

Blue Air says it has taken the protective measure of 'concordant procedure' - a preventative action under which companies seek to reach agreement with creditors. Blue Air has had its settlement procedure accepted by a court, allowing a staggering of debt payments while the airline's resumption of flights – in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis – will start to generate the revenues necessary to meet its obligations. The carrier says it has lost some €100 million in revenues over the course of March-June, as a result of the four-month disruption to its services. ”Despite the temporary difficulties caused by the suspension of flights due to the Covid-19 pandemic, we, at Blue Air, are determined to continue flying, to honour all our commitments and to pay all our debts.” says Blue Air chief executive Oana Petrescu. It will be assisted by a specialist division of financial firm KPMG which will act as a restructuring consultant. The airline says that direct losses caused by the pandemic will be covered by the state aid approved by the Romanian Government in April, and debts to suppliers will be paid in instalments, ”according to the schedule to be agreed in the concordat procedure”. Blue Air last month began restoring flights following the coronavirus grounding. Following the lifting of restrictions in Belgium, Italy, Spain and the UK, the airline is from today operating to ""most of its traditional” destinations, comprising around 250 flights a week. Blue Air is operating 20 international routes from Bucharest, six international routes from both Bacau and Iasi.

The operation is a stepping stone for ambitious plan to create a ""micro-airline” using a fleet of small, sustainable aircraft to serve towns and cities throughout the UK and northern Europe using a network of under-utilised aerodromes. ""We are keeping a close eye of all the zero-emission aircraft programmes under development which could potentially be added to our fleet,” says Neboair founder and chief executive Sergey Grachev. So far, the Velis Electro is the only all-electric aircraft to be be certificated anywhere, following European Union Aviation Safety Agency approval for the two-seat type on 10 June. Its 76hp (58kW) liquid-cooled electric engine and three-bladed, fixed-pitch composite propeller delivers a cruise speed of 90kt (170km/h), and an endurance of up to 1h. Neboair currently has two Velis Electros on order, with the first scheduled to arrive in September and enter service the following month. The second example will be added in March next year,”with a fleet of 10 Electros planned by the end of 2023”, Grachev says. The launch service will connect Damyns Hall aerodrome near London with Neboair's headquarters at Shipmeadow airfield, near Norwich. This private strip is located on the site of Neboair's sister company and high-end country retreat Yoga Park. Neboair is also adding a third base at Wickenby airfield near Lincoln, around 1h northwest of Shipmeadow. ""Our aim with these Electros is to provide a rural tourism service and experience flights, and to train future pilots to fly fully-electric aircraft,” says Grachev. The service will initially be offered under a private ride-sharing arrangement, with each traveller sharing the direct operating costs of each flight. ""Our aim is to build up interest in the concept of an emission-free air service before we go down the path of applying for an expensive AOC [air operator certificate], and launching a commercial operation,” says Grachev. He is in no doubt that sustainable air travel ""is the future”, and commuters will ""embrace the concept of short-haul, zero-free, low-cost, low-noise, fast and efficient transport”. There is a potential to connect to around 100 licenced aerodromes in the UK, and even more in northern Europe, Grachev adds. ""First we have to put the infrastructure in place at these sites to serve this new generation of aircraft,” he says. Neboair is now in the process of installing fast-charging points for the Velis Electros in Damyns Hall, Shipmeadow, Wickenby, and at a couple of aerodromes in-between to allow for re-charging en-route.",8-Jul-20,Business & General Aviation

The Kenyan government says domestic flights will be allowed to resume on 15 July and international services on 1 August.  Its move to reopen comes after the Nairobi Securities Exchange on 3 July suspended trading in Kenya Airways shares for three months while the government debates whether to nationalise the airline. The National Aviation Management Bill 2020, published in mid-June, proposes folding the airline into a state-owned aviation holding company. Kenya Airways could not immediately be reached for comment. The SkyTeam carrier's pre-tax losses deepened to KSh13 billion ($122 million) for the year ended December 2019. African countries are beginning to reopen their borders after many shut down air travel in March to curb the spread of Covid-19. However, the World Health Organization has warned of the delicate balance between resuming international flights to help economies recover and avoiding a surge in coronavirus infections. ""Air travel is vital to the economic health of countries,” states the WHO's regional director for Africa, Dr Matshidiso Moeti. ""But as we take to the skies again, we cannot let our guard down. Our new normal still requires stringent measures to stem the spread of Covid-19.” So far, Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, Tanzania and Zambia have resumed commercial flights, according to the WHO. The 15 members of the Economic Community of West African states are expected to open their airspace on 21 July, it adds. Rwanda has announced that it will reopen to scheduled international flights on 1 August. ""Many African countries acted swiftly, implementing confinement and travel restrictions in the early days of the pandemic,” says the WHO, noting that 36 African nations closed their borders to international travel, eight suspended flights from countries with high Covid-19 transmission, and others ""had partial or no restrictions”. African airlines stand to lose $6 billion of passenger revenue this year, compared with 2019, and aviation job losses could total 3.1 million, IATA has forecast.

Chief executive Vitaly Saveliev has outlined the ambition during a meeting with Russian president Vladimir Putin. Saveliev pointed out that the company was experiencing problems with bringing its domestic services back to normal even with heavily-discounted fares. Aeroflot Group's low-cost division Pobeda has been offering tickets at prices cut by 60%. ""When passengers buy tickets, its aircraft look as if they are almost full. But then, before departure, their seats are only 80% occupied,” Saveliev told Putin. ""This is because many passengers are refusing to fly, because the cities to which they are going still have restrictions in place, which scare passengers – and they don't fly.” Putin assured that almost all regional governors had submitted plans on a phased lifting of restrictions – pointing out that this was because the coronavirus situation was improving, and not because the air transport industry was ""having a hard time”. ""This is very important because, as soon as we do this, the situation will change radically,” Saveliev told him. He added that, if flights are allowed to recover, domestic operations could be fully restored to last year's level by December. Saveliev said that several European and Middle Eastern carriers were resuming international services, and that Aeroflot could restore about 80% of its own operation by the end of the year, with a full level returning by the end of March. He added that Aeroflot was keen to recover its transit traffic, particularly between China and Europe, where it occupied a strong position.

Among a series of resolutions approved by the company's board, a maximum of 80 new aircraft will be added to the group's fleet through to 2023 – around half the number planned pre-coronavirus. It does not specify which incoming aircraft will be targeted, but Cirium fleets data shows Lufthansa Group has almost 200 aircraft on order. Lufthansa mainline's outstanding orders comprise 61 Airbus A320neos, 35 A321neos, 27 A350-900s, 20 Boeing 777-9s and 20 787-9s.

Further measures announced today include the cutting of 1,000 administration positions from the group's German mainline operation, while leadership positions will be reduced by 20% across the group. At the same time, the number of board members will be reduced by one at each of its cargo, training and catering units. Even with the crisis abating, Lufthansa Group claims its has a ""personnel surplus of at least 22,000 full-time positions” and calls on unions and other bodies representing employees to agree on ""crisis-related measures” to avoid layoffs ""wherever possible”. ""So far, negotiations have only been successful with the UFO cabin union,” the group states. Other new measures include the expedition of splitting off the mainline Lufthansa operation into a separate corporate entity. Explaining the reason for this new round of measures, Lufthansa describes the group's financing as ""currently secure”, but nevertheless notes that an ""additional burden” will be placed on the business in coming years as it repays the government loans and investments that have stabilised it during the pandemic. For this reason, alongside the fall in demand for air travel, ”sustainable cost reductions” are inevitable, it states. Lufthansa Group is aiming to pay off those government loans and additional investments ""as possible to avoid a further increase in interest charges”, it adds. The group's first set of measures, announced in April, included the reduction of its fleet by 100 aircraft an end to operations by its Germanwings unit.

Deloitte announced on 26 June that Bain Capital won the bid and entered into a sale and implementation deed, one that is ""subject to minimal conditions precedent such as regulatory approvals”, having received approval by the Australian Treasurer pursuant to the Australian Foreign Investment Review laws. In the same announcement, Deloitte indicated that it received, among others, an alternative proposal ""from the representatives of an ad hoc group of bondholders of the Virgin Australia Group” on 24 June. Broad Peak was among a group of bondholders owed around A$2 billion ($1.4 billion), which proposed to Deloitte a debt-to-equity swap plus a fresh capital injection of around A$1 billion into Virgin Australia, according to a 24 June Reuters report.

Assessment of certain discs in service has revealed that rubbing contact with interstage static seals can lead to cracks in the front seal fins – which, in turn, could lead to cracks in the disc. As an interim measure, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency is preparing to mandate an inspection of seal fins on the third- and fourth-stage discs – with specific part numbers – in the low-pressure turbine. The one-time ultra-high sensitivity fluorescent penetrant inspections should take place at the next engine refurbishment shop visit, according to a proposed EASA directive. If any cracking is indicated on the seal fins, the disc parts must be replaced. EASA warns that the condition could lead to propagation of cracking, possible low-pressure turbine disc failure, and expulsion of high-energy debris.

The Italian airframer – developer of the P180 Avanti twin-pusher and its unmanned surveillance variant, the P1HH Hammerhead – entered extraordinary receivership in December 2018 after Abu Dhabi wealth fund Mubadala, its sole shareholder, pulled out. Bidding for the company ran from 26 February until 29 May. Extraordinary commissioner Vincenzo Nicastro says offers ""have arrived from all over the world”, including companies in Canada, China, France, Germany, Italy and the USA. However, he declines to reveal their identities due to confidentiality agreements. The ""vast majority” of the bidders are interested in acquiring the whole company – which is Nicastro’s preferred outcome. ""Those parties who are interested only in one of the two businesses - aircraft manufacturing and development, or engine support - have indicated that they are ready to reconsider the possibility of acquiring it in full, once due diligence is completed,” he says. This process is expected to end on 31 August, when parties will be invited to submit binding offers. ”Our aim is to select a buyer before the end of the year, and complete the sale in the first half of 2021,” says Nicastro. He describes the ideal owner for Piaggio as ""a solid company” with a long-term strategy for the firm. ""It must be ready to develop Piaggio’s existing portfolio, invest in its future and its skilled workforce, and of course, pay the right price.” He does not expect the worsening global economic climate, triggered by the coronavirus pandemic, to have ""much of an impact” on the acquisition price or sale process. ""Even if some interested parties have been discouraged by the pandemic, receiving 19 expressions of interest in Piaggio confirms that there is a huge interest in the company,” he says. Piaggio’s appeal to a potential buyer is sweetened by a lifeline package of orders and commitments secured by Nicastro from the Italian government, worth around €900 million ($980 million). This includes a deal for nine new Avanti Evos, and the retrofit of 19 earlier-generation examples of the twin-engined turboprop operated by the country’s armed forces.

The aircraft (ET-AUP), which was preparing for departure to Stockholm and Addis Ababa on 18 December 2018, had been given the wrong stand number, even though two de-icing co-ordinators had agreed on the correct stand allocation. Investigators state that the Ethiopian 787 was part of a queue for de-icing. It was followed by a Lufthansa Airbus A320 an Atlas Air Boeing 747. Gardermoen's 'B-North' de-icing platform comprised nine parking stands, in three groups of three, of which only the centre stand of each group – those numbered 992, 995 and 998 – was suitable for large aircraft. The two co-ordinators thought the most practical option was to allow the larger 787 and 747 to taxi respectively to stands 992 and 995, ahead of the A320. This meant re-organising the aircraft queue. The inquiry believes this reshuffle became the ""main focus” of one of the co-ordinators and ""may have contributed” to his subsequent ""slip-up” when he instructed the 787 to use stand 991 instead of 992. Stand 991 was too narrow to accommodate the 787's wingspan. But there was no information in the Norwegian aeronautical information public, or NOTAMs, about which aircraft types could use which de-icing stands, and no signage to warn aircraft crews. Although the 787 captain saw the lighting mast as the jet taxied slowly onto the stand, and thought the clearance was marginal, he was confident about the instructions he had been given. He asked the first officer whether he could see the distance between the wing-tip and the mast. The first officer, however, had a limited view. As the 787 edged forward, the driver of as SAS Ground Handling de-icing vehicle parked at the front edge of stand 991 realised the aircraft was too large. But the vehicle was an older model and did not have a VHF radio to warn the 787 crew directly, so the driver had to resort to calling the de-icing co-ordinators over an internal radio. One of the co-ordinators, about 8s before the collision, tried relaying a message to stop the 787 but the jet struck the mast, badly damaging its right wing and causing the mast to collapse. Accident Investigation Board Norway is recommending the AIP is reviewed to state aircraft limitations for de-icing stands, and that technical solutions are found for Gardermoen to prevent aircraft being directed to the wrong stand. It is also recommending that European regulators consider requirements to fit large aircraft with anti-collision aids for taxiing.",4-Jul-20,"Air Transport, Airlines, Ethiopian Airlines, Europe, Ops & safety"

The airline had been operating a limited number of passenger and cargo services from Israel, although its scheduled passenger flights had been suspended until 31 July.

The Air Astana aircraft had emerged from maintenance at Portuguese firm OGMA during which the aileron cables were inadvertently reconnected the wrong way around, effectively reversing the roll control. After the aircraft departed from Alverca do Ribatejo air base on 11 November 2018, to be ferried back to Almaty, the pilots experienced severe control problems – at one point considering a sea ditching before they managed to regain sufficient control to land at Beja nearly 2h after take-off. While Portuguese investigation authority GPIAAF has primarily attributed the serious incident to the maintenance blunder, it has also noted that the final line of defence – the crew's pre-flight check – did not catch the problem. Embraer's cockpit instruments include a multi-function display screen which features a synoptic page. This contains a diagram of the aircraft – as it would appear from behind, looking forwards along the fuselage axis – and graphic depictions of the flight-control surfaces, including the ailerons, rudder, elevators and spoilers. When the control yoke is manipulated, the corresponding control-surface graphics respond on the screen. The pilots use the synoptic page during the after-start checks to ensure the control surfaces are responding correctly to the yoke movements. As the yoke is turned, green graphic representations of the surfaces, showing their direction of deflection, appear on the diagram. Surfaces failing to deploy are shown as orange graphics. Air Astana's standard operating procedures, based on Embraer's recommendations, required the left-hand pilot to select the synoptic display before carrying out a check for smooth and continuous movement of control surfaces, from neutral to full deflection each way. Turning the yoke to the left would normally deflect the left-hand aileron upwards and the right-hand aileron downwards. But the inquiry says the standard procedure ""lacked detail”, specifically regarding the direction of the controls, which ""did not allow” the crew of the affected aircraft to detect the misconfigured ailerons. While the procedure had ""weaknesses”, the inquiry also points out that the mandatory control check is a frequent and ""highly routine” exercise, carried out before each flight. Given that any system failure or misconfiguration is unlikely, it states, pilots can ""easily” miss interpreting whether the aileron surfaces are deflecting in the correct direction. No details on the crew's pre-flight check, from the cockpit-voice or flight-data recorders, have been disclosed by the investigation. Although the heavy maintenance had involved substantial adjustment to aileron mechanisms, the crew of the aircraft was ""not generally aware” of the scope of the work or the systems disturbed, the inquiry says. Nor had Air Astana provided guidance to its crews on accepting an aircraft which had just undergone particular maintenance procedures – a measure not legally required but nevertheless considered 'best practice'. Air Astana insists that the ""root and primary cause” of the incident was ""systemic organisational and procedural failures” at OGMA, which led to the ""near-fatal mistake” of incorrect aileron cable installation. But it concedes, in comments to the inquiry, that ""an opportunity to detect” the misconfiguration ""was missed” by the crew during the after-start checks. In the aftermath of the incident, says the inquiry, the airline has reinforced the ""visualisation and interpretation” of the control surface positions during pre-flight checks, to focus more attention on their response to yoke commands. The procedure includes a call-out by the left-seat pilot. Air Astana has also modified crew briefings to cover non-revenue flights after maintenance work, and introduced an aircraft acceptance checklist for pilots – including details of systems affected – for use after significant maintenance intervention. Investigators have pointed out that the maintenance personnel could have used the synoptic page display, as well as observation of the ailerons' physical deflection, to check the correct installation of the aileron cables before the aircraft was released from service.",4-Jul-20,"Air Astana, Air Transport, Airlines, Asia Pacific, Europe, MRO, Ops & safety"

But the opposition Democratic Alliance believes the country's treasury, which is having to cope with funding pressures from the coronavirus crisis, is reluctant to continue bailing out the troubled airline as part of any rescue. The government's department of public enterprises has been backing a rescue plan on which creditors are set to vote on 14 July. Liquidation, it says, would be ""protracted and costly” and will ""lead to financial hardship” for employees as well as a ""substantial undervaluation” of the airline's assets. ""All SAA stakeholders...should realise that business rescue provides a better outcome than liquidation and should be supported for their collective interests,” it adds. The department argues that a rescue is a ""viable alternative” which supports job preservation and can ""bring the airline back from the brink”. ""Transformation of SAA into a competitive airline will unfortunately require sacrifices and a major restructuring, starting on a conservative basis and gradually and systematically building up over the next three years,” it says. But the treasury outlined South Africa's financial pressures during a joint meeting, on 3 July, between the parliamentary standing and select committees on finance. ""Higher government spending and borrowing has not led to higher growth in many years,” it stated. ""We should not confuse people's desire to lend us money with our ability to pay it back.” The treasury added that it considered the government has a choice between a ""looming debt spiral or fundamental reform - and no other option exists”. South Africa's political opposition, the Democratic Alliance, is accusing the department of public enterprises of misleading the public into believing that funds for SAA's rescue have been budgeted, stating that an emergency budget last month ""did not make any provision” for SAA funding. It says the rescue plan requires R33 billion in funding for three years but offers ""no guarantee”, despite projections, that the rescued airline - which the party is describing as a ""dead duck vanity project” - will become profitable in its fourth year.",3-Jul-20,"Africa, Air Transport, South African Airways"

Flown by test pilot Sean VanHatten, the milestone sortie lasted 22min starting with a full-power take-off and climb to 13,500ft. ""A series of manoeuvres were then conducted to evaluate handling characteristics,” says Stratos. ""The first flight of the 716X went as briefed, which is a testament to the design quality and the professionalism of the crew here at Stratos,” says VanHatten. ""The aircraft is well harmonised, and its directional stability was very good,” he adds. Startos says the sortie is the first of ""an extensive flight-test programme that will span the next several months”. Launched in 2018, the carbonfibre, single-engined 716 programme is a longer and wider version of the 714, which it replaces. The 716X is the kit-built version of the six-seat aircraft, which Stratos chose to bring to market ahead of the US Federal Aviation Administration FAR Part 23-certificated model. This is to allow the company to refine the product, lower development costs for the 716, and help attract investors who will assist in bringing this version to market. While structurally both aircraft are identical, the 716X is powered by the same 2,900lb (12.9kN)-thrust Pratt & Whitney Canada JT15D-5 engine as the 714 and features a Garmin G3X flightdeck. The certificated variant will use a 3,400lb-thrust PW535E, and feature either G3000 or G5000 avionics. ""When we introduced the proof-of-concept 714 three years ago, the marketplace interest was tremendous,” says Stratos chief techinical officer, Carsten Sundin. ""It was clear that the market is looking for the performance and comfort we were offering, but in a true six-place aircraft. We have achieved this with the 716X. With a cabin width of 4ft [1.2m] and height of 4.8ft, there is plenty of room for passengers to relax on long flights.” Stratos says it has ""invested significantly” to support the production of the 716 and 716X. Its Redmond facility totals over 3,800sq m (41,000sq ft) and ""boasts a full engineering team, design office, assembly facility, and a manufacturing machine shop complete with a gantry router, large volume 3D printer, waterjet cutter, and CNC machines,” it says.

The devolved administrations of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will take their own decisions on whether to relax quarantine restrictions for international arrivals into their airports. France, Germany, Italy and Spain are included on the list of countries that will be exempt from the restrictions, the UK Department for Transport says. The government plans to publish the full list of countries later on 3 July. Arrivals from the USA will still be required to self-isolate for 14 days upon entering the UK, transport secretary Grant Shapps said during an interview with BBC Radio 4. Asked whether the USA would be on the ""red” list of countries that are not exempt from quarantine restrictions, Shapps said: ""I'm afraid it will be. The US from a very early stage banned flights from the UK. There isn't a reciprocal arrangement in any case there.” The UK Foreign & Commonwealth will drop its advice to avoid non-essential travel to the countries that qualify for exemption from 4 July. ""The government's expectation is that a number of the exempted countries will also not require arrivals from the UK to self-isolate,” says the DfT. There is no guarantee that the exemption from quarantine will be reciprocal, however. The UK government introduced its mandatory 14-day quarantine for most passengers arriving in the country on 8 June, promising a review three weeks later.

The Sydney Seaplanes aircraft, with six occupants, had departed Cottage Point, initially heading north-east along Cowan Creek, but entered an inlet known as Jerusalem Bay, at altitude lower than surrounding terrain, where it commenced a steep right turn and dived into the water. None of those on board survived the 31 December 2017 accident. Medical specialists sought toxicology tests on blood samples, says the Australian Transport Safety Bureau, while the draft investigation report was being reviewed. The results of the tests came back in March, indicating that the pilot and two passengers had elevated carbon monoxide levels. After scrutinising the validity of the findings, the bureau states that the levels of carbon monoxide were ""likely to have adversely affected the pilot's ability to control the aircraft”. All three victims were probably exposed within the aircraft cabin, it says, and a further examination of the aircraft has determined that a crack in the engine exhaust collector ring could have leaked exhaust into the engine bay. This exhaust would not have been contined in the engine bay because three of the eight bolts used to secure magneto access panels beneath the instrument panel were missing.  ""Any breach in the firewall can allow gases to enter the cabin from the engine bay,” the inquiry points out. The aircraft (VH-NOO) had undergone a scheduled engine change in early November, about eight weeks before the crash, the engine having being taken from Sydney Seaplanes' other DHC-2. This engine had been disassembled and inspected, with no defects found, before being reassembled and fitted to VH-NOO. Investigators state that the aircraft's logbook indicates it was being serviced in accordance with the operator's approved maintenance system, with daily inspections, engine checks every 50h, and airframe checks every 100h or six months. While the inquiry has yet to reach final conclusions, it is reminding aircraft maintenance organisations of the need to carry out regular and thorough inspection of exhaust systems and firewalls given the risk of potential carbon monoxide exposure. It is also urging pilots and owners of piston-engined aircraft to carry or fit carbon monoxide detectors with alarms to warn of the presence of the lethal gas.",3-Jul-20,"Air Transport, Asia Pacific, Business & General Aviation, Ops & safety"

The government currently holds a 50% stake inTAPafter partially privatising it in 2015. The state originally sold a 61% stake in the airline to Atlantic Gateway – a consortium comprised of Portuguese businessman Humberto Pedrosa andJetBlue AirwaysandAzulfounder David Neeleman – but later increased its shareholding back up to 50% from 34%. This left Atlantic Gateway with a 45% stake, the remaining 5% being held byTAPemployees.

In addition, the Indian air force's existing fleet of 59 MiG-29s will be upgraded to the MiG-29M standard, says the nation's defence ministry. The value of the new MiG deal is pegged at INR74 billion ($964 million), and the Su-30MKI deal at INR107 billion. The Su-30MKIs will be locally produced by Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL). The acquisitions are part of a broader INR389 billion package of defence spending that provides weapons and equipment for India's army and navy as well. In addition to new aircraft and upgrades, the air force will also get an unspecified number of the locally-developed Astra beyond-visual-range air-to-air missile. The acquisition of the MiGs, which has long been discussed in Indian media, was given fresh impetus following a recent border squabble with China that resulted in the deaths of several Indian soldiers and an unspecified number of Chinese soldiers. Tensions over the incident are still strong. While the addition of new fighters and the upgrading of older MiG-29s will go some way to shoring up New Delhi's defensive capabilities, the pace of India's airpower development has lagged that of China's for the last two decades. The Indian air force has several outstanding requirements for new aircraft, including a long-running deal for 110 advanced fighters. This process essentially replaced the torturous, yet unfulfilled, medium multi-role combat aircraft acquisition of the 2000s and early 2010s. Candidates include the Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and F-15EX, Dassault Rafale, Eurofighter Typhoon, Lockheed Martin F-16V (rebadged the F-21 for the Indian deal), and Saab Gripen E. New Delhi's direction on this requirement is far from clear, with Indian officials publicly flirting with the idea of modernising the air force fleet with locally-produced types, namely the HAL-built Tejas and developmental Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft.

So far, most airlines have implemented their own coronavirus-related protocols, creating confusion and frustration among travellers. Last month several carriers said they would enforce mask-wearing on their flights, and impose no-fly sanctions on those passengers who refuse to comply. Some lawmakers say the recommendations in the report, while well-meaning, are too little too late. Democratic Senators Richard Blumenthal and Edward Markey, members of the Senate's Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, laud the government for presenting the report at all, but criticise it for its ""unenforceable and woefully inadequate recommendations”. ""We need federally enforceable mandates to keep the travelling public safe,” the senators write on 2 July. ”Moreover, this document merely scratches the surface of the many complex questions that we need to address to ensure safe and healthy air travel.” In the past several weeks, airlines have brought aircraft out of storage and increased their capacity to both domestic and international destinations. United Airlines, for example, said on 1 July that it was adding 25,000 flights to its August schedule. That said, several southern states like Arizona, Texas and Florida are currently experiencing a spike in new cases, which may cause some vacationers to rethink their plans. Some states have imposed quarantine requirements for those passengers returning from high-case regions. On 2 July the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) says it screened 626,516 passengers the day before. That's the third-highest daily throughput since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, but still far below the 2.5 million passengers it screened on the same day a year ago.

Niel Golightly, the senior vice president of communications, stepped down following an employee complaint about the article, published in 1987. Niel Golightly resigns from Boeing Golightly, a former Navy fighter pilot, was appointed to the post in December 2019, succeeding long-time communications chief Anne Toulouse who retired early this year. ""My article was a 29-year-old Cold War navy pilot's misguided contribution to a debate that was live at the time,” Golightly says on 2 July. ""My argument was embarrassingly wrong and offensive.” He adds that the discussion around the article 33 years ago ""quickly opened my eyes, indelibly changed my mind, and shaped the principles of fairness, inclusion, respect and diversity that have guided my professional life since”. The December 1987 article was titled ""No right to fight”, and is still available on the website of the US Naval Institute. An excerpt, available publicly, reads, ""At issue is not whether women can fire M-60s, dogfight MiGs, or drive tanks. Introducing women into combat would destroy the exclusively male intangibles of war fighting and the feminine images of what men fight for€”peace, home, family.” The Chicago-based airframer's chief executive and president David Calhoun says that Golightly's views do not represent the company's. ""I want to emphasise our company's unrelenting commitment to diversity and inclusion in all its dimensions, and to ensuring that all of our employees have an equal opportunity to contribute and excel,” he says. The US military removed restrictions on women serving in combat roles in 2013. Three years later all of these combat roles were open to both men and women. Golightly's resignation is the third high-profile departure from the company's communications team in the past seven months. In addition to Toulouse, Boeing's vice president of communications for its Commercial Airplanes unit, Linda Mills, left the company in late 2019. Boeing says it has launched a search for Golightly's successor and in the interim the communications function will be run by Greg Smith, executive vice president of enterprise operations and chief financial officer",3-Jul-20,"Aerospace, Airframers, North America"

In particular, the systems are to be installed on the special operation force's AC-130J Ghostrider gunship and MC-130J Commando II transport, says a US Department of Defense (DoD) contract notice posted online on 1 July. The radio frequency countermeasures are designed to jam air- or land-based enemy radar and missile systems, says the DoD. USSOCOM relies upon countermeasures, as well as other tactics, to suppress anti-aircraft weapons when flying special forces troops behind enemy lines. Sierra Nevada says it will integrate a radio frequency countermeasure system supplied by Northrop Grumman, but declines to go into detail on what sort of customisation it will provide. ""[Sierra Nevada's] approach to aircraft survivability emphasises full platform integration leveraging platform datalinks, integrated processing, and common tactical display systems,” the company says.

""ACI and IATA are aligned on this issue... public funding of health measures should be ensured, including but not limited to infrastructure or operational changes needed for their implementation.” IATA and ACI note their backing for ICAO's TakeOff guidance, which was adopted by the UN body in early June in response to the coronavirus outbreak. It outlines a number of new measures for safeguarding public health that are already being introduced by airports and airlines around the world, including health checks, sanitisation and social distancing. The funding for those measures should come from governments, the two bodies suggest, although airlines and airport operators ""should be included in national discussions to assess the practicalities of implementing the solutions proposed by ICAO aimed at harmonisation across jurisdictions”. The ICAO measures are important, they explain, because ""a patchwork of different frameworks risks confusing travellers, introducing inefficiencies and unnecessary additional compliance costs” for passengers, airports and airlines. ""The aviation industry wants to get the world moving again,” states IATA director general Alexandre de Juniac. ""We have successfully worked with ICAO and many governments worldwide to put in place standardised protocols that safeguard public health and give travellers the confidence to return to the skies.

Over 80% of surveyed travellers indicated unwillingness to travel at all while a quarantine was in place, IATA warns.

""AME has the highest number of countries in the world with government-imposed quarantine measures on arriving passengers. ""The region is effectively in complete lockdown with the travel and tourism sector shuttered. This is detrimental in a region where 8.6 million people depend on aviation for their livelihoods.” IATA is urging AME governments to adopt a ""layering of measures” to enable air travel to restart safely, with a focus on reducing the risk of importing coronavirus via passengers and mitigating the risk when infected people do cross borders. Measures the association advocates include discouraging symptomatic passengers from travelling, including through airlines offering flexibility on ticket changes, health screening, Covid-19 testing, contact tracing, and following of ICAO's safety guidelines to minimise onboard infection. ""Implementing a layered approach should give governments the confidence to open borders without quarantine, and passengers the confidence to fly,” adds Albakri.

""During three days of testing this week, FAA pilots and engineers evaluated Boeing's proposed changes in connection with the automated flight control system on the aircraft,” the FAA says on 1 July. ""While completion of the flights is an important milestone, a number of key tasks remain, including evaluating the data gathered during these flights.” ""The agency is following a deliberate process and will take the time it needs to thoroughly review Boeing's work. We will lift the grounding order only after FAA safety experts are satisfied that the aircraft meets certification standards,” the regulatory body says. Certification flights are among the final steps prior to the FAA issuing an airworthiness directive (AD) lifting the grounding. The AD will specify measures operators must take before returning the jets to revenue service. Boeing has said it expects the AD will come in time to permit it to resume 737 Max deliveries in the third quarter of the year.

In a scathing 52-page report published on 1 July, the Department of Transportation's (DOT) Inspector General writes that the Chicago-based manufacturer did not share vital information about the new aircraft's Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) during the lengthy process, thus significantly downplaying the risk that it posed. The MCAS system as designed on the 737 Max relies on inputs from one angle of attack (AOA) sensor on the exterior of the aircraft. Should this sensor malfunction or deliver faulty information, the system could be triggered erroneously, and cause the aircraft to crash. The report says, in essence, that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) was kept in the dark about potential dangers of the flawed system, and therefore it was not able to adequately test or otherwise address it. ""Early in the process, Boeing included limited information in initial briefings to FAA on the MAX's flight control software, MCAS, which subsequently has been cited as a contributing or potentially contributing factor in both accidents,” the watchdog report states. ""Boeing presented the software as a modification to the existing speed trim system that would only activate under certain limited conditions. As such, MCAS was not an area of emphasis in FAA's certification efforts and therefore did not receive a more detailed review or discussion between FAA engineers and Boeing.” ""As a result, FAA was not well positioned to mitigate any risks related to MCAS,” the report reads. The report is rife with examples that show how Boeing downplayed the technical changes on the Max from previous generations of 737 aircraft. The manufacturer's employees who were authorized by the FAA under the regulator's ""Organization Designation Authorization” (ODA) to act as its representatives during the process, portrayed MCAS ""as a modification and not a new function”. The FAA had created the ODA process in 2005, delegating some of the functions around certification to approved aerospace manufacturers, in order to standardise processes and potentially save time. Critics have described the ODA process as being ripe for abuse, saying that companies can place undue pressure on their employees assigned to ODA units. During a technical familiarisation meeting in May 2012, for example, the MCAS was included as a ""provisional modification to address the plane's tendency to pitch upwards at high speeds”, but it was not emphasised as an area of focus. Just two lines of text in a set of 500 presentation slides referred to the system, the IG's report says. As a result, the FAA required no additional simulator training for pilots who were already qualified to fly previous generation 737NG aircraft even though the system was indeed a significant change from those aircraft. That aligned with Boeing's and potential customers' goals to keep training costs down as they integrated the new aircraft into their fleets. Only after the first crash on 28 October 2018 did the FAA begin to take a closer look at the newly installed stabilisation system. During the short flight of Lion Air 610, MCAS was activated ""based on faulty data from the aircraft's external AOA sensor over 20 times, which led to loss of control of the aircraft.” The aircraft crashed into the Java Sea, killing all 189 aboard. But even then, a Boeing-issued bulletin to operators - which prompted an FAA Emergency Airworthiness Directive, both in early November - did not specifically mention MCAS as a source of concern. ""This was the first time that FAA's certification engineers had performed a detailed review of MCAS, and according to several FAA certification engineers, it was also the first time they were presented with a full picture of how MCAS worked,” the report says. On 10 March 2019, Ethiopian Airlines flight 302 crashed just after take-off from Addis Ababa airport, killing 157, and once again MCAS was determined to be a decisive factor in the accident during which the pilots lost control of the aircraft. Two days later, on 12 March 2019, aviation authorities around the world began grounding the aircraft. Over the past 16 months the grounding has led to a change in the leadership at the top of the world's biggest aircraft manufacturer, and flushed out embarrassing lapses in judgement by Boeing employees working on the aircraft programme. A trove of emails published in January contained foul language and disparaging remarks, painting a picture of company culture that was not aligned with its public commitment to safety. They show instances during which Boeing employees openly mocked company management, the US regulator and the ease of which certification was pushed through. In one set of emails, a Boeing employee had said the aircraft ""is designed by clowns who in turn are supervised by monkeys.” They called the design of the aircraft ""piss poor”. Another complained about the FAA's ""whining”, as well as internal processes which slowed development of the aircraft. For its part, Boeing says on 1 July that the company has made ""substantial changes... to further enhance our commitment to safety [and] to improve our support to the regulatory process”. ""We have made robust improvements to the 737 Max flight control software, including ensuring MCAS cannot be activated based on signals from a single sensor and cannot be activated repeatedly,” Boeing says. ""We have dedicated all resources necessary to ensure that the improvements to the 737 Max are comprehensive and thoroughly tested. We have also taken a number of actions to further improve the safety culture of our company.” ""When the Max returns to service, it will be one of the most thoroughly scrutinised aircraft in history, and we have full confidence in its safety,” Boeing adds. The FAA has started recertification flights with the 737 Max earlier this week. These flights are among the final step prior to the FAA issuing an AD lifting the grounding.

The modification kit offers a host of improvements over the baseline aircraft. Key among these are twin 1,200shp (850kW) Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A-67A engines in place of the original 1,050shp PT6A-60As. ""The uprated engines not only increase the aircraft maximum cruise by up to 40kt [74km/h], the extra horsepower provides improved first, second, and third segment climb capability, greater take-off performance in high-and-hot conditions, and increased single-engine service ceilings,” says Blackhawk. The ability to climb from sea level to 35,000ft in 18min - more than twice the rate of the baseline 350 - is particularly important for military or governmental applications as it ""significantly reduces exposure within hostile airspace”, adds the Waco, Texas-based firm. A five-blade composite propeller, from German manufacturer MT Propeller, replaces the baseline 350's Hartzell four-blade aluminum component which ""reduces cabin and exterior noise by at least 5dB”. Other features include uprated landing gear, Raisbeck fully enclosed high floatation gear doors, a True Blue Power TB44 lithium-ion battery - delivering a 14kg (30lb) weight saving - and extra fuel tanks to boost the 350's range and endurance ""to meet the most demanding mission requirements”. Blackhawk says the modification kit covers the 350 and 350i models, of which there are over 1,100 examples in service worldwide. The upgrade can be performed at one of Blackhawk's 80 owned or approved installation centres across the globe. The company is in advanced discussions with several unnamed ”governmental entities” with initial orders ”expected to close in the third quarter,” says Blackhawk.",2-Jul-20,"Business & General Aviation, MRO"

Pilots flew in ""a highly contested simulated environment” during final acceptance test of the Distributed Mission Training system at Nellis AFB in Nevada, Lockheed Martin said on 1 July. The Distributed Mission Training system was developed by Lockheed in partnership with the F-35 Joint Program Office and the USAF. In the future, the training network ought to be able to connect to other aircraft simulators, including those for the Boeing F-15 fighter, says Lockheed. The Distributed Mission Training system is to be used for continuous pilot training and simulated large force exercises of pilots at dispersed locations. In particular, the system is for training pilots on ""advanced tactics” needed in multi-domain operations, says Lockheed. That is, the simulator is a cheaper and more easily repeatable way of teaching USAF pilots how to co-ordinate complex missions with virtual compatriots in the US Space Force, US Navy (USN) and US Army. ""The initial delivery at Nellis AFB is a major step forward, as it establishes the framework for F-35 simulators around the world to interconnect,” says the company. ""Previously, F-35 simulators allowed up to four pilots at a facility to fly together in simulated combat.

For a long time Washington has operated its fleet of unmanned aircraft with impunity over places like Iraq or Afghanistan - areas where terrorists and insurgents had no means to shoot down UAVs. However, the civil war in Libya, as well as standoffs with Iran, have pulled the US Air Force's (USAF) remotely piloted fleet of aircraft into increasingly dangerous territory. As a result, the service has lost aircraft to shoot downs in the past 12 months. FlightGlobal looks at the impact of surface-to-air missiles in the Middle East and changes that have resulted recently.

How Western armed forces should be set up in this new era is the subject of much deliberation, but at least one study has reached the encouraging conclusion that a significant contribution to readiness and deterrence can be made by redeploying existing aircraft. According to the Washington DC-based Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments (CSBA), ""In an era of renewed great power competition, one of the most significant challenges the United States and its allies face is the need to deny China or Russia the ability to launch opportunistic acts of aggression against an ally or partner in the Western Pacific or Eastern Europe.” The CSBA contends that those regions could be effectively patrolled by ""a network of existing non-stealthy long-endurance unmanned aircraft systems to maintain real-time, persistent situational awareness in key geographic areas”. In an April 2020 report titled Deterrence by Detection: A Key Role for Unmanned Aircraft Systems in Great Power Competition, the CSBA says that by pooling existing resources to maintain a fleet of just 92 aircraft, the USA and its allies and partners could deliver the ""real-time situational awareness” needed to counter ""sub-conventional gray zone aggression” and provide early warning against ""a conventional fait accompli gambit” – for example, a Russian land-grab in the Baltics or Chinese move against Taiwan – which would be very difficult to reverse after the fact. This ""deterrence by detection” strategy, the CSBA says, would involve sustaining long-endurance unmanned aerial reconnaissance of the Taiwan Strait, South China Sea, and East China Sea in the Asia-Pacific, and the Baltics, Black Sea, and eastern Mediterranean Sea in Europe. Surveillance would also be required along the Chinese coastline. In the view of authors Thomas Mahnken, Travis Sharp and Grace Kim: ""Our adversaries are less likely to commit opportunistic acts of aggression if they know they are being watched constantly and that their actions can be publicised widely. Real-time situational awareness can contribute to meeting the fait accompli challenge.” US Air Force (USAF) planning does not, however, support this emphasis on existing, non-stealthy unmanned air vehicles (UAVs). Indeed, after suffering several prominent shoot-downs in 2019, the air force plans to reduce the size of its long-endurance unmanned fleet and invest its funds elsewhere. In a surprise move within its fiscal year 2021 budget request, the service revealed in February that it wants to stop buying the General Atomics Aeronautical Systems MQ-9 Reaper in FY2020. It also wants to retire 21 of its 31 Northrop Grumman RQ-4 Global Hawks, particularly older Block 20 and Block 30 variants. As the USAF shifts its focus away from counter-terrorism and anti-insurgency and towards foes such as China and Russia, it calculates that its money will be better spent on aircraft, subsystems and weapons that can safely operate within range of sophisticated surface-to-air missiles. Despite this, two long-endurance UAV manufacturers – General Atomics and Northrop – believe their products could play a role in preventing conflict with China and Russia. Both companies point to the CSBA study to back their claims, arguing that their respective MQ-9 and RQ-4 aircraft could, despite their vulnerability to surface-to-air weapons, play key surveillance roles. The CSBA sees persistent patrol by such aircraft as an important ""trip wire” that would give the USA and allies more time to ""ensure that forward-postured forces are prepared to respond decisively”. UAVs, the authors argue, maintain four great advantages: time on station; cost per flight hour; lower risk to human life; and manned-unmanned teaming efficiencies. The MQ-9 has a flight endurance of 27h and operates up to 50,000ft, while the RQ-4 can stay aloft for more than 30h at up to 60,000ft. Both aircraft can carry a variety of payloads including electro-optical/infrared cameras, radar, communications relays and signals intelligence electronics. ""[UAVs] generally provide greater time-on-station persistence than satellites or manned aircraft,” says the CSBA. UAVs can also be cheaper to fly. ""It would cost $59 million per year to use an MQ-9 to maintain round-the-clock coverage of a 1,000nm [1,850km] orbit, compared to $1.8 billion for a manned ISR aircraft to provide the same coverage,” says the report. Moreover, by keeping pilots out of harm's way, unmanned aircraft could prevent a geopolitical crisis. ""In 2017, US forces in Syria twice shot down Iranian-made armed drones and Iranian armed forces shot down a US Navy RQ-4 Global Hawk in 2019,” the CSBA notes. ""In these instances, escalation dynamics may have been more likely to spiral into armed conflict had the downed aircraft been manned.” Lastly, UAVs can increase the efficiency of manned aircraft. ""By relying on [UAVs] to conduct initial persistent, wide-area searches and later cueing manned aircraft to conduct more focused follow-on searches, military commanders are able to conserve their manned forces for missions that do not suit [UAVs],” the report says. UAVs have disadvantages, however. Compared to manned alternatives, the MQ-9 and RQ-4 typically fly slower, struggle to react quickly or improvise in unanticipated situations, and lack defensive measures. They are also not stealthy, the report notes. Nonetheless, the CSBA argues that the advantages of long-endurance UAVs outweigh their vulnerabilities.

The UK budget carrier on 1 July resumed regular flights from Berlin after their suspension because of the coronavirus crisis. Verdi says Easyjet intends to reduce its local fleet to 18 aircraft by year-end, from a total of 34 aircraft stationed at Berlin'sTegelandSchonefeldairports before the pandemic. Some 738 jobs ofEasyJet's 1,540 local employees will be made redundant, the union expects.  EasyJetexpanded its operation in Berlin in late 2017 – followingAir Berlin's demise – and added around 1,000 employees to its local staff, many of whom came from the insolvent German airline, Verdi notes. It adds thatEasyJetwill discontinue German domestic routes as part of the cuts. Cirium schedules data shows thatEasyJetserves Cologne, Dortmund, Dusseldorf, Frankfurt, Munich, Stuttgart and the German island Sylt from Berlin. Verdi aviation secretary Holger Rossler states that the carrier's decision is ""incomprehensible to us and cannot be explained by the pandemic”. He argues that Berlin's long-delayed Brandenburg airport – now set to open in October – will ""open up new opportunities for air traffic” in the city. ""WhyEasyJetnow halves its presence in Berlin remains to be seen,” he adds. EasyJetconfirms that it has started consultations with pilot and flight-attendant representatives about a ""reduction in the number of aircraft and staff stationed in Berlin”, without disclosing specific targets. Citing IATA projections that passenger demand will not recover to pre-crisis levels before 2023, the airline pledges to work closely with employee representatives, provide ""full support” for affected staff, and ""inform the Verdi union accordingly”. EasyJetchief executive Johan Lundgren states: ""Unfortunately the lower-demand environment means we need fewer aircraft and have less opportunity for work for our people”. He says the airline must ""focus on profitable flying”, but insists: ""Berlin remains a strategically important part of our network.” Citing ""significant investments” in the German capital, he says ""we will remain Berlin's largest carrier [and] fully committed to the base and its long-term success”. Verdi describesEasyJet's decision as ""premature” and warns it will have ""economic consequences” for Berlin's new airport The union is calling on the city's government and that of surrounding state Brandenburg to ""intervene and... save as many of the jobs atEasyJetas possible”. Berlin airport's chief executive, Engelbert Lutke Daldrup, acknowledged EasyJet's operational reduction during a 1 July press conference but said the budget carrier had committed to maintaining Berlin's status as its second-largest base outside the UK. He says Easyjet plans to operate about 55% of its pre-crisis capacity in Berlin this and next year, and decide about further activities in 2022. In a separate, joint statement by Easyjet and airport operator FBB about the resumption of flights, the airline says it intends to operate almost three-quarters of its network from Berlin by August, deploying up to five aircraft atSchonefeldand four atTegel. Under the plan, the number of destinations is set to rise from the current 39 to around 50 by August. EasyJet tells Cirium that the German government should – ""in this time” – support the nation's aviation industry ""as a whole rather than an individual company” through ""co-ordinated intervention”.

United Airlines and Delta Air Lines say they are raising their capacity to between 35-40% of normal during the 2020 summer travel season. For its part, American Airlines has announced a ""reset” on its international network, utilising more partners in order to increase profitability for what it expects will be a prolonged period of low demand to those long-haul destinations. ""Covid-19 has forced us to reevaluate our network,” American's chief revenue officer Vasu Raja says. ""American will have a significantly smaller international network in the year ahead, but we are using this opportunity to hit reset and create a network using the strength of our strategic hubs that we can build and grow upon and be profitable on in this new environment.” Some flights that will be permanently axed from the schedule include three connections each from Charlotte and Philadelphia, two east coast hubs that are popular with travelers to Europe. American will also cut several connections from Los Angeles to Asia, and will shift its major trans-pacific hub to Dallas/Fort Worth. Miami will remain the carrier's primary hub for flights to the Caribbean and Latin America, the airline says. UNITED ADDS 25,000 FLIGHTS Chicago-based United says on 1 July that it will add nearly 25,000 flights during the month of August, tripling its schedule size from June. The carrier says it will add 350 daily flights from its US hubs including more connections to mountain and national park destinations such as Aspen, Colorado; Bangor, Maine; Bozeman, Montana; and Jackson Hole, Wyoming. It will be flying almost 50% of its domestic schedule in August compared to 30% in June, and resume 50 routes in August that it did not have in its July schedule, United says. ""We're taking the same data-driven, realistic approach to growing our schedule as we did in drawing it down at the start of the pandemic,” says Ankit Gupta, United's vice president of domestic network planning. ""Demand is coming back slowly and we're building in enough capacity to stay ahead of the number of people traveling.” The airline also says it will return to several non-US destinations such as Tahiti, Mexico and the Caribbean, and offer more options for passengers traveling to Brussels, Frankfurt, London, Munich, Paris and Zurich. United's expansion comes even as the European Unionl continues to bar non-Europeans traveling from the United States for non-essential reasons due to spiking coronavirus cases in the US.

IATA notes that passenger demand in May was down 91% from the same month last year. This represents a ""mild uptick” from the 94% annual drop seen in April, driven by a recovery in domestic markets, especially China. But data from the second half of June shows that as the number of worldwide coronavirus cases has accelerated over the period, net bookings have again begun to decline. Speaking during IATA's weekly press call, chief economist Brian Pearce highlighted that although June looked better than May ""on average”, the reduction during the second half of the month ""is causing us to be cautious about prospects in the next few months”. He adds that there is a ""downside risk” to the association's current projections. ""We still expect an improvement, but not as much as our baseline,” says Pearce. Illustrating the deteriorating market conditions, Pearce showed an updated estimate of revenue passenger-kilometres for 2020 with a downside risk scenario under which RPKs recover only to a fall of 53% in December 2020, versus the recently published baseline scenario of a 36% reduction. The risk is largely focused on emerging markets and US international flights, as these regions are seeing the bulk of the rise in fresh cases. Together they account for 37% of global RPKs. Looking at the wider market, Pearce notes that growing business confidence will not necessarily translate to higher corporate travel numbers because companies are likely to be reluctant to allow their staff to travel while the risk of infection remains. The majority of passengers travel for leisure or to visit friends and family, but confidence among this constituency also remains low. Besides domestic Chinese demand, ""[in] other key markets – the US, Germany, UK – we've not really seen a pick-up at all in confidence”, Pearce points out. IATA director general Alexandre de Juniac offers a frank assessment: ""May was not quite as terrible as April. That's about the best thing that can be said. ""As predicted, the first improvements in passenger demand are occurring in domestic markets. International traffic remained virtually stopped in May.

The fracture in the right-hand Pratt & Whitney PW4000 fan blade, during cruise at 36,000ft on 13 February 2018, led to the loss of most of the inlet duct and all of the left and right fan cowls. It also resulted in debris – believed to be from a blade – puncturing the right-hand side of the fuselage, just below the window line. Extensive inlet damage was caused to the PW4000 engine after the blade failure National Transportation Safety Board investigators found that Pratt & Whitney developed a new inspection process, known as thermal acoustic imaging, around 2005. This process was designed to inspect the interior surfaces of the PW4000 fan blades, and detect cracking in the hollow core, using sound energy to generate friction across any discontinuities which can then be picked up by thermal sensors. Pratt & Whitney classified the process as 'new and emerging technology', in line with industry practice for newly-introduced non-destructive inspection methods. This meant it did not need to develop a formal initial and recurrent training programme. But the inquiry found that – even after 13 years – the manufacturer was using the same classification for the technique, despite having inspected over 9,000 blades, and did not have a defined training and certification regime. Two shift inspectors, including the one who last inspected the blade, told the inquiry that their training on the technique amounted to 40h on-the-job training, whereas certification for eddy current and ultrasonic inspection involved extensive classroom training and up to 1,600h of practical experience. ""At one point [Pratt & Whitney] did provide training on [the technique],” says the inquiry. ""However, neither of the two inspectors were permitted to attend the training so that they could work to clear out a backlog of blades in the shop.” The inspector who worked on the blade also claimed that there was no feedback from engineers about whether any blade rejections were valid or false. Investigators determined that thermal acoustic imaging inspections of the United 777 blade in March 2010 and in July 2015 revealed indications in the same location as the subsequent low-cycle fatigue crack. This finding, after the incident, spurred Pratt & Whitney to order a review of over 9,600 previously-inspected blades. Pratt & Whitney also reported that they had developed a curriculum for initial and recurrent training on the inspection technique following the event.

Instead, the UN body agreed on 30 June, the baseline will be calculated using only 2019 emissions data. ""Council states today have made a measured assessment and have come to the most reasonable solution available given our current and very extraordinary circumstances,” states ICAO Council president Salvatore Sciacchitano. The coronavirus outbreak has significantly reduced international aviation operations, ICAO says, meaning the 2020 data would skew the two-year average and create ""an inappropriate economic burden to aeroplane operators, due to the need to offset more emissions although they are flying less and generating less emissions”. As part of CORSIA's phased introduction, a first tranche of airlines is due to begin offsetting growth in CO2 emissions from international operations in 2021. That carbon-neutral growth was originally intended to be based on an average of emissions data from operations in 2019 and 2020, but the calculation will now be based solely on data from the former year. Absent such an amendment, the baseline would have been much lower than expected – a development that would ""disrespect the originally-agreed intention and objectives of ICAO's 193 Member States when they adopted CORSIA in October 2016”, says ICAO. The organisation notes that an earlier resolution included ""modalities to adjust CORSIA both in case of an unforeseen circumstance that affects the sustainability of the scheme or an inappropriate economic burden such as that caused by Covid-19”. Other elements of CORSIA have also been amended to consider only 2019 data, including the ""emission threshold for CORSIA new entrants, and the selection of an operators' emission basis for offset calculation during the pilot phase”. ICAO adds that ""there could be implications to the subsequent phases of CORSIA in light of how the sector's recovery would take place, and more data and analysis of the situation and impacts on CORSIA will be needed”. Bodies such as airline industry association IATA and the Air Transport Action Group (ATAG) – an independent coalition of which IATA is a member alongside organisations including Airbus, Boeing and Airports Council International – had called for 2020 data to be excluded from the baseline in recent months.

El Al has also had to cope with the impact of deteriorating aircraft values, because conditions attached to certain loans require a minimum ratio to be maintained between the value of aircraft and the loans secured on them. Non-compliance would give the lending banks the right to a $30 million payment, but the airline has obtained a waiver from the ratio requirement. Consultancy BDO has carried out a valuation of the El Al fleet, which comprised 45 aircraft at the end of March. El Al's revenues for the first quarter slumped by 25% to $321 million, the airline states. But its operating expenditure only fell by 10%, to $362 million, in the same period. The carrier's pre-tax loss of $161 million was more than double the $71 million figure recorded for the first quarter of 2019. It has been negotiating a $400 million loan backed by the government, and prepared a business plan outlining a number of scenarios – including ""streamlining” measures and a ""gradual and limited” operation of the fleet – for an exit from the crisis. El Al says the loan is conditional on a number of issues including a new collective agreement with employees, to improve efficiency, the release of surplus funds from a central repository, and completion of certain sale-and-leaseback transactions. Israel's government has been proposing an alternative plan involving a combination of a $250 million loan and the issue of $150 million in new shares. El Al reached an agreement in the last week of June to amend working agreements with its cabin crew, a deal aimed at saving $30 million. The agreement was reached with the trade union centre Histadrut and the transport workers' union. El Al employs around 1,400 flight attendants.",1-Jul-20,"Air Transport, El Al, Middle East"

A multinational unit formed with personnel from Belgium, the Czech Republic, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Norway will operate an eight-strong fleet of Airbus Defence & Space A330 multi-role tanker transports (MRTTs) via an initiative launched by the European Defence Agency (EDA) in 2012. An acquisition via Europe's OCCAR defence procurement agency was launched after the lack of dedicated tanker aircraft among European NATO nations was highlighted during the Alliance-led Operation Unified Protector campaign over Libya the previous year. A first tanker/transport for the NATO Multinational MRTT Fleet (MMF) arrived in Eindhoven on 30 June, following a transfer from Airbus's Getafe modification site near Madrid. The aircraft carries the registration T-055. ""This is a prime example of European defence cooperation done in close coordination with NATO, which shows that once a capability shortfall has been jointly identified, European nations can pull together, work on a common project aimed at filling the gap, and eventually deliver,” says EDA chief executive Jiri Sedivy. ""It's pooling and sharing at its best,” he adds. ""The aircraft can help respond to crises such as the Covid-19 emergency, by moving medical supplies and conducting medical evacuations. However, the fleet will probably have the most profound impact within the air-to-air refuelling mission, an area where historically many European allies have lacked capacity,” says NATO assistant secretary general for defence investment Camille Grand. ""Therefore, the MRTT fleet will help contribute to a fairer transatlantic burden-sharing at NATO.” Supplied in a 200-seat passenger configuration, the MMF's Rolls-Royce Trent 772-powered A330s feature underwing hose-and-drogue refuelling pods and a boom installed beneath the rear fuselage. A second A330 is due for arrival in July, with deliveries to continue at roughly six-month intervals until all eight ordered examples are in use before the end of 2024. Five aircraft will operate from the MMF's main operating base in Eindhoven, with the other three to be located in Cologne. If further options are exercised, the pooled fleet could eventually be increased to 11 aircraft.",1-Jul-20,"Defence, Fixed-wing, NATO"

Revenue for the quarter ended 31 March fell by 30.1% year-on-year to $768 million, led by a 29.2% decline in revenues from scheduled passenger services to nearly $655 million. The carrier's expenses declined 9.9% to nearly $946 million, due to a reduction in costs associated with flying operations, airports, as well as passenger services. On the other hand, administrative and aircraft maintenance costs increased. Despite the operating profit, the airline recorded a net loss of $120 million due to significantly higher finance costs, compared to a $20.5 million net profit in the first quarter of 2019. As of 31 March, Garuda had $163 million in cash and cash equivalents, down from $337 million a year before. The SkyTeam alliance member says it is exploring options to overcome challenges caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. These include rightsizing capacity, offering discounts on selected routes, optimising cargo and charter services, renegotiating with its vendors to reduce cost and obtain payment delays, and early termination of aircraft leases. It will also work in ""close coordination” with the Indonesian government, particularly on any potential evaluation to the price floor and price ceiling on air tickets, following the government's decision on 8 June to impose a 70% capacity limit on all aircraft in a bid to contain the spread of Covid-19.",1-Jul-20,"Airlines, Asia Pacific, Coronavirus"

Announced on 24 June, Brussels says the move was driven by the type's ""limited operational output which is due to imperfect industrial support (which is threatened to reduce in the coming years), and the requirement for necessary but costly upgrades”. Among Belgium's chief complaints are the ""very long lead times for the delivery of spares, the very long turnaround times for repairs and responsiveness related to engineering advice”. As a result, ""operational output” has been ""limited in quantity, not quality”, says the nation's defence ministry. ""With four helicopters we were able to deliver a very limited operational output only, during certain periods per year and provided there was a long lead-time.” Low serviceability levels ""worsened this situation”, it adds. The NH90 TTHs have an availability rate of just 38%, which ""is very similar to the average availability of all NH90 users”, says the defence ministry. In addition, it expects support from NHI – which comprises Airbus Helicopters, Leonardo Helicopters and Fokker – will reduce in the future. ""Given the [multiple] configurations of the TTH variant [developed] during the execution of the programme, the industrial support will decline during the whole duration of the programme,” it adds. That issue has dogged the NH90 for many years, with executives repeatedly attempting to reign in the country-specific modifications which have added complexity for the industrial partners. In addition, future upgrades are needed for ""operational and legal reasons” which would take 18 months per helicopter, the ministry says. NHI was unavailable to comment. While Belgium also cites a lack of personnel as a reason for the future reduction in flights, it says there is no lack of TTH pilots. In fact ""we will even have to reorient some TTH pilots to other platforms”, it says. This may include the four maritime NFH variants operated in support of the navy, which are now the ministry's ""primary focus”. Options for the future helicopter support of the land forces, including medical evacuation missions, are still being studied, it adds. Separately, Belgium has announced that it will ""accelerate the retirement” of its three Israel Aerospace Industries B-Hunter unmanned air vehicles. These are plagued by ""low availability” and ""no longer meet the standards and requirements of current operational theatres”. ""Early decommissioning will allow personnel to optimally prepare for the planned deployment in 2023 of the [General Atomics Aeronautical Systems] MQ-9B SkyGuardian and to strengthen other weapon systems,” says the ministry.",1-Jul-20,"Defence, Europe, Helicopters"

The failure occurred in engine No. 1 after the aircraft, 9M-XXE (MSN1075), took off from Perth operating flight XAX237 to Kuala Lumpur on 25 June 2017, says the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) in its final report into the incident, which it classifies as ""serious.”  ""Approximately one hour into the flight, during a step change in altitude, the flight crew heard a metallic bang, significant vibration started through the airframe and ENG 1 [left] STALL warning was presented to the flight crew,” says ATSB. ""The flight crew completed the relevant engine failure procedure and commenced a single-engine return to Perth.” After the aircraft landed safely, it was observed that three quarters of one fan blade was missing. Investigations revealed that the failure was due to a premature onset of fatigue cracking in a high-stress area, stemming from an artefact of the blade's manufacturing process. ""As a result of a number of previous fan blade failures, the engine manufacturer had instigated a non-destructive inspection programme designed to detect internal cracking,” says ATSB. ""Although the failed blade had been subjected to this inspection, the fatigue crack progressed to failure before its next scheduled inspection. As such, it was found that the inspection interval was too great to capture the crack that developed in this blade before it reached a critical size.” ATSB cited a number of safety actions taken by R-R to address the issue, namely service bulletins. One cut the inspection interval from 2,400 to 1,200 cycles, another introduced an improved inspection process. One service bulletin called for the inspection of fan blades that had showed defects during their last inspection that were below the threshold for action. ""This investigation demonstrates the importance for manufacturers of critical components, and regulators monitoring the manufacturers, to have systems in place to quickly identify core issues and put in place measurers to mitigate risk,” says the ATSB. ""This incident represents a good example of how manufacturers, through quick and positive actions can communicate engineering solutions and technical information to operators and maintenance providers through messages, service bulletins and service letters.” None of the 10 crew or 357 passengers were injured during the incident.",1-Jul-20,"Asia Pacific, Ops & safety"

In a major update to the country's 2016 Defence White Paper, Canberra will invest approximately A$270 billion in defence over the next 10 years, with an eye to deterring foes at longer ranges and securing supply chains. ""Our region is in the midst of the most consequential strategic realignment since the Second World War, and trends including military modernisation, technological disruption and the risk of state-on-state conflict are further complicating our nation's strategic circumstances,” says prime minister Scott Morrison. ""The Indo-Pacific is at the centre of greater strategic competition, making the region more contested and apprehensive. These trends are continuing and will potentially sharpen as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.” The update covers all areas of military power: air, land, sea, space, and cyber. The air domain will cover 24% of all spending, second behind the maritime domain with 28%. ""Australia requires a technologically advanced strike and air combat capability which must be capable of defeating threats as far from Australia or its deployed forces as possible,” says the update. ""As well as possessing potent weapons, our air combat capabilities must be fully integrated with supporting intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance and logistics systems.” The update stresses continued acquisition of the Royal Australian Air Force's (RAAF's) planned 72 Lockheed Martin F-35As, adding that a replacement will be sought in the late 2030s. A replacement for the Boeing EA-18G Growler electronic warfare aircraft is also foreseen from the late 2020s. An ""Additional Air Combat Capability” with funding of A$4.5-6.7 billion is listed from the mid-to-late 2020s. It is not clear precisely what this refers to, but local trade publicationADBRsuggests it could mean upgrading Royal Australian Air Force Boeing F/A-18F Super Hornets to a Block III configuration, acquiring additional F-35As, or adding unmanned combat air systems - or some combination of these options. ""Teaming Air Vehicles” are listed as a separate requirement, with funding planned from the late 2020s out to 2040. In addition, the Boeing E-7A Wedgetail airborne early warning and control system aircraft will receive capability updates, pending its replacement in the late 2020s. ""Plans for the E-7A replacement will now involve increasing the fleet to provide greater coverage of the highly-complex future air and joint-battlefield environment that will include a proliferation of autonomous systems and long-range and high-speed weapons.” The air force's Lockheed C-130J tactical transports will be replaced from the late 2020s, while the Airbus Defence & Space A330 multi-role tanker transport (MRTT) will be replaced from the early 2030s. In the shorter term, plans for two additional MRTTs (designated the KC-30A in Australian service) will be scrapped, with money saved going to improve the availability of the RAAF's existing inventory. ""New investment will include larger replacement fleets for the C-130J Hercules transport and the KC-30A air-to-air refuelling aircraft,” says a factsheet issued with the update. The KC-30A replacement could include both manned and unmanned systems, to better allow the RAAF to sustain long-range operations. In addition to research on high-speed, long-range strike systems, including hypersonic weapons, the update calls for the ""procurement and integration of advanced longer-range strike weapon systems onto combat aircraft to allow the air force to operate at greater range and avoid increasingly sophisticated air defences.” Loitering munitions will be sought to give the RAAF more options for ""persistent presence and strike in an increasingly complex environment”. Updated self-protection systems will be installed on a ""range of aircraft” to improve survivability against advanced threats. Canberra will also beef up the capabilities of air bases in the country's north to improve their survivability in the event of a chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear attack. Army and naval airpower will also see significant updates. In addition to the ongoing effort to replace the army's Airbus Helicopters Tiger fleet, a new ""long-range rotorcraft” is planned from the late 2020s. As for the navy, the Sikorsky MH-60R is seen as serving beyond 2035. The update also lists a new ""logistics helicopter” that will be obtained from the mid-2020s. ""Improved weapon systems, with longer range and greater survivability, will give Defence the capability to deter or defeat attacks as far from Australia as possible,” states the update.

The airline association says that while global demand as measured by cargo tonne-kilometres fell 20.3% in May compared with the same period last year, global capacity slumped 34.7%. For both demand and capacity, the reductions represent an improvement on April's figures, down 25.6% and 41.6% respectively, but IATA notes that ""capacity remains unable to meet demand as a result of the loss of belly cargo operations on passenger aircraft that have been parked”. Director general Alexandre de Juniac states: ""The gap between demand and capacity shows the challenge in finding the space on the aircraft still flying to get goods to market...

But predicting the length and depth of the recession remains difficult.” Belly capacity for international cargo declined by two-thirds for May against the same month last year. Dedicated air cargo capacity increased by 25% as the industry made heavier use of freighters, but this was not enough to offset the lost volumes from passenger-aircraft groundings.

It is the third Latin American carrier after Colombia's Avianca and Chile's LATAM Airlines to declare bankruptcy as the fallout of the global crisis creates liquidity problems for the region's airlines. The move comes just 11 days after Aeromexico had said publicly that it had no plans to file for bankruptcy, but that it was ""evaluating alternatives to move towards a better financial position”. Reversing its earlier course, the company says it hopes to utilise the process to acquire new financing, increase its liquidity reserves and create ”a sustainable platform to succeed in an uncertain global economy”. ""Our industry faces unprecedented challenges due to significant declines in demand for air transportation,” says Aeromexico chief executive AndrÃ©s Conesa on 30 June. ""We are committed to taking the necessary measures so that we can operate effectively in this new landscape and be well prepared for a successful future when the Covid-19 pandemic is behind us.” The company will continue operations as normal, and all tickets will remain valid, the airline says. Latin American carriers are struggling as the region's governments have been much slower to respond with financial support for the air transport industry than in other parts of the world, such as North America and Europe. Billion-dollar aid packages in those regions have helped airlines stay afloat, at least temporarily, and reorganise their operations after passenger demand dropped off sharply when the coronavirus exploded into a global pandemic earlier this year. LATAM and Avianca both filed for bankruptcy protection in May in order to shield their businesses from creditors. Like Aeromexico, the airlines said they wanted to make sure they are able to restart operations smoothly when passenger demand returns and when travel restrictions are lifted. Air traffic fell by about 96% in Latin America and the Caribbean as the coronavirus pandemic reached its peak in April, and has yet to make any significant steps toward recovery.

For many of them, it's a tough sell. With industry experts forecasting the sector will not fully recover until 2023, and the potential of mass layoffs coming in the fourth quarter when government financial aid runs out, airlines now must walk a fine line between cutting just enough to survive their current liquidity squeeze, but not too much so that it will permanently cripple them when passenger demand returns. ""There are definitely cuts coming,” says Rachel McCarthy, senior vice president for talent at New York-based JetBlue Airways, speaking at a webinar on ""Human Capital in Aviation” led by Aviation Festival Americas on 30 June. ""We know we will be a smaller airline” when the crisis is over, she adds. JetBlue said earlier this month that it would be operating about 50% of its capacity in July and will add more seats in August. Still, that represents a fraction of what the airline was operating six months ago, requiring a reduced number of staff, too. But that said, the impending pilot shortage that had been front and centre for most airline recruiters prior to the advent of the coronavirus pandemic has not gone away. In the coming years, airlines will continue to struggle to fill cockpit roles in the wake of a wave of mandatory retirements. The virus has merely given airlines some time to re-assess their approach. ""As we see the return of travel across the country and retirements continue to mature into the marketplace, we have gotten a three-, four-, five-year reprieve,” says Matt Koscal, chief human resources officer at Republic Airways, which operates routes for American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines. ""We didn't prepare the first time when we knew we had a looming shortage, how do we ensure that we are prepared appropriately now,” he asks. The payroll support program of the CARES Act, which was introduced to help companies manage cash through the crisis, has allowed most US airlines to continue to operate, if at a reduced level. About $25 billion was disbursed to passenger carriers which, in turn, pledged not to implement involuntary layoffs or furloughs until the end of September. ""Absent that intervention we would have had to make deep cuts immediately,” Koscal says. And while layoffs will likely occur in the fourth quarter, Republic is trying to play the long game when it comes to planning for the future. ""This is not the time to cut and run from our investments but it's important to find ways to be more efficient,” he adds. ""How do we work as hard as we can to have as little impact on as few people as possible, but knowing that there's no way we will be at full capacity at the end of the year or in October when the CARES Act expires?” The US Department of Transportation said that US airlines employed 605,341 full-time and 110,561 part-time workers in the middle of April, the most recent month for which data is available. That was some 37,000 fewer than in March. The job figures are expected to continue to decline as long as the cornoavirus continues to spread, as both leisure and business passengers are reluctant to return to air travel for fear of catching or spreading the virus while airborne. Frontier Airlines' chief human resource officer Steve Schuller says that the Denver-based ultra-low-cost carrier is making recruting and hiring decisions week-to-week. At the beginning of the month the airline was ""bullish” that the comeback was imminent, until the infection numbers published over the course of the past week showed cases spiking in southern states. ""There's a lot of unknowns out there,” he says. ”It's a very fluid situation, and each week is a new week.” Miramar-based ultra-low-cost carrier Spirit Airlines is also grappling what it will look like once the government payroll support runs out. Like Frontier, Spirit is a favorite with cost-conscious vacationers, and was hit hard by closures of popular resorts and holiday attractions like the Disney theme parks in Orlando, Florida, or casinos in Las Vegas, as well as the shelter-in-place orders that were imposed across the country. As states have begun to reopen, Spirit has begun to test the market by bringing aircraft out of storage, expanding its network and increasing frequencies. The airline has added flights for July, planning to operate more than 80% of its capacity and serve 63 of the 75 destinations it served during the same month a year ago. Still, that number requires far fewer employees than during ""normal” operations, says Spirit's chief human resources officer Laurie Villa. There will be losers in the coming months, but she too thinks airline employees will remain loyal to the industry. ""Peoples' lives have changed,” she says. ""But our people are very passionate about this industry and love what they do. What we can do as an organisation is be the place that our team members can look to have trust and confidence” during the volatile weeks and months to come.",1-Jul-20,"Airlines, Coronavirus, Frontier Airlines, JetBlue Airways, North America, Republic Airways, Spirit Airlines, Strategy"

The airframer has brought monthly single-aisle production down from 60 to 40 aircraft, while the twin-aisle rate has fallen from 9.5 to six for the A350, and 3.5 to two for the A330neo. Speaking as Airbus revealed plans to cut 15,000 personnel from its global workforce, chief executive Guillaume Faury said the rates demanded were ""still in the same ballpark” and that the airframer's estimates in April were ""not too wrong”. He says Airbus does not expect to adapt the rates significantly over the next few months, beyond minor refinements – although he suggests that any adjustments would more likely be ""a bit more down than up”. Faury points out that the commercial aircraft business activity is down by around 40% and that this sector will bear the burden of the job cuts. But he states that the situation with respect to the workforce adjustments ""could have been significantly worse”. By taking preparatory measures and using the support of government initiatives, he says, the company has managed to avoid a level of job cuts which would have been ""in direct proportion to the [business] impact”. Airbus expects the twin-aisle market to take longer to recover than that for single-aisle jets Faury is forecasting a ""low level” of production for about two years, with the likelihood of a ramp-up from 2022, initially in the single-aisle sector. The downturn for the twin-aisle market, however, will last ""much longer”, he believes. He says Airbus is looking to ""find the right balance” in order not to deplete its skills resources to a level which would threaten its recovery ability.

Highlighting a rising trend, episodes last year accounted for 61% of downings over the past five years, according to UAV crash data gathered by Drone Wars UK, an Oxford-based non-governmental organisation whose long-term goal is to realise an international ban on the use of armed drones, and supplemented with reporting by FlightGlobal. The crashes almost entirely appear over the Middle East, in particular active conflict zones in Libya, Syria and Yemen.  The UAV crash data discussed here was sourced from official government accident reports, plus news articles and social media posts that featured pictures or videos of crashed aircraft. Because governments are reluctant to confirm successful downings, and since some combatants are eager to claim credit for crashes whatever their cause, the true number of UAVs brought down is difficult to know. Nonetheless, there appears to be a clear trend. Increases in suspected or confirmed downings of UAVs coincide with the growing use of unmanned aircraft in the Middle East. The crashes also coincide with the proliferation of surface-to-air missiles in the region. No air force can operate with impunity. ""In Libya, Russian private military companies almost certainly downed a US unarmed, unmanned aircraft in November using a sophisticated Russian air-defence system,” said US Army General Stephen Townsend, commander of US Africa Command, in written testimony to the US House of Representatives Armed Services Committee in March 2020. That UAV was a US Air Force (USAF) General Atomics Aeronautical Systems MQ-9 Reaper. It was likely shot down by a Russian-made Pantsir-S1 surface-to-air missile and gun battery, said USAF General Jeffrey Harrigian, commander of US Air Forces Africa, in February 2020. During a Mitchell Institute press briefing on 29 June, Harrigian explained that the USAF had become too comfortable flying the MQ-9 over terrorists and insurgents that had no means to shoot it down: ""Over time we developed some [tactics, techniques and procedures] that were probably a bit too predictable.” In response, the service is changing the way it flies the MQ-9. Harrigian wants the UAV's flight path to be more ""unpredictable” and remote pilots better informed about where potential threats are located. That may mean being more selective about deployment, and better balancing the value of intelligence against the risk of collecting it. The increase in the number of shoot-downs last year is already having an impact on the UAV manufacturing industry. General Atomics says it is developing the first self-protection pod purpose-built for its UAVs as part of a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement with the US Special Operations Command. The countermeasure device would be compatible with the MQ-9 and the US Army's MQ-1C Gray Eagle, according to a source familiar with the effort. ""Upon completion of the initial prototype and aircraft compatibility testing, Special Operations Forces will evaluate the system's efficacy in detecting and defeating various threats,” says General Atomics. ""The self-protection pod is comprised of a full-complement of mature, fielded aircraft survivability equipment, which will provide full-spectrum protection for the aircraft.” Full-spectrum protection would include infrared countermeasures to confuse heat-seeking missiles or jamming to make it difficult for a missile to be radar guided to its target. The development of a UAV countermeasures pod comes as the US Department of Defense is worried that its larger UAVs are vulnerable to integrated anti-aircraft defences fielded by China and Russia. The USAF plans to make its last purchase of the MQ-9 in fiscal year 2020, according to its FY2021 budget request. In light of Iran's shooting down a Northrop Grumman RQ-4 Global Hawk in June 2019, the service also wants to retire 21 of its 31 examples of that type, particularly older Block 20 and Block 30 variants. And, the USAF on 3 June launched its search for a UAV to replace the MQ-9 starting in 2030. For many years, UAVs capable of armed intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance were predominately operated by three countries: the USA, Israel and the UK, says Drone Wars director Chris Cole. ""But we think there are now at least 15 nations operating these systems,” he says. In the Middle East, China and Turkey are two of the most prominent suppliers. The UAVs produced by these countries are significantly less expensive than those made in the USA. As such, operators of Chinese and Turkish-made aircraft seem more willing to use them assertively. ""Turkey has certainly become almost a superpower, using them not only within its own borders, but also in Syria, and in Libya, and in Iraq as well,” says Cole. In fact, Turkish UAVs are increasingly showing up as burning heaps on different battlefields. Data shows at least 14 Turkish-built unmanned aircraft have been brought down by hostile action since the beginning of 2020. A dozen of those Turkish UAVs shot down were the Baykar Bayraktar. The most commonly used variant of the Bayraktar appears to be the TB2. Ankara has flown that UAV more than 200,000h since its introduction in 2014. And, manufacturer Baykar says it has delivered 110 examples of the TB2 to the Turkish armed forces. The TB2 has a payload of 150kg (331lb) and can carry up to four small laser-guided munitions under its wings. Flight endurance is up to 27h, and operational ceiling is 27,000ft. However, the UAV is not out of the reach of the Russian-made Pantsir-S1, which is apparently to blame for many of the Bayraktar TB2 downings over Libya in 2020. In the Libyan civil war, Russian-backed mercenaries are operating several Pantsir-S1 systems in support of the Libyan National Army, while Turkey is using its armed UAVs to support the internationally recognised Government of National Accord (GNA). A Pantsir S-1 system can hit an aircraft at a maximum range of 10.8nm (20km) and altitude of 32,800ft, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Its pair of 30mm cannons can hit an aircraft 2.2nm away at an altitude of about 10,000ft. It should be no problem for a Pantsir – or a number of other short-range air-defence systems – to hit a UAV, says Riki Ellison, founder of the Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance. ""Those drones are very slow, and easy to target once you see them,” he says. In addition to the Bayraktar TB2s, nine Chinese-built UAVs, mostly Wing-Loong IIs made by China's Chengdu Aircraft Industry Group, are suspected or confirmed to have been shot down in Libya in 2020, according to the data. The United Arab Emirates had been operating Wing-Loong IIs in support of the GNA. Similar scenarios are playing out in Syria and Yemen, where surface-to-air missiles supplied by Iran and Russia have claimed a significant number of downings. With surface-to-air missiles claiming many UAVs, it is no surprise that they have increasingly drawn heavy fire, with reports claiming around two dozen Pantsir-S1 units destroyed recently by retaliatory airstrikes. But UAVs are vulnerable to many types of attacks, says Dan Gettinger, founder of the Center for the Study of the Drone at Bard College in New York. As an example, he cites the growing use of electronic warfare to bring down UAVs. Ultimately, one lesson from the Middle East might be that UAVs should no longer be viewed as precious aircraft of an elite few. ""I often think of Turkey as an example of what the next group of drone operating countries is going to look like. They've built their own industry and they rely on drones quite a lot,” Gettinger says. ""I think the aggressive use of drones instead of manned aircraft in geopolitically sensitive and risky areas is probably what we're going to see more of in future.”",1-Jul-20,"Defence, Department of the Air Force (USAF), Military UAVs, Must Read"

The service is scheduled to receive one example of the upgraded EMARSS-V on 30 June at Sierra Nevada's Hagerstown, Maryland facility, it said on 26 June. ""The modified EMARSS-V aircraft has more powerful engines which allow for better performance at higher elevations and hotter temperatures during take-off,” says Colonel James DeBoer, fixed-wing project manager. ""It also has the ability to operate out of a wider range of airfields because it uses less runway for take-off. A larger fuel capacity allows this aircraft to stay airborne longer for its ISR missions.” The EMARSS-V is based on the commercial Beechcraft King Air 350. It is used to detect, locate, classify, identify and track vehicles and foot soldiers on the ground. That information is relayed to a US Army Brigade Combat Team that could use the information, for example, to coordinate an artillery attack. Aircraft improvements to the prototype upgrade of the EMARSS-V come as part of a mission enhancement kit, which includes better performing Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A-67A turboshaft engines, lighter weight composite propellers, a lighter weight lithium-ion battery and an anti-lock braking system. ""The [mission enhancement kit] reduces aircraft weight while increasing take-off performance in high and hot environments,” says the US Army. ""In addition, the anti-lock braking system reduces take-off field length, which increases the number of suitable airfields where this modernised EMARSS-V can operate.” The service says its current EMARSS aircraft loses 2h of flight time using its current engines in hot and high conditions. The US Army has a fleet of 24 EMARSS of different specialities, including aircraft with signals intelligence and wide-area surveillance equipment. EMARSS-V Electronics upgrades to the EMARSS-V include the addition of anti-jam and anti-spoof GPS and an encrypted Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast system. The US Army finished the EMARSS-V aircraft upgrade and completed the aircraft's final flight testing on 27 May. US Army Contracting Command at Redstone Arsenal in Alabama awarded a $5 million contract to Sierra Nevada in September 2019 to prototype EMARSS-V upgrades. To speed up the process, the service says it used an Other Transaction Authority contract, which allowed it to quickly start prototyping the new aircraft and could allow a future production programme of record to be rapidly established. Other Transaction Authority contracts are popular within the Department of Defense currently as the agreements have less red tape than the typical US government acquisition process.",1-Jul-20,"Defence, Fixed-wing, North America, United States Army"

These cuts will include 5,100 positions in Germany, another 5,000 in France, and 1,700 in the UK. The measures affect subsidiaries including Premium Aerotec – which had already been undergoing a restructuring exercise, affecting 900 jobs, before the crisis – and Stelia. Airbus also intends to cut 900 jobs in Spain and 1,300 from other facilities worldwide. The airframer says the ""necessary reduction” is the subject of consultation processes with social partners, which aim to reach implementation agreements from autumn this year. Airbus states that commercial aircraft activity has fallen by nearly 40% as a result of the coronavirus crisis. It has already slashed single-aisle and twin-aisle production. Airbus has cut production rates for both single-aisle and twin-aisle aircraft But it does not expect air traffic to recover to pre-crisis levels until at least 2023 – and possibly not until 2025. ""Measures we have taken so far have enabled us to absorb the initial shock of this global pandemic,” says Airbus chief Guillaume Faury. ""Now, we must ensure that we can sustain our enterprise and emerge from the crisis as a healthy, global aerospace leader, adjusting to the overwhelming challenges of our customers.” Airbus says the details of the plan still need to be finalised with its workers' representatives. ""While compulsory actions cannot be ruled out at this stage, Airbus will work with its social partners to limit the impact of this plan by relying on all available social measures,” it says. These could include voluntary departures, early retirement, and long-term partial unemployment schemes.",1-Jul-20,"Aerospace, Aircraft programmes, Coronavirus, Europe, Must Read"

Berlin in August 2019 signalled its intention to acquire 31 NH90 NFHs under the Sea Tiger programme to replace an aged fleet of 24 Westland Sea Lynx helicopters; deliveries are due to begin 2024 to match the retirement date of the UK-built rotorcraft. Naval officials have since last year repeatedly stressed the need for a rapid contract signature to meet the ambitious programme timelines. But speaking at a 25 June event to mark the Deutsche Marine's acceptance of its first Sea Lion helicopter – a separate NH90 variant to replace its Sea Kings – Vice Admiral Andreas Krause warned that the Sea Tiger was already lagging. ""Meanwhile, the Sea Tiger casts its shadow as the successor to the Sea Lynx. Unfortunately, we are already behind schedule again here. For the seamless transition we need the Sea Tiger here in 2024.” The navy says ""there is a delay to the procurement process”; negotiations between NHI and NATO helicopter management body NAHEMA are ""ongoing”, with the aim of having ""a contract ready” at the latest ""by the end of the year”; the date of the first delivery ""is part of the negotiations”, it adds. Krause, while welcoming the first of an eventual 18 Sea Lions, notes that a great deal of time has passed since the helicopters were selected in 2013 and there can be no further delays if the Sea Kings are to be retired as planned. Germany's BAAINBw defence procurement agency received the first Sea Lion last October, but insufficient technical documentation and a lack of ground servicing equipment delayed its transfer to the Deutsche Marine. Those problems are now resolved, says the navy, with four helicopters in service and another four due by year-end; deliveries will be complete by mid-2022. Initial operational capability is anticipated in early 2023, with search and rescue activities due to begin by the middle of that year; deployment aboard the navy's Berlin-class support vessels is due in 2024. NHI comprises Airbus Helicopters, Leonardo Helicopters and Fokker; the Sea Lions – and later the Sea Tigers – are assembled by Airbus Helicopters Deutschland in Donauworth in southern Germany.",1-Jul-20,"Defence, Helicopters"
107,https://www.flightglobal.com/safety/pia-banned-from-european-operations-after-mounting-safety-concerns/139069.article,PIA banned from European operations after mounting safety concerns,"Pakistan International Airlines has been blacklisted for a six-month period by European safety regulators, banning it from operating to European Union destinations. The Pakistani flag-carrier has disclosed that the prohibition enters into force on 1 July. It states that it is communicating with the European Union Aviation Safety Agency in order to ""allay their concerns” and hopes that the suspension will soon be ""revoked”. EASA's latest revision of its third-country operator register, dated 24 June, still listed PIA as an approved carrier. The register comprises airlines which have been cleared by EASA to operate services to Europe. PIA had been granted this approval in May 2016. But the carrier and the country's regulatory oversight has come under European safety scrutiny, notably since a PIA ATR 42-500 crash in the Havelian region in December of the same year. PIA has faced scrutiny from European regulators EASA has been concerned over PIA's failure to demonstrate that it has implemented a comprehensive safety-management system. These concerns have since escalated in the aftermath of the fatal Airbus A320 accident at Karachi on 22 May, particularly following the public admission over pilot licensing irregularities. In a communication to the airline, EASA says it understands the country's aviation minister has revealed that over 260 of 860 pilot licences issued by Pakistani regulators, for pilots across a number of Pakistani operators, are ""fraudulent”. ""EASA is concerned about the validity of the Pakistani pilot licences,” it says, adding that it doubts that the Pakistani authorities are ""currently not capable” of certifying and overseeing its operators and aircraft. It adds that the preliminary findings into the A320 accident indicate ""successive breaches of multiple layers of safety defences”. As a result, EASA has informed PIA that it is suspending the airline's third-country operator approval. While PIA claimed to EASA that it had grounded all the pilots on lists compiled by Pakistani authorities, EASA remains unconvinced, stating that the claim ""does not mitigate” its concerns. ""There are strong indications that a high number of Pakistani pilot licences are invalid,” it says. ""EASA therefore no longer has confidence that Pakistan...can effectively ensure that operators certified in Pakistan comply at all times with the applicable requirements for crew qualification.”",1-Jul-20,"Air Transport, Airlines, Asia Pacific, Europe, Ops & safety, Pakistan International Airlines"
