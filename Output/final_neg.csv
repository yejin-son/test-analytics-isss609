"UK budget carrier EasyJet is proposing to close two of its four London bases, as well as its Newcastle station, as part of the cuts to cope with the coronavirus situation. The airline is looking to shut its London Stansted and London Southend bases, along with Newcastle, and to cut nearly 730 pilots and almost 1,300 cabin crew from its workforce. EasyJet stated last month that it was planning “optimisation” of its network and bases, and to reduce its fleet capacity. As a result, it said, it would start consulting employees on reducing staff numbers by up to 30%. EasyJet employed some 15,000 personnel at the end of its 2019 fiscal year, including nearly 4,000 pilots and more than 9,000 cabin crew. But the crisis has forced it to rethink its business plan, and the airline is expecting to fly only about 30% of its planned fourth-quarter capacity – the period covering the peak summer season from July to September. The airline estimates that its fleet at the end of 2021 to total just over 300 aircraft, a figure nearly 15% lower than originally planned. EasyJet has been undertaking steps to defer deliveries of new Airbus jets and raise capital by entering sale-and-leaseback deals. UK cockpit association BALPA states that it is “shocked” at the scale of the crew cuts which, it says, amounts to nearly one in three of its UK pilots. “We had been expecting EasyJet to make an announcement of temporary measures to help the airline through to recovery,” says BALPA general secretary, Brian Strutton. “This seems an excessive over-reaction.” He argues that ticket sales have started to rebound since EasyJet began restoring services, and points out that the airline has been highlighting its strong liquidity. “This is more evidence that aviation in the UK is caught in a death spiral of despair and individual airlines are flailing around without direction,” he adds. EasyJet has bases at London Gatwick and London Luton, as well as other stations in the UK.",6,0,4.0,0.1975,"airport, fleet, service, data, carrier, operation, passenger, number, operate, operator","['uk', 'budget', 'carrier', 'easyjet', 'propose', 'close', 'london', 'base', 'well', 'newcastle', 'station', 'part', 'cut', 'cope', 'coronavirus', 'situation', 'look', 'shut', 'london', 'stansted', 'london', 'southend', 'base', 'along', 'newcastle', 'cut', 'nearly', 'pilot', 'almost', 'cabin', 'crew', 'workforce', 'easyjet', 'state', 'month', 'planning', 'optimisation', 'network', 'base', 'reduce', 'fleet', 'capacity', 'result', 'say', 'start', 'consult', 'employee', 'reduce', 'staff', 'number', 'easyjet', 'employ', 'personnel', 'end', 'fiscal', 'include', 'nearly', 'pilot', 'cabin', 'crew', 'crisis', 'force', 'rethink', 'business', 'plan', 'expect', 'fly', 'plan', 'fourthquarter', 'capacity', 'period', 'cover', 'peak', 'summer', 'season', 'july', 'september', 'estimate', 'fleet', 'end', 'total', 'figure', 'nearly', 'low', 'originally', 'plan', 'easyjet', 'undertaking', 'step', 'defer', 'delivery', 'jet', 'raise', 'capital', 'enter', 'saleandleaseback', 'deal', 'uk', 'cockpit', 'association', 'balpa', 'state', 'shock', 'scale', 'crew', 'cut', 'say', 'amount', 'nearly', 'uk', 'pilot', 'expect', 'easyjet', 'make', 'announcement', 'temporary', 'measure', 'help', 'recovery', 'say', 'balpa', 'general', 'secretary', 'brian', 'strutton', 'seem', 'excessive', 'argues', 'ticket', 'sale', 'start', 'rebound', 'since', 'easyjet', 'begin', 'restore', 'service', 'point', 'highlight', 'strong', 'liquidity', 'evidence', 'uk', 'caught', 'death', 'spiral', 'despair', 'individual', 'flail', 'around', 'without', 'direction', 'add', 'easyjet', 'base', 'london', 'gatwick', 'london', 'luton', 'well', 'station', 'uk']"
"EasyJet's relationship agreement with founder Stelios Haji-Iaonnou has been terminated after his stake in the UK carrier dropped below the 30% threshold. In a 30 June notice to the London Stock Exchange, the airline discloses that “the Haji-Iaonnou family concert party” – comprised of EasyGroup Holdings and Polys Holdings – no longer holds more than 30% of EasyJet's issued share capital following the recent non-pre-emptive placing. “Accordingly, the relationship agreement between the company, EasyGroup and Sir Stelios dated 14 November 2014 (which was put in place to comply with the controlling shareholder regime set out in the listing rules) has terminated in accordance with its terms,” says EasyJet.  The Luton-based low-cost operator raised £419 million ($514 million) on 25 June by placing just under 15% of its share capital through an immediate accelerated bookbuilding process. Termination of the Haji-Iaonnou agreement follows a battle between EasyJet and its founder over an order for 107 Airbus aircraft which he demanded that the carrier cancel or renegotiate. He unsuccessfully sought to remove the airline's chairman, chief executive and chief financial officer plus an independent non-executive director from the board over the dispute.",6,1,8.0,0.3762,"government, uk, carrier, business, state, share, south, airway, financial, plan","['easyjet', 'relationship', 'agreement', 'founder', 'stelios', 'hajiiaonnou', 'terminate', 'stake', 'uk', 'carrier', 'drop', 'threshold', 'june', 'notice', 'london', 'stock', 'exchange', 'discloses', 'hajiiaonnou', 'family', 'concert', 'party', 'comprise', 'easygroup', 'holding', 'polys', 'holding', 'longer', 'hold', 'easyjet', 'issue', 'share', 'capital', 'follow', 'recent', 'nonpreemptive', 'place', 'accordingly', 'relationship', 'agreement', 'easygroup', 'sir', 'stelios', 'date', 'november', 'put', 'place', 'comply', 'control', 'shareholder', 'regime', 'set', 'listing', 'rule', 'terminate', 'accordance', 'term', 'say', 'easyjet', 'lutonbased', 'lowcost', 'operator', 'raise', 'june', 'place', 'share', 'capital', 'immediate', 'accelerate', 'bookbuilding', 'process', 'termination', 'hajiiaonnou', 'agreement', 'follow', 'battle', 'easyjet', 'founder', 'order', 'demand', 'carrier', 'cancel', 'renegotiate', 'unsuccessfully', 'sought', 'remove', 'chairman', 'chief', 'executive', 'chief', 'financial', 'officer', 'plus', 'independent', 'nonexecutive', 'director', 'board', 'dispute']"
"Norwegian has cancelled orders for 97 Boeing aircraft including examples of the troubled 737 Max and the 787 Dreamliner, and is claiming compensation for financial losses related to the two types. The Oslo-based low-cost carrier, which went into self-described “hibernation mode” at the outbreak of the coronavirus crisis three months ago, said on 29 June that it was terminating orders for 92 737 Max and five 787s, as well as the GoldCare service agreements related to the two types. Norwegian cancels Boeing orders, including five 787 Dreamliners “Norwegian has in addition filed a legal claim seeking the return of pre-delivery payments related to the aircraft and compensation for the company's losses related to the grounding of the 737 Max and engine issues on the 787,” the airline states in a Norwegian stock exchange filing. It claims the worldwide grounding of the Max as well as the “long-running reliability issues [of the 787]...resulting in premature and unplanned maintenance which has disrupted the company's operations” have “caused significant losses” for the airline. Norwegian's 787 fleet is powered by Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 engines. The carrier adds that it has been negotiating with Boeing, but that this dialogue has not yet “led to an agreement with a reasonable compensation to the company”. The announcement came on the day that the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) began flight testing the 737 Max with the goal of recertification in the coming weeks. The FAA's first certification flight took place between Seattle's Boeing Field and Moses Lake, Washington, about 120nm (216km) away. The FAA said that it expects the testing to take three days and will include a wide array of flight manoeuvres and emergency procedures to assess whether the changes to the aircraft's automated flight control system meet certification standards. The Max was grounded in March 2019 following two separate accidents which killed 346 passengers and crew. Norwegian, which is currently in a financial restructuring process, said last week that it has begun to reinstate flights as it reopens short-haul European links from Scandinavia following a nearly hundred-day hiatus during which it grounded about 95% of its fleet due to the coronavirus pandemic. The low-cost airline has been operating only a network of 13 domestic routes since the pandemic hit, using just eight aircraft. But it now plans to bring in 12 more aircraft and expand its network to 76 routes across Europe from its Scandinavian hubs beginning next month.",6,2,11.0,0.1531,"pilot, faa, issue, safety, include, report, require, training, ground, order","['norwegian', 'cancel', 'order', 'include', 'example', 'troubled', 'dreamliner', 'claim', 'compensation', 'financial', 'loss', 'related', 'type', 'oslobased', 'lowcost', 'carrier', 'go', 'selfdescribed', 'hibernation', 'mode', 'outbreak', 'coronavirus', 'crisis', 'month', 'ago', 'say', 'june', 'terminate', 'order', 'well', 'goldcare', 'service', 'agreement', 'related', 'type', 'norwegian', 'cancel', 'order', 'include', 'dreamliners', 'norwegian', 'addition', 'file', 'legal', 'claim', 'seek', 'return', 'predelivery', 'payment', 'related', 'compensation', 'loss', 'related', 'ground', 'engine', 'issue', 'state', 'norwegian', 'stock', 'exchange', 'filing', 'claim', 'worldwide', 'ground', 'well', 'longrunning', 'reliability', 'issue', 'result', 'premature', 'unplanned', 'maintenance', 'disrupt', 'operation', 'cause', 'significant', 'loss', 'norwegian', 'fleet', 'power', 'rollsroyce', 'trent', 'engine', 'carrier', 'add', 'negotiate', 'dialogue', 'yet', 'lead', 'agreement', 'reasonable', 'compensation', 'announcement', 'come', 'day', 'u', 'federal', 'administration', 'faa', 'begin', 'test', 'goal', 'recertification', 'come', 'week', 'faa', 'certification', 'take', 'place', 'seattle', 'field', 'moses', 'lake', 'washington', 'away', 'faa', 'say', 'expect', 'test', 'take', 'day', 'include', 'wide', 'array', 'manoeuvre', 'emergency', 'procedure', 'ass', 'whether', 'change', 'automate', 'control', 'system', 'meet', 'certification', 'standard', 'ground', 'march', 'follow', 'separate', 'accident', 'kill', 'passenger', 'crew', 'norwegian', 'currently', 'financial', 'restructuring', 'process', 'say', 'week', 'begin', 'reinstate', 'reopens', 'shorthaul', 'european', 'link', 'scandinavia', 'follow', 'nearly', 'hundredday', 'hiatus', 'ground', 'fleet', 'due', 'coronavirus', 'pandemic', 'lowcost', 'operating', 'network', 'domestic', 'route', 'since', 'pandemic', 'hit', 'use', 'plan', 'bring', 'expand', 'network', 'route', 'across', 'europe', 'scandinavian', 'hub', 'begin', 'next', 'month']"
"Canada's Porter Airlines will restart its operations a month later than previously planned due to ongoing coronavirus-prompted travel restrictions that continue to make business difficult. The Toronto-based regional carrier, which serves 19 destinations in eastern and central Canada as well as the northeastern USA, now says it is aiming to begin flying again by 31 August. “We want to see our planes in the sky as soon as possible and are actively working to prepare for our resumption of service,” the airline says on 28 June. “However, the ongoing uncertainty presented by government travel restrictions, including border closures, is impacting our ability to operate flights. We are closely watching developments and know that Porter will be an important part of providing people with travel options as the economy recovers.” Porter shuttered operations in March as the coronavirus pandemic was beginning to disrupt air traffic around the world. According to Cirium fleets data, the airline operates a fleet of 29 De Havilland Aircraft of Canada Dash 8-400 aircraft and has orders for 12 Airbus A220. Last week, Air Canada chief executive Calin Rovinsecu blasted the Canadian government for maintaining strict lockdown and quarantine requirements more than 100 days into the crisis. The measures, he told shareholders at the company's annual general meeting on 25 June, are “disproportionate”, and hindering the aviation industry's and the country's return to normalcy. “There is growing unease that .... increasingly these broad-brush blanket prohibitions and restrictions are less effectively combating Covid and more inhibiting our economic recovery,” he said. Passenger carriers need to be able to “prudently and cautiously do some business”. In March, Canada banned all non-nationals from entering the country, with few exceptions. All travellers entering Canada by land, sea or air, including citizens, are required to go into a mandatory 14-day quarantine. Even those travelling within the country and between provinces can be subject to requirements that may include self-isolation. The longest peaceful border in the world, between Canada and the United States, has been effectively sealed since 21 March, and the restrictions, extended on 24 June, will continue through at least 21 July.",6,3,12.0,0.3992,"travel, government, country, coronavirus, measure, restriction, passenger, state, march, canada","['canada', 'porter', 'restart', 'operation', 'month', 'later', 'previously', 'plan', 'due', 'ongoing', 'coronavirusprompted', 'travel', 'restriction', 'continue', 'make', 'business', 'difficult', 'torontobased', 'regional', 'carrier', 'serf', 'destination', 'eastern', 'central', 'canada', 'well', 'northeastern', 'usa', 'say', 'aim', 'begin', 'fly', 'august', 'want', 'see', 'plane', 'sky', 'soon', 'possible', 'actively', 'work', 'prepare', 'resumption', 'service', 'say', 'june', 'however', 'ongoing', 'uncertainty', 'present', 'government', 'travel', 'restriction', 'include', 'border', 'closure', 'impact', 'ability', 'operate', 'closely', 'watch', 'development', 'know', 'porter', 'important', 'part', 'provide', 'people', 'travel', 'option', 'economy', 'porter', 'shutter', 'operation', 'march', 'coronavirus', 'pandemic', 'begin', 'disrupt', 'traffic', 'around', 'world', 'accord', 'fleet', 'data', 'operates', 'fleet', 'de', 'havilland', 'canada', 'dash', 'order', 'week', 'canada', 'chief', 'executive', 'calin', 'rovinsecu', 'blast', 'canadian', 'government', 'maintain', 'strict', 'lockdown', 'quarantine', 'requirement', 'day', 'crisis', 'measure', 'told', 'shareholder', 'annual', 'general', 'meeting', 'june', 'disproportionate', 'hinder', 'industry', 'country', 'return', 'normalcy', 'grow', 'unease', 'increasingly', 'broadbrush', 'blanket', 'prohibition', 'restriction', 'less', 'effectively', 'combat', 'covid', 'inhibit', 'economic', 'recovery', 'say', 'passenger', 'carrier', 'need', 'able', 'prudently', 'cautiously', 'business', 'march', 'canada', 'ban', 'nonnationals', 'enter', 'country', 'exception', 'traveller', 'enter', 'canada', 'land', 'sea', 'include', 'citizen', 'require', 'go', 'mandatory', 'quarantine', 'even', 'travel', 'within', 'country', 'province', 'subject', 'requirement', 'may', 'include', 'selfisolation', 'long', 'peaceful', 'border', 'world', 'canada', 'united', 'state', 'effectively', 'seal', 'since', 'march', 'restriction', 'extend', 'june', 'continue', 'least', 'july']"
"The coronavirus crisis will reduce the overall output of carbon emissions from Europe's airlines, but a desire to cut capital expenditure will delay introduction of new aircraft, weakening unit CO2 performance, according to analysis from HSBC. “Prior to the pandemic, all airlines were set to improve their unit emissions performance from 2019 to 2023, thanks to fleet renewal and the optimisation of configurations,” writes the bank, but it adds that, post-Covid-19, “we expect capital expenditure on new aircraft to be lower than previously envisaged, leading to slower improvement in unit emissions”. HSBC notes that the pandemic is prompting the retirement of old, less-efficient aircraft such as Airbus A340s and A380s and Boeing 747s. However, reduced capex levels are likely to delay the retirement of middle-aged aircraft, raising unit levels of CO2.However, the coronavirus crisis may bring other changes that further complicate carriers' emissions. For Europe's three largest airline groups, IAG, Air France-KLM and Lufthansa, HSBC believes that corporate travel will reduce sharply, encouraging them to cut the premium share of seats. The resulting higher density will act to improve per-unit emissions, and could be enough to completely outweigh the impact of slower capex for these carriers. For example, HSBC expects IAG's 2023 emissions per available seat-kilometre to be 86.6g of CO2, against a pre-Covid-19 estimate of 85.2 and the current level of 95.9. But if the carrier pulls back from premium seats, it could be as low as 79.4 by 2023. Out of Europe's three largest low-cost carriers – EasyJet, Ryanair and Wizz Air – EasyJet currently has the highest CO2 emissions per ASK because it operates the smallest aircraft, while Wizz, operating larger A321s, has the lowest. HSBC expect this distinction to increase, as Ryanair and Wizz are both “planning to push on with their fleet development plans” while EasyJet has deferred 24 on-order aircraft. EasyJet's CO2 per ASK is seen declining to 80.8g by 2023 from 82.9g currently, although without the pandemic it would have fallen to 79.3g. Wizz's emissions will reduce from 73.1g to 69.4g and Ryanair's from 81.4g to 78.9g, with both airlines seeing a smaller fall in their per unit emissions than had the pandemic not occurred. Given the impact of the coronavirus on the industry, HSBC expects overall ASKs to be 10-12% lower than they would have been, with the sector as a whole remaining reliant on biofuels and offsetting schemes it if it is to hold emissions to 2019-20 levels, as has been agreed under ICAO's CORSIA programme.",6,4,9.0,0.3144,"industry, crisis, demand, coronavirus, global, iata, market, level, cargo, expect","['coronavirus', 'crisis', 'reduce', 'overall', 'output', 'carbon', 'emission', 'europe', 'desire', 'cut', 'capital', 'expenditure', 'delay', 'introduction', 'weaken', 'unit', 'performance', 'accord', 'analysis', 'hsbc', 'prior', 'pandemic', 'set', 'improve', 'unit', 'emission', 'performance', 'thanks', 'fleet', 'renewal', 'optimisation', 'configuration', 'writes', 'bank', 'add', 'postcoronavirus', 'expect', 'capital', 'expenditure', 'low', 'previously', 'envisage', 'lead', 'slow', 'improvement', 'unit', 'emission', 'hsbc', 'note', 'pandemic', 'prompt', 'retirement', 'old', 'lessefficient', 'however', 'reduce', 'capex', 'level', 'likely', 'delay', 'retirement', 'middleaged', 'raise', 'unit', 'level', 'coronavirus', 'crisis', 'may', 'bring', 'change', 'far', 'complicate', 'carrier', 'emission', 'europe', 'large', 'iag', 'franceklm', 'lufthansa', 'hsbc', 'believe', 'corporate', 'travel', 'reduce', 'sharply', 'encourage', 'cut', 'premium', 'share', 'seat', 'result', 'high', 'density', 'act', 'improve', 'perunit', 'emission', 'enough', 'completely', 'outweigh', 'impact', 'slow', 'capex', 'carrier', 'example', 'hsbc', 'expect', 'iag', 'emission', 'per', 'available', 'seatkilometre', 'precoronavirus', 'estimate', 'current', 'level', 'carrier', 'pull', 'back', 'premium', 'seat', 'low', 'europe', 'large', 'lowcost', 'carrier', 'easyjet', 'ryanair', 'wizz', 'easyjet', 'currently', 'high', 'emission', 'per', 'ask', 'operates', 'small', 'wizz', 'operating', 'large', 'low', 'hsbc', 'expect', 'distinction', 'increase', 'ryanair', 'wizz', 'planning', 'push', 'fleet', 'development', 'plan', 'easyjet', 'defer', 'onorder', 'easyjet', 'per', 'ask', 'see', 'decline', 'currently', 'although', 'without', 'pandemic', 'fall', 'wizz', 'emission', 'reduce', 'ryanair', 'see', 'small', 'fall', 'per', 'unit', 'emission', 'pandemic', 'occur', 'give', 'impact', 'coronavirus', 'industry', 'hsbc', 'expect', 'overall', 'asks', 'low', 'sector', 'whole', 'remain', 'reliant', 'biofuels', 'offset', 'scheme', 'hold', 'emission', 'level', 'agree', 'icao', 'corsia', 'programme']"
"Portuguese maintenance firm OGMA has clashed with accident investigators over conclusions drawn from a serious Embraer 190 incident during which the aircraft departed with cross-rigged aileron cables, almost leading to the loss of the jet. OGMA has strongly objected to several findings from investigation authority GPIAAF, arguing that the inquiry disproportionately assigns responsibility to the maintenance operation. The Air Astana aircraft had taken off from Alverca do Ribatejo air base, bound for Minsk and Almaty, on 11 November 2018 after undergoing scheduled maintenance at OGMA's facilities. But the cross-rigging of the ailerons left the crew struggling to control the jet's attitude, notably in the roll axis. Such was the severity of the situation that, at one point, the pilots sought to head for the sea in order to ditch, before they managed to regain a degree of control and eventually land. The inquiry determined the improper aileron cable installation to be the probable cause of the incident, identifying lack of an effective safety-management system and inadequate independent procedures to detect maintenance escapes. As part of the maintenance work the E190's aileron cables were disconnected, to be re-routed and replaced. But testing was delayed and personnel without relevant experience, who found the maintenance instructions difficult to follow, temporarily reconnected the cables. GPIAAF states that the crossover error went undetected during extensive subsequent troubleshooting and testing. Its inquiry mentions “weaknesses” in the aircraft's design – which had allowed the cables to be inverted – plus flaws in the presentation of the cable routing in maintenance publications, and it points out that the crew had not detected the improper aileron functioning during pre-flight checks. But the conclusions over the maintenance work have triggered a sharp and extensive response from OGMA, running to 14 pages, which recognises that its technicians failed to install the aileron cables properly but which also claims that it is being unjustly singled out. “The message conveyed by the report to any average reader is that only OGMA was at fault and that no other parties had any real contribution for the incident,” it states. “That is inaccurate and incorrect and creates an unfair balance in the report.” OGMA claims it has been “heavily criticised” throughout the inquiry for not having fully implemented a safety-management system, and defends itself by stating that it is “not legally required to do so” – noting that such a measure is still under a rulemaking process, and is not likely to enforce such implementation until around 2022-23 at the earliest. But it adds that it has “already started” implementing a safety-management system, ahead of any legal obligation, for which it says it “should be praised”. “Not being a legal requirement OGMA's [safety-management system] should not be a focus of the report and cannot be deemed to have had any impact whatsoever on the incident,” it says. OGMA has particularly brought up the fact that the aircraft's crew missed the opportunity to detect the maintenance blunder through the routine pre-flight control check. It argues that a maintenance release to service is “not a certificate” for the aircraft's airworthiness and that the operator is the party responsible for ensuring the aircraft is in flying condition – with the crew particularly alert given that the jet had just come out of heavy maintenance. “The aviation industry safety net is established in such way that the pilot-in-command is, by law, the ultimate [person] responsible for the safe operation of the aircraft,” says OGMA. It states that the crew is effectively the “last safety barrier” for preventing an accident. “All things considered, in OGMA's view the crew's failure in detecting the ailerons misconfiguration during the [pre-flight check] is clearly less excusable than the [maintenance company's] failure in detecting the same problem during the maintenance operational checks,” the company says. It accuses the inquiry of “different treatment and assessment” of OGMA's operational checks compared with those of the crew, and that this is “unreasonable and clearly unfair”. OGMA also questions whether sufficient analysis was paid to the crew's handling of the severe flight-control problems, whether the aircraft's flight manual should have addressed the issue, and whether the pilots followed any procedures correctly. Several other matters from the inquiry are brought up in the critique, some of which are “detrimental” to OGMA's reputation, the company insists. Investigation authority GPIAAF says its task is not to assign blame or liability, in line with international standards, but it has included OGMA's comments to “ensure transparency”, even though the inquiry had not sought opinions but rather comments on any factual errors. GPIAAF has largely resisted responding to OGMA's comments, with the exception of a few notes for “clarification” where it believes the company has made “non-supported or biased statements” which were “clearly out of scope” in regards to the consultation process for the draft inquiry report.",6,5,6.0,0.3726,"engine, maintenance, fuel, takeoff, result, failure, system, problem, power, issue","['portuguese', 'maintenance', 'firm', 'ogma', 'clashed', 'accident', 'investigator', 'conclusion', 'drawn', 'serious', 'embraer', 'incident', 'depart', 'crossrigged', 'aileron', 'cable', 'almost', 'lead', 'loss', 'jet', 'ogma', 'strongly', 'object', 'several', 'finding', 'investigation', 'authority', 'gpiaaf', 'argue', 'inquiry', 'disproportionately', 'assigns', 'responsibility', 'maintenance', 'operation', 'astana', 'take', 'alverca', 'ribatejo', 'base', 'bound', 'minsk', 'almaty', 'november', 'undergo', 'schedule', 'maintenance', 'ogma', 'facility', 'crossrigging', 'aileron', 'left', 'crew', 'struggle', 'control', 'jet', 'attitude', 'notably', 'roll', 'axis', 'severity', 'situation', 'point', 'pilot', 'sought', 'head', 'sea', 'order', 'ditch', 'manage', 'regain', 'degree', 'control', 'eventually', 'land', 'inquiry', 'determine', 'improper', 'aileron', 'cable', 'installation', 'probable', 'cause', 'incident', 'identify', 'lack', 'effective', 'safetymanagement', 'system', 'inadequate', 'independent', 'procedure', 'detect', 'maintenance', 'escape', 'part', 'maintenance', 'work', 'aileron', 'cable', 'disconnect', 'rerouted', 'replace', 'test', 'delayed', 'personnel', 'without', 'relevant', 'experience', 'found', 'maintenance', 'instruction', 'difficult', 'follow', 'temporarily', 'reconnected', 'cable', 'gpiaaf', 'state', 'crossover', 'error', 'go', 'undetected', 'extensive', 'subsequent', 'troubleshoot', 'test', 'inquiry', 'mention', 'weakness', 'design', 'allow', 'cable', 'invert', 'plus', 'flaw', 'presentation', 'cable', 'rout', 'maintenance', 'publication', 'point', 'crew', 'detect', 'improper', 'aileron', 'function', 'preflight', 'check', 'conclusion', 'maintenance', 'work', 'trigger', 'sharp', 'extensive', 'response', 'ogma', 'run', 'page', 'recognises', 'technician', 'fail', 'install', 'aileron', 'cable', 'properly', 'claim', 'unjustly', 'single', 'message', 'conveyed', 'report', 'average', 'reader', 'ogma', 'fault', 'party', 'real', 'contribution', 'incident', 'state', 'inaccurate', 'incorrect', 'creates', 'unfair', 'balance', 'ogma', 'claim', 'heavily', 'criticise', 'throughout', 'inquiry', 'fully', 'implement', 'safetymanagement', 'system', 'defends', 'state', 'legally', 'require', 'note', 'measure', 'still', 'rulemaking', 'process', 'likely', 'enforce', 'implementation', 'around', 'early', 'add', 'already', 'start', 'implement', 'safetymanagement', 'system', 'ahead', 'legal', 'obligation', 'say', 'praise', 'legal', 'requirement', 'ogma', 'safetymanagement', 'system', 'focus', 'report', 'deem', 'impact', 'whatsoever', 'incident', 'say', 'ogma', 'particularly', 'brought', 'fact', 'crew', 'miss', 'opportunity', 'detect', 'maintenance', 'blunder', 'routine', 'preflight', 'control', 'check', 'argues', 'maintenance', 'release', 'service', 'certificate', 'airworthiness', 'operator', 'party', 'responsible', 'ensure', 'fly', 'condition', 'crew', 'particularly', 'alert', 'give', 'jet', 'come', 'heavy', 'maintenance', 'industry', 'safety', 'net', 'establish', 'way', 'pilotincommand', 'law', 'ultimate', 'person', 'responsible', 'safe', 'operation', 'say', 'ogma', 'state', 'crew', 'effectively', 'safety', 'barrier', 'prevent', 'accident', 'thing', 'consider', 'ogma', 'view', 'crew', 'failure', 'detect', 'aileron', 'misconfiguration', 'preflight', 'check', 'clearly', 'less', 'excusable', 'maintenance', 'failure', 'detect', 'problem', 'maintenance', 'operational', 'check', 'say', 'accuses', 'inquiry', 'different', 'treatment', 'assessment', 'ogma', 'operational', 'check', 'compare', 'crew', 'unreasonable', 'clearly', 'unfair', 'ogma', 'question', 'whether', 'sufficient', 'analysis', 'paid', 'crew', 'handle', 'severe', 'flightcontrol', 'problem', 'whether', 'manual', 'address', 'issue', 'whether', 'pilot', 'follow', 'procedure', 'correctly', 'several', 'matter', 'inquiry', 'brought', 'critique', 'detrimental', 'ogma', 'reputation', 'insists', 'investigation', 'authority', 'gpiaaf', 'say', 'task', 'assign', 'blame', 'liability', 'line', 'international', 'standard', 'include', 'ogma', 'comment', 'ensure', 'transparency', 'even', 'though', 'inquiry', 'sought', 'opinion', 'rather', 'comment', 'factual', 'error', 'gpiaaf', 'largely', 'resist', 'respond', 'ogma', 'comment', 'exception', 'note', 'clarification', 'believe', 'make', 'nonsupported', 'bias', 'statement', 'clearly', 'scope', 'regard', 'consultation', 'process', 'draft', 'inquiry', 'report']"
"Japanese investigators believe biocide treatment of fuel on a Jetstar Airways Boeing 787-8 led to the aircraft's losing thrust in both engines during a service to Osaka's Kansai airport two days later. The aircraft (VH-VKJ) had departed Cairns on 29 March last year. As it descended through 16,100ft (4,900m) towards Kansai, the crew started to receive instability indications from the right-hand General Electric GEnx-1B engine. These were followed by a failure message for the left-hand engine a few minutes later, at about 11,800ft (3,600m), and then a similar failure message for the right-hand engine. Both messages subsequently disappeared. But the aircraft systems recorded that the left engine had been operating below idle thrust for 8s and the right engine for 81s. As a result of the right engine's unstable performance, the crew disengaged the right-hand autothrottle and set the right-hand thrust lever to 'idle'. The jet landed safely at Kansai about 20min later, and none of the 313 occupants was injured. Japan Transport Safety Board investigators found that an accumulation of magnesium salts had impeded the movement of spools within the engines, destabilising the fuel metering and leading to engine speed oscillations sufficient to dip temporarily below idle. Similar oscillations – not large enough to be detected – had been occurring on the aircraft since it underwent biocide treatment at Auckland two days before the incident. The biocide was introduced by uplifting 25,000kg of fuel to the centre tank, plus 4,000kg to the left wing tank and 3,500kg to the right wing tank. Owing to differing quantities of residual fuel already present in each wing tank, the concentration of biocide for this additionally-uplifted fuel had to be individually calculated in order to achieve the 100ppm required. The inquiry says a concentration of 250ppm was needed for the left tank and 285ppm for the right. But it says there was “no record” of the actual calculation made, or the dosage used, during the treatment. “It is desirable to keep these records because they are considered to be important for traceability of maintenance work,” it points out. The investigators also believe that the added fuel, with the higher biocide concentrations, “did not mix evenly” with the residual fuel in the tanks before being fed to the engines. This failure to achieve even distribution could have been influenced by fuel temperature and density, as well as the interior structure of the tanks, but the inquiry could not determine how much of the fuel was not mixed. All three fuel tanks were treated with Kathon FP 1.5, a biocide which has since been withdrawn from aviation use following other engine thrust incidents.",6,6,6.0,0.4829,"engine, maintenance, fuel, takeoff, result, failure, system, problem, power, issue","['japanese', 'investigator', 'believe', 'biocide', 'treatment', 'fuel', 'jetstar', 'airway', 'lead', 'lose', 'thrust', 'engine', 'service', 'osaka', 'kansai', 'airport', 'day', 'later', 'vhvkj', 'depart', 'cairn', 'march', 'descend', 'towards', 'kansai', 'crew', 'start', 'receive', 'instability', 'indication', 'righthand', 'general', 'electric', 'engine', 'follow', 'failure', 'message', 'lefthand', 'engine', 'minute', 'later', 'similar', 'failure', 'message', 'righthand', 'engine', 'message', 'subsequently', 'disappear', 'system', 'record', 'left', 'engine', 'operating', 'idle', 'thrust', 'right', 'engine', 'result', 'right', 'engine', 'unstable', 'performance', 'crew', 'disengage', 'righthand', 'autothrottle', 'set', 'righthand', 'thrust', 'lever', 'jet', 'land', 'safely', 'kansai', 'later', 'none', 'occupant', 'injured', 'japan', 'transport', 'safety', 'board', 'investigator', 'found', 'accumulation', 'magnesium', 'salt', 'impede', 'movement', 'spool', 'within', 'engine', 'destabilise', 'fuel', 'meter', 'lead', 'engine', 'speed', 'oscillation', 'sufficient', 'dip', 'temporarily', 'idle', 'similar', 'oscillation', 'large', 'enough', 'detect', 'occur', 'since', 'underwent', 'biocide', 'treatment', 'auckland', 'day', 'incident', 'biocide', 'introduce', 'uplift', 'fuel', 'centre', 'tank', 'plus', 'left', 'wing', 'tank', 'right', 'wing', 'tank', 'owe', 'differ', 'quantity', 'residual', 'fuel', 'already', 'present', 'wing', 'tank', 'concentration', 'biocide', 'additionallyuplifted', 'fuel', 'individually', 'calculate', 'order', 'achieve', 'require', 'inquiry', 'say', 'concentration', 'need', 'left', 'tank', 'right', 'say', 'record', 'actual', 'calculation', 'make', 'dosage', 'use', 'treatment', 'desirable', 'keep', 'record', 'consider', 'important', 'traceability', 'maintenance', 'work', 'point', 'investigator', 'believe', 'add', 'fuel', 'high', 'biocide', 'concentration', 'mix', 'evenly', 'residual', 'fuel', 'tank', 'fed', 'engine', 'failure', 'achieve', 'even', 'distribution', 'influence', 'fuel', 'temperature', 'density', 'well', 'interior', 'structure', 'tank', 'inquiry', 'determine', 'much', 'fuel', 'mixed', 'fuel', 'tank', 'treat', 'kathon', 'fp', 'biocide', 'since', 'withdrawn', 'use', 'follow', 'engine', 'thrust', 'incident']"
"Air New Zealand's May traffic statistics continue to highlight the extreme weakness confronting airlines amid the coronavirus pandemic. For the entire month, the airline carried just 67,000 passengers, down 94.8% from 1.3 million passengers in May 2019. ASKs fell 92.8% year on year and RPKs 97.1%. The airline's load factor in the month was 34.2%, down 50 percentage points from a year earlier. The weakness in the airline's network was evident across all segments. Traffic to Asia was particularly dismal, with 1,000 passengers carried on Asian segments, down 98.9% from a year earlier. Air NZ's domestic flights, while carrying over 90% few passengers this year, were able to generate a load factor of 49%, considerably greater than any other segment. On 18 June, Air NZ said it would report an underlying loss of up to NZ$120 million ($77 million) for the year ending 30 June. Separately, on 26 June Australia's Perth Airport said that passenger numbers for May were 99% down from May 2019, with interstate passengers down 97%. “The aviation sector was the first to be impacted by the coronavirus virus and it's had a massive impact,” says Perth airport chief executive Kevin Brown. “Airports, airlines and the myriad of companies that provide aviation support services have all suffered catastrophic losses of business and revenue and many people's jobs have been directly impacted.”",6,7,3.0,0.3227,"passenger, loss, operating, revenue, traffic, month, increase, capacity, decline, result","['zealand', 'may', 'traffic', 'statistic', 'continue', 'highlight', 'extreme', 'weakness', 'confront', 'amid', 'coronavirus', 'pandemic', 'entire', 'month', 'carry', 'passenger', 'passenger', 'may', 'asks', 'fell', 'rpks', 'load', 'factor', 'month', 'percentage', 'point', 'earlier', 'weakness', 'network', 'evident', 'across', 'segment', 'traffic', 'asia', 'particularly', 'dismal', 'passenger', 'carry', 'asian', 'segment', 'earlier', 'nz', 'domestic', 'carry', 'passenger', 'able', 'generate', 'load', 'factor', 'considerably', 'great', 'segment', 'june', 'nz', 'say', 'report', 'underlie', 'loss', 'nz', 'end', 'june', 'separately', 'june', 'australia', 'perth', 'airport', 'say', 'passenger', 'number', 'may', 'may', 'interstate', 'passenger', 'sector', 'impact', 'coronavirus', 'virus', 'massive', 'impact', 'say', 'perth', 'airport', 'chief', 'executive', 'kevin', 'brown', 'airport', 'myriad', 'provide', 'support', 'service', 'suffer', 'catastrophic', 'loss', 'business', 'revenue', 'many', 'people', 'job', 'directly', 'impact']"
"British Airways has taken delivery of its first Boeing 787-10, almost six months later than originally scheduled. The airline has orders for 12 of the stretched variant and had originally been expecting to receive the first -10 in January. The initial aircraft (G-ZBLA) made its first flight from Boeing's Charleston, South Carolina plant in January and FlightGlobal understands that several delivery targets were missed. The aircraft was finally ferried to BA's London Heathrow base overnight on 27-28 June, arriving at around 11:45. The airline is configuring its Rolls-Royce Trent 1000-powered 787-10s with 256 seats in four classes. The cabin layout comprises eight seats in first class, a 48-seat business cabin, 35 seats in premium economy and 165 in economy. In November last year, BA stated the twinjet's initial route would be between London and Atlanta. BA declines to provide any details the latest plan for the variant's service debut. The original schedule called for six 787-10s to be delivered during 2020, although the current plan in the wake of the delivery delay and any possible impact from the coronavirus crisis, is not confirmed. This largest variant of the 787 joins BA's existing fleet of 30 787-8/9s, which includes 12 -8s and 18 -9s.

"Confusion and loss of situational awareness during a procedural approach to Bergerac resulted in a Ryanair Boeing 737-800 descending to less than 800ft above ground while still 8nm from the airport's runway, French investigators have determined. The crew of the aircraft – arriving from London Stansted on 29 January 2015 – had been offered a satellite-based area navigation approach, as both the ILS and DME navigation aids were unavailable. But the crew believed they were not authorised for a satellite-based approach and opted instead for a timed NDB procedural approach. For the southbound aircraft, this involved passing the Bergerac NDB beacon – situated to the east of runway 28 – at 2,500ft and then turning left to track eastbound for about 1min 30s, before making a left-hand 180° turn to align with the runway. Once this alignment was performed, the aircraft would descend from 2,500ft on final approach. French investigation authority BEA says the pilots were instructed to follow an NDB Y approach, but indicates that the crew had not expected this particular procedure, because they subsequently had to reprogram the flight-management system. Although the first officer believed the NDB Y procedure had previously been correctly selected, the reprogramming suggests it was not, says the inquiry. Either way, BEA says the reprogramming “did not satisfy” the captain, who chose to conduct the approach using the aircraft's 'heading' and 'vertical speed' modes. But it notes that the aircraft was left in 'LNAV' mode which, it says, “appears contrary” to the captain's decision. Cockpit-voice recorder information, which might have explained the reasoning, was unavailable. The aircraft passed the Bergerac NDB at 2,723ft on a heading of 213°, descending towards the 2,500ft selected altitude, before entering a left turn to 097°. But the aircraft, shortly afterwards, commenced an early left turn which, says BEA, appears to correspond more to entering the holding pattern rather than the later turn for the NDB Y approach. As it entered the turn, the captain instructed a reduction of altitude and the first officer selected an altitude of 900ft, as well as descent rate of 900ft/min and then 1,200ft/min. BEA believes the premature descent – below the required 2,500ft – resulted from the impression that the left turn would have left the aircraft too high for the final approach. As the aircraft descended in its continuing left turn the first officer gradually eased the descent rate back to 300ft/min. The crew declared they were established “inbound” while still on a heading of 340°, some 65° off the final approach heading, and descending through 1,447ft. As the flight was handed from Aquitaine approach control to Bergerac tower, a minimum safe altitude alarm alerted the approach controller. The aircraft had reached 1,240ft when the crew contacted the tower. Less than 25s later a terrain warning sounded in the cockpit. The aircraft, still 8nm from the runway, was descending through 1,054ft, with its LNAV and 'altitude acquisition' autopilot modes active. BEA states that the engagement of 'altitude acquisition' had led the aircraft's descent rate to increase substantially, to some 970ft/min. The crew commanded go-around thrust, as the 737 dipped below a height of 800ft above ground and the ground-proximity warning system issued a 'pull up' order. Investigators state that the aircraft had been descending for nearly 2min while below the minimum altitude, adding that the crew probably had no visual references owing to the instrument meteorological conditions present. The aircraft climbed to 4,000ft and subsequently conducted another NDB Y approach to runway 28, where it landed without further incident. None of the 172 occupants was injured. BEA says that, although the crew believed they were prepared for the first approach, the preparation was “probably incomplete or imprecise”. The belated modification of the approach plan, including the reprogramming of the flight-management system, left the crew unable to reach a consensus on the guidance mode to be used. “This resulted in confusion on the part of the captain as to the horizontal trajectory actually followed by the aircraft,” it adds, pointing out that the first officer was also inexperienced on the captain's choice of approach. Rather than opting for a holding circuit or reverting to basic procedural control, the captain requested an early descent, leading to the low-altitude approach.",6,9,7.0,0.6768,"crew, runway, inquiry, land, approach, accident, investigator, captain, incident, pilot","['confusion', 'loss', 'situational', 'awareness', 'procedural', 'approach', 'bergerac', 'result', 'ryanair', 'descend', 'less', 'ground', 'still', 'airport', 'runway', 'french', 'investigator', 'determine', 'crew', 'arrive', 'london', 'stansted', 'january', 'offer', 'satellitebased', 'area', 'navigation', 'approach', 'il', 'dme', 'navigation', 'aid', 'unavailable', 'crew', 'believe', 'authorise', 'satellitebased', 'approach', 'opt', 'instead', 'ndb', 'procedural', 'approach', 'southbound', 'involve', 'passing', 'bergerac', 'ndb', 'beacon', 'situate', 'east', 'runway', 'turn', 'left', 'track', 'eastbound', 'make', 'lefthand', 'turn', 'align', 'runway', 'alignment', 'perform', 'descend', 'final', 'approach', 'french', 'investigation', 'authority', 'bea', 'say', 'pilot', 'instruct', 'follow', 'ndb', 'approach', 'indicates', 'crew', 'expect', 'particular', 'procedure', 'subsequently', 'reprogram', 'flightmanagement', 'system', 'although', 'officer', 'believe', 'ndb', 'procedure', 'previously', 'correctly', 'select', 'reprogramming', 'suggests', 'say', 'inquiry', 'either', 'way', 'bea', 'say', 'reprogramming', 'satisfy', 'captain', 'chose', 'conduct', 'approach', 'use', 'speed', 'mode', 'note', 'left', 'mode', 'say', 'appear', 'contrary', 'captain', 'decision', 'cockpitvoice', 'recorder', 'information', 'might', 'explain', 'reason', 'unavailable', 'pass', 'bergerac', 'ndb', 'head', 'descend', 'towards', 'select', 'altitude', 'enter', 'left', 'turn', 'shortly', 'afterwards', 'commenced', 'early', 'left', 'turn', 'say', 'bea', 'appear', 'correspond', 'enter', 'hold', 'pattern', 'rather', 'later', 'turn', 'ndb', 'approach', 'enter', 'turn', 'captain', 'instruct', 'reduction', 'altitude', 'officer', 'select', 'altitude', 'well', 'descent', 'rate', 'bea', 'believe', 'premature', 'descent', 'require', 'result', 'impression', 'left', 'turn', 'left', 'high', 'final', 'approach', 'descend', 'continue', 'left', 'turn', 'officer', 'gradually', 'ease', 'descent', 'rate', 'back', 'crew', 'declare', 'establish', 'inbound', 'still', 'head', 'final', 'approach', 'head', 'descend', 'hand', 'aquitaine', 'approach', 'control', 'bergerac', 'tower', 'minimum', 'safe', 'altitude', 'alarm', 'alert', 'approach', 'controller', 'reach', 'crew', 'contact', 'tower', 'less', 'later', 'terrain', 'warn', 'sound', 'cockpit', 'still', 'runway', 'descend', 'lnav', 'acquisition', 'autopilot', 'mode', 'active', 'bea', 'state', 'engagement', 'acquisition', 'lead', 'descent', 'rate', 'increase', 'substantially', 'crew', 'command', 'goaround', 'thrust', 'dipped', 'height', 'ground', 'groundproximity', 'warn', 'system', 'issue', 'order', 'investigator', 'state', 'descend', 'nearly', 'minimum', 'altitude', 'add', 'crew', 'probably', 'visual', 'reference', 'owe', 'instrument', 'meteorological', 'condition', 'present', 'climbed', 'subsequently', 'conduct', 'another', 'ndb', 'approach', 'runway', 'land', 'without', 'far', 'incident', 'none', 'occupant', 'injured', 'bea', 'say', 'although', 'crew', 'believe', 'prepared', 'approach', 'preparation', 'probably', 'incomplete', 'imprecise', 'belated', 'modification', 'approach', 'plan', 'include', 'reprogramming', 'flightmanagement', 'system', 'left', 'crew', 'unable', 'reach', 'consensus', 'guidance', 'mode', 'use', 'result', 'confusion', 'part', 'captain', 'horizontal', 'trajectory', 'actually', 'follow', 'add', 'point', 'officer', 'inexperienced', 'captain', 'choice', 'approach', 'rather', 'opt', 'hold', 'circuit', 'revert', 'basic', 'procedural', 'control', 'captain', 'request', 'early', 'descent', 'lead', 'lowaltitude', 'approach']"

"United Airlines will resume flights between the US and several destinations in Asia next month. The Chicago-based airline says its twice-weekly San Francisco-to-Shanghai connection via Seoul will return on 8 July. The airline will operate a Boeing 777 on the route. Later in the month, the carrier will reinstate service between Chicago and Tokyo, restart service to Hong Kong and fly to Singapore via a stop at Hong Kong. “Resuming service to Shanghai from the United States is a significant step in rebuilding our international network,” says Patrick Quayle, United's vice-president of international network and alliances on 26 June. United says that prior to suspending service to Shanghai in February due to the coronavirus crisis, it was the largest US carrier serving China, operating five daily flights between Shanghai and hubs in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago and Newark. The announcement comes just days after competitor Delta Air Lines said it was resuming flights between the countries this week after a regulatory spat threatened to keep flights suspended indefinitely. Shortly after the coronavirus crisis had been deemed a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March, China restricted inbound international flights – a bid to stem the number of imported cases. That order prohibited carriers from adding more capacity than they had in schedules on 12 March – a date on which US airlines had no China flights. In May, Delta and United applied to the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) for authority to resume passenger flights between the two countries as cases waned, but he CAAC denied their requests. On 3 June, the US Department of Transportation (DOT) responded by blocking Chinese airlines from flying to the USA from mid-June. But the CAAC soon relented, allowing US carriers to fly a combined four weekly flights to mainland China, according to the US DOT.

"Operators of Rolls-Royce-powered Boeing 787s are being warned over unanticipated fuel-pump deterioration, particularly on high-life Trent 1000 engines, and instructed to replace the parts earlier. While the issue had originally been thought to affect pumps with a specific part number, Rolls-Royce has developed a service bulletin which extends to additional pumps. As a result the European Union Aviation Safety Agency has broadened the applicability of a proposed directive from three to 19 variants of the Trent 1000. EASA says an “unexpected reduction” in fuel-pump performance has been recorded during testing of high-life units, caused by wearing-out of internal components. This loss of fuel-pump efficiency is “more pronounced” on higher-rated engines, it says, and could result in reduced engine thrust. As a result the life limit of the pumps has been reduced and EASA is ordering operators to replace them before this revised limit – depending on the engine model – is exceeded. EASA rejected a suggestion from British Airways to de-pair affected engines British Airways, which has 30 787-8s and -9s, had expressed concern, after the issue was initially raised, that older pumps with deteriorated fuel flow might not be able to sustain maximum continuous thrust, and therefore might not be able to achieve minimum standards for extended twin-engined operations (ETOPS). With maintenance capabilities restricted by reduced personnel and measures in response to the coronavirus crisis, as well as challenges for suppliers to meet the demand for suitable pumps, the airline had indicated that compliance deadlines to replace some high-life pumps could be difficult to meet. But EASA denied British Airways' request to use engine de-pairing as a strategy to extend the compliance time. EASA points out that the risk associated with the pump degradation does not apply only to aircraft which have both pumps above life limit, because an aircraft with a single high-life pump could be left operating with degraded performance should the other engine fail – irrespective of the state of its pump. “Although EASA concurs that an [aircraft] with a single pump above threshold carries less risk than [one] with dual pumps above threshold, this risk remains unacceptable,” it states.",6,13,6.0,0.4383,"engine, maintenance, fuel, takeoff, result, failure, system, problem, power, issue","['operator', 'rollsroycepowered', 'warn', 'unanticipated', 'fuelpump', 'deterioration', 'particularly', 'highlife', 'trent', 'engine', 'instruct', 'replace', 'part', 'earlier', 'issue', 'originally', 'thought', 'affect', 'pump', 'specific', 'part', 'number', 'rollsroyce', 'developed', 'service', 'bulletin', 'extends', 'additional', 'pump', 'result', 'european', 'union', 'safety', 'agency', 'broaden', 'applicability', 'propose', 'directive', 'variant', 'trent', 'easa', 'say', 'unexpected', 'reduction', 'fuelpump', 'performance', 'record', 'test', 'highlife', 'unit', 'cause', 'wearingout', 'internal', 'component', 'loss', 'fuelpump', 'efficiency', 'pronounce', 'higherrated', 'engine', 'say', 'result', 'reduce', 'engine', 'thrust', 'result', 'life', 'limit', 'pump', 'reduce', 'easa', 'order', 'operator', 'replace', 'revise', 'limit', 'depend', 'engine', 'model', 'exceed', 'easa', 'reject', 'suggestion', 'british', 'airway', 'depair', 'affected', 'engine', 'british', 'airway', 'express', 'concern', 'issue', 'initially', 'raise', 'old', 'pump', 'deteriorate', 'fuel', 'flow', 'might', 'able', 'sustain', 'maximum', 'continuous', 'thrust', 'therefore', 'might', 'able', 'achieve', 'minimum', 'standard', 'extend', 'twinengined', 'operation', 'etops', 'maintenance', 'capability', 'restrict', 'reduce', 'personnel', 'measure', 'response', 'coronavirus', 'crisis', 'well', 'challenge', 'supplier', 'meet', 'demand', 'suitable', 'pump', 'indicate', 'compliance', 'deadline', 'replace', 'highlife', 'pump', 'difficult', 'meet', 'easa', 'deny', 'british', 'airway', 'request', 'use', 'engine', 'depairing', 'strategy', 'extend', 'compliance', 'easa', 'point', 'risk', 'associate', 'pump', 'degradation', 'apply', 'pump', 'life', 'limit', 'single', 'highlife', 'pump', 'left', 'operating', 'degrade', 'performance', 'engine', 'fail', 'irrespective', 'state', 'pump', 'although', 'easa', 'concurs', 'single', 'pump', 'threshold', 'carry', 'less', 'risk', 'dual', 'pump', 'threshold', 'risk', 'remains', 'unacceptable', 'state']"
"Decisions on the future of South African Airways have been pushed back by nearly three weeks, after three unions secured an adjournment of a crucial creditor meeting, in order to buy time to adjust the business rescue plan. The SAAPA, SACCA and NUMSA unions – representing pilots, cabin crew, and other SAA workers – secured support for an adjournment to 14 July, with 69% of the vote in favour of the postponement. These unions have asked for the business plan to be revised, to address “deficiencies”, and republished by 7 July – some seven months after the initiation of business rescue – according to minutes disclosed by SAA's rescue practitioners. These revisions would aim to include fewer conditions while providing “greater certainty for affected persons”. The unions also reasoned that an adjournment would provide creditors with additional time to review the amended plan, potentially offering “many positive effects” while not affecting the position of the airline, given that the original business plan would not have come into effect until 15 July. Postponement of the vote prolongs the uncertainty over SAA's future, following multiple disruptions to the long-running business rescue scheme, including union objections, parliamentary intervention, and the impact of the coronavirus crisis. On the eve of the 25 June creditor meeting, South African regional carrier Airlink made a bid to have SAA liquidated. In an answering affidavit to the Gauteng high court in Johannesburg, the government's department of public enterprises – the owner of SAA – criticised the “last-minute” intervention by Airlink. Airlink's urgent request for SAA's liquidation, it added, needed to be seen in the context of Airlink's being a competitor to SAA. “Its incentive is not simply to get payment of a creditor's claim,” it said, pointing out that Airlink's position would be “substantially improved” without SAA and, potentially, its subsidiary Mango. The court agreed with SAA's representatives and chose to “strike off the roll” the Airlink application, states the department of public enterprises, with the judge ruling that it was “not urgent”. But while the department had hoped, after the ruling, that there would be “no further delay” to the creditor vote, the passing of the union motion during the 25 June meeting keeps SAA in limbo until mid-July at least.",6,14,8.0,0.4805,"government, uk, carrier, business, state, share, south, airway, financial, plan","['decision', 'future', 'south', 'african', 'airway', 'push', 'back', 'nearly', 'week', 'union', 'secure', 'adjournment', 'crucial', 'creditor', 'meeting', 'order', 'buy', 'adjust', 'business', 'rescue', 'plan', 'saapa', 'sacca', 'numsa', 'union', 'represent', 'pilot', 'cabin', 'crew', 'saa', 'worker', 'secure', 'support', 'adjournment', 'july', 'vote', 'favour', 'postponement', 'union', 'ask', 'business', 'plan', 'revise', 'address', 'deficiency', 'republish', 'july', 'month', 'initiation', 'business', 'rescue', 'accord', 'minute', 'disclose', 'saa', 'rescue', 'practitioner', 'revision', 'aim', 'include', 'condition', 'provide', 'great', 'certainty', 'affected', 'person', 'union', 'reason', 'adjournment', 'provide', 'creditor', 'additional', 'review', 'amend', 'plan', 'potentially', 'offering', 'many', 'positive', 'effect', 'affect', 'position', 'give', 'original', 'business', 'plan', 'come', 'effect', 'july', 'postponement', 'vote', 'prolongs', 'uncertainty', 'saa', 'future', 'follow', 'multiple', 'disruption', 'longrunning', 'business', 'rescue', 'scheme', 'include', 'union', 'objection', 'parliamentary', 'intervention', 'impact', 'coronavirus', 'crisis', 'eve', 'june', 'creditor', 'meeting', 'south', 'african', 'regional', 'carrier', 'airlink', 'make', 'bid', 'saa', 'liquidate', 'answer', 'affidavit', 'gauteng', 'high', 'court', 'johannesburg', 'government', 'department', 'public', 'enterprise', 'owner', 'saa', 'criticise', 'lastminute', 'intervention', 'airlink', 'airlink', 'urgent', 'request', 'saa', 'liquidation', 'add', 'need', 'see', 'context', 'airlink', 'competitor', 'saa', 'incentive', 'simply', 'get', 'payment', 'creditor', 'claim', 'say', 'point', 'airlink', 'position', 'substantially', 'improve', 'without', 'saa', 'potentially', 'subsidiary', 'mango', 'court', 'agree', 'saa', 'representative', 'chose', 'strike', 'roll', 'airlink', 'application', 'state', 'department', 'public', 'enterprise', 'judge', 'ruling', 'urgent', 'department', 'hop', 'ruling', 'far', 'delay', 'creditor', 'vote', 'passing', 'union', 'motion', 'june', 'meeting', 'keep', 'saa', 'limbo', 'midjuly', 'least']"
"Singapore Airlines has confirmed that it is taking back Boeing 777-200s it is leasing to joint venture airline NokScoot. NokScoot said on 24 June that it will return three aircraft to their lessor by the end of June, as part of a rationalisation of its business amid the pressures of the Covid-19 pandemic. It is also making an unspecified number of staff redundant. “We are progressively taking back aircraft leased to NokScoot. This is because NokScoot does not have the ability to make lease payments,” Singapore Airlines tells Cirium. “The future of NokScoot is a matter under discussion by all shareholders.” Cirium fleets data show NokScoot operates a fleet of seven Boeing 777-200s and owns all the aircraft.

"Air Canada's chief executive Calin Rovinescu has excoriated the government of Canada for maintaining coronavirus-prompted travel restrictions he says are hindering the air transport industry's ability to return to any semblance of normalcy. Speaking at the company's annual shareholder meeting on 25 June, held virtually, Rovinescu questioned why the government of Canada is “continuing with these broad and indiscriminate measures” that are “disproportionate [and] out of step with other countries”. The measures remain in place some four months into a crisis that grounded much of global air travel earlier this year. “In imposing comprehensive, blanket quarantine and other travel restrictions, our government effectively deployed its emergency powers. And, at the time, broad-brush, immediate blanket prohibitions may well have been necessary, having been introduced at the peak of the crisis,” Rovinescu says. “Now, more than 100 days later, aviation in our country is still largely closed and an enormous amount of people in Canada are severely impacted.” “Our government needs to act reasonably in discharging its broad powers. They do need to consider alternatives that achieve the public health objectives in a way that minimises damage to the economic and social well-being of Canadians and apply objective, evidence-based measures that carefully balance the many competing interests and other rights at play, especially as the curve has flattened,” he adds. Rovinescu says the Montreal-based airline has taken “decisive measures” to mitigate the financial impact of the virus by introducing comprehensive cost cuts. It has been able to reduce cash burn to C$22 million ($16 million) per day. Load factors early in the pandemic fell to between 3-5%. In the meantime the carrier has laid off more than 50% of its pre-coronavirus 40,000-strong workforce and sent 79 jets into early retirement. Air Canada was also the first to cancel some orders for the beleaguered Boeing 737 Max, which has been grounded since March 2019. In past weeks, the airline was successful in raising more than C$5.5 billion to assist its liquidity issues, Rovinescu adds. But now is time for both the federal and the provincial governments to lift blanket travel bans and quarantine requirements so that airlines and the tourism sector can get back to work, he says. “There is growing unease that as we have flattened the curve in Canada and in other countries, increasingly these broad-brush blanket prohibitions and restrictions are less effectively combating Covid and more inhibiting our economic recovery,” he says. In March, Canada banned all non-nationals from entering the country, with few exceptions. All travellers entering Canada by land, sea or air, including citizens, are required to go into a mandatory 14-day quarantine. Those found violating the restrictions can be subject to a fine of C$750,000, six months in jail and expulsion from the country. Even those travelling within the country and between provinces can be subject to requirements that may include self-isolations. The longest peaceful border in the world, between Canada and the United States, has been effectively sealed since 21 March, and the restrictions, extended on 24 June, will continue through at least 21 July. “Covid-19 has upended everything [and] painfully unwound a decade of profitable growth” for the airline, Rovinescu says. The opening of air travel in a “smart and measured way” is important not only for leisure travel, but also because the sector is critical to the entire Canadian economy, Rovinescu says. He called on the government to use a “science-based approach”, as other countries have. “We are now entering a new phase, one in which we must find a responsible way to co-exist with Covid-19 until there is a vaccine.” “We need to be permitted to prudently and cautiously do some business in the same way airlines in other countries are,” he tells shareholders. “The federal and provincial governments, as a matter of urgency, need to find a thoughtful way to achieve the vital public health objectives in a way that allows for the prudent opening of aviation and lifting of restrictions to safely resume some level of travel.” The pandemic's effects also threaten to upend Air Canada's planned takeover of holiday specialist Transat AT. The transaction, overwhelmingly approved by Transat's shareholders in August 2019, was due to close in the middle of 2020. However, it continues to be under scrutiny from various regulatory agencies, including the European Commission and Canada's competition watchdog. Unconfirmed reports in Canada's French-language media earlier this month claimed Air Canada was searching for a way to exit the deal due to liquidity issues. On 24 June, Air Canada's Calgary-based competitor WestJet, the nation's second-largest airline, said it was eliminating more than 3,000 jobs by consolidating and outsourcing services such as call centres and airport operations as it seeks to reduce costs.",6,16,12.0,0.5006,"travel, government, country, coronavirus, measure, restriction, passenger, state, march, canada","['canada', 'chief', 'executive', 'calin', 'rovinescu', 'excoriate', 'government', 'canada', 'maintain', 'coronavirusprompted', 'travel', 'restriction', 'say', 'hinder', 'transport', 'industry', 'ability', 'return', 'semblance', 'normalcy', 'speak', 'annual', 'shareholder', 'meeting', 'june', 'held', 'virtually', 'rovinescu', 'question', 'government', 'canada', 'continue', 'broad', 'indiscriminate', 'measure', 'disproportionate', 'step', 'country', 'measure', 'remain', 'place', 'month', 'crisis', 'ground', 'much', 'global', 'travel', 'earlier', 'impose', 'comprehensive', 'blanket', 'quarantine', 'travel', 'restriction', 'government', 'effectively', 'deployed', 'emergency', 'power', 'broadbrush', 'immediate', 'blanket', 'prohibition', 'may', 'well', 'necessary', 'introduce', 'peak', 'crisis', 'rovinescu', 'say', 'day', 'later', 'country', 'still', 'largely', 'close', 'enormous', 'amount', 'people', 'canada', 'severely', 'government', 'need', 'act', 'reasonably', 'discharge', 'broad', 'power', 'need', 'consider', 'alternative', 'achieve', 'public', 'health', 'objective', 'way', 'minimises', 'damage', 'economic', 'social', 'wellbeing', 'canadian', 'apply', 'objective', 'evidencebased', 'measure', 'carefully', 'balance', 'many', 'compete', 'interest', 'right', 'play', 'especially', 'curve', 'flatten', 'add', 'rovinescu', 'say', 'montrealbased', 'take', 'decisive', 'measure', 'mitigate', 'financial', 'impact', 'virus', 'introduce', 'comprehensive', 'cost', 'cut', 'able', 'reduce', 'cash', 'burn', 'c', 'per', 'day', 'load', 'factor', 'early', 'pandemic', 'fell', 'meantime', 'carrier', 'laid', 'precoronavirus', 'workforce', 'sent', 'jet', 'early', 'retirement', 'canada', 'cancel', 'order', 'beleaguer', 'ground', 'since', 'march', 'past', 'week', 'successful', 'raise', 'c', 'assist', 'liquidity', 'issue', 'rovinescu', 'add', 'federal', 'provincial', 'government', 'lift', 'blanket', 'travel', 'ban', 'quarantine', 'requirement', 'tourism', 'sector', 'get', 'back', 'work', 'say', 'grow', 'unease', 'flatten', 'curve', 'canada', 'country', 'increasingly', 'broadbrush', 'blanket', 'prohibition', 'restriction', 'less', 'effectively', 'combat', 'covid', 'inhibit', 'economic', 'recovery', 'say', 'march', 'canada', 'ban', 'nonnationals', 'enter', 'country', 'exception', 'traveller', 'enter', 'canada', 'land', 'sea', 'include', 'citizen', 'require', 'go', 'mandatory', 'quarantine', 'found', 'violate', 'restriction', 'subject', 'fine', 'c', 'month', 'jail', 'expulsion', 'country', 'even', 'travel', 'within', 'country', 'province', 'subject', 'requirement', 'may', 'include', 'selfisolations', 'long', 'peaceful', 'border', 'world', 'canada', 'united', 'state', 'effectively', 'seal', 'since', 'march', 'restriction', 'extend', 'june', 'continue', 'least', 'july', 'coronavirus', 'upended', 'everything', 'painfully', 'unwound', 'decade', 'profitable', 'growth', 'rovinescu', 'say', 'opening', 'travel', 'smart', 'measure', 'way', 'important', 'leisure', 'travel', 'sector', 'critical', 'entire', 'canadian', 'economy', 'rovinescu', 'say', 'call', 'government', 'use', 'sciencebased', 'approach', 'country', 'enter', 'phase', 'must', 'find', 'responsible', 'way', 'coexist', 'coronavirus', 'need', 'permit', 'prudently', 'cautiously', 'business', 'way', 'country', 'tell', 'shareholder', 'federal', 'provincial', 'government', 'matter', 'urgency', 'need', 'find', 'thoughtful', 'way', 'achieve', 'vital', 'public', 'health', 'objective', 'way', 'allows', 'prudent', 'opening', 'lift', 'restriction', 'safely', 'resume', 'level', 'pandemic', 'effect', 'threaten', 'upend', 'canada', 'plan', 'takeover', 'holiday', 'specialist', 'transat', 'transaction', 'overwhelmingly', 'approve', 'transat', 'shareholder', 'august', 'due', 'close', 'middle', 'however', 'continue', 'scrutiny', 'various', 'regulatory', 'agency', 'include', 'european', 'commission', 'canada', 'competition', 'watchdog', 'unconfirmed', 'report', 'canada', 'frenchlanguage', 'medium', 'earlier', 'month', 'claimed', 'canada', 'search', 'way', 'exit', 'deal', 'due', 'liquidity', 'issue', 'june', 'canada', 'calgarybased', 'competitor', 'westjet', 'nation', 'secondlargest', 'say', 'eliminate', 'job', 'consolidate', 'outsource', 'service', 'call', 'centre', 'airport', 'operation', 'seek', 'reduce', 'cost']"
"Qantas Group will raise up to A$1.9 billion ($1.3 billion) in equity capital to strengthen its balance sheet, as part of a three-year plan to accelerate its recovery from the Covid-19 crisis. This encompasses A$1.36 billion from a fully underwritten institutional placement, and up to A$500 million from a non-underwritten share purchase plan extended to eligible existing shareholders in Australia and New Zealand. “Proceeds from the equity raising will be used to accelerate the group's recovery, strengthen its balance sheet and position it to capitalise on opportunities aligned with its strategy,” the company said in a statement on 25 June. The institutional placement is being conducted today and Qantas is offering shares to institutional investors, each at a placement price of A$3.65. This represents a 12.9% discount to the last traded price of A$4.19 on 24 June. Around 372.7 million new fully paid ordinary shares will be issued under the placement and represents 25% of the company's existing shares issued, which Qantas says has decreased by more than a third in recent years through share buybacks. On 31 March, the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) announced temporary capital raising relief measures to accommodate the need for listed entities to raise capital due to the effects of the Covid-19 outbreak, and adjusted the limits on relevant capital raising announced on or after 23 April from 15% to 25%. This means Qantas does not need to seek shareholder approval for the placement under ASX's class waiver decision on temporary extra placement capacity, dated 23 April. For the institutional placement, Qantas will allocate eligible existing institutional shareholders their full entitlement on a best endeavours basis. It says that remaining shares will be prioritised to existing shareholders, and potential new shareholders will be evaluated for their likelihood of long-term support for the group, among other factors. Under the share purchase plan, which Qantas' board has decided to cap at A$500 million, the issue price will be the lesser of the A$3.65 placement price offered to institutional investors, and a 2.5% discount to the five-day volume-weighted average price of Qantas shares up to and including 22 July, the closing date of the share purchase plan. Each eligible shareholder can apply for up to A$30,000 of new fully paid ordinary shares on a gross basis. The company says, “Qantas considers that the share purchase plan will cater for the vast majority of its non-institutional shareholders, enabling them to participate and potentially increase their relative percentage holdings in Qantas.” After Qantas completes the underwritten institutional placement, it expects to have A$4.6 billion in available liquidity, comprising of A$3.6 billion cash and A$1 billion of undrawn facilities. This does not include proceeds from the share purchase plan. As at 31 May, the company's pro forma net debt is expected to be A$4.7 billion with no major debt maturities until June 2021, and there are no financial covenants on its debt. The group will also revoke the payment of its interim dividend, which has been deferred since 19 March, allowing it to conserve A$201 million of cash. “Decisions on future dividends will continue to be made in line with the group's financial framework,” it says.",6,17,8.0,0.4734,"government, uk, carrier, business, state, share, south, airway, financial, plan","['qantas', 'raise', 'equity', 'capital', 'strengthen', 'balance', 'sheet', 'part', 'threeyear', 'plan', 'accelerate', 'recovery', 'coronavirus', 'crisis', 'encompasses', 'fully', 'underwritten', 'institutional', 'placement', 'nonunderwritten', 'share', 'purchase', 'plan', 'extend', 'eligible', 'exist', 'shareholder', 'australia', 'zealand', 'proceeds', 'equity', 'raise', 'use', 'accelerate', 'recovery', 'strengthen', 'balance', 'sheet', 'position', 'capitalise', 'opportunity', 'align', 'strategy', 'say', 'statement', 'june', 'institutional', 'placement', 'conduct', 'today', 'qantas', 'offering', 'share', 'institutional', 'investor', 'placement', 'price', 'represent', 'discount', 'trade', 'price', 'june', 'around', 'fully', 'paid', 'ordinary', 'share', 'issue', 'placement', 'represent', 'exist', 'share', 'issue', 'qantas', 'say', 'decrease', 'third', 'recent', 'share', 'buyback', 'march', 'australian', 'security', 'exchange', 'asx', 'announce', 'temporary', 'capital', 'raise', 'relief', 'measure', 'accommodate', 'need', 'list', 'entity', 'raise', 'capital', 'due', 'effect', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'adjust', 'limit', 'relevant', 'capital', 'raise', 'announce', 'april', 'mean', 'qantas', 'need', 'seek', 'shareholder', 'approval', 'placement', 'asx', 'class', 'waiver', 'decision', 'temporary', 'extra', 'placement', 'capacity', 'date', 'april', 'institutional', 'placement', 'qantas', 'allocate', 'eligible', 'exist', 'institutional', 'shareholder', 'full', 'entitlement', 'best', 'endeavour', 'basis', 'say', 'remain', 'share', 'prioritise', 'exist', 'shareholder', 'potential', 'shareholder', 'evaluate', 'likelihood', 'longterm', 'support', 'among', 'factor', 'share', 'purchase', 'plan', 'qantas', 'board', 'decide', 'cap', 'issue', 'price', 'lesser', 'placement', 'price', 'offer', 'institutional', 'investor', 'discount', 'fiveday', 'volumeweighted', 'average', 'price', 'qantas', 'share', 'include', 'july', 'closing', 'date', 'share', 'purchase', 'plan', 'eligible', 'shareholder', 'apply', 'fully', 'paid', 'ordinary', 'share', 'gross', 'basis', 'say', 'qantas', 'considers', 'share', 'purchase', 'plan', 'cater', 'vast', 'majority', 'noninstitutional', 'shareholder', 'enable', 'participate', 'potentially', 'increase', 'relative', 'percentage', 'holding', 'qantas', 'completes', 'underwritten', 'institutional', 'placement', 'expect', 'available', 'liquidity', 'comprise', 'cash', 'undrawn', 'facility', 'include', 'proceeds', 'share', 'purchase', 'plan', 'may', 'pro', 'forma', 'net', 'debt', 'expect', 'major', 'debt', 'maturity', 'june', 'financial', 'covenant', 'debt', 'revoke', 'payment', 'interim', 'dividend', 'defer', 'since', 'march', 'allow', 'conserve', 'cash', 'decision', 'future', 'dividend', 'continue', 'make', 'line', 'financial', 'framework', 'say']"
"IATA has highlighted research findings that quarantine effectively shuts down passenger demand for air travel, and is urging governments to adopt a variety of alternative measures to minimise the risk of importing coronavirus via infected passengers. The airline association's proposed framework consists of measures to prevent sick people from traveling and to mitigate the risk of transmission should a passenger discover they have Covid-19 after their arrival. “Imposing quarantine measures on arriving travellers keeps countries in isolation and the travel and tourism sector in lockdown,” says IATA director general Alexandre de Juniac. “Fortunately, there are policy alternatives that can reduce the risk of importing Covid-19 infections while still allowing for the resumption of travel and tourism that are vital to jump-starting national economies.” Key to IATA's strategy is discouraging people with symptoms from travelling. Airlines can assist with this by allowing customers the flexibility to rebook if they become ill or are exposed to the virus. Health declarations can also be a tool to conduct screening, along with temperature checks. IATA argues that temperature checks are non-intrusive and act as a deterrent to passengers who may be tempted to travel while unwell, thus helping to shore up passenger confidence. IATA says 80% of surveyed travellers indicated that such checks improved their feeling of safety. The association is also urging governments to consider coronavirus testing for travellers from countries with high rates of new infections. It recommends that these take place prior to arrival at their departure airport, to avoid congestion and the potential for contagion. For cases where an infected person does travel, IATA underlines the importance of following its guidelines to mitigate the risk of transmission on board, including mask-wearing, sanitisation, health declarations, and social distancing where possible. Contact tracing and measures to reduce the transmission rate in tourism hotspots should also be adopted. IATA says these measures would allow the global economy to reopen, and notes that tourism alone is responsible for around 10% of GDP and 300 million jobs. Quarantine is effectively a travel ban, IATA contends, citing research that found 83% of travellers would not even consider travelling if quarantines were in force. Analysis of quarantines shows that imposing such measures results in arrivals decreasing by 90%, a similar figure to when foreign arrivals are banned. “Safely restarting the economy is a priority,” says de Juniac. “That includes travel and tourism. Quarantine measures may play a role in keeping people safe, but they will also keep many unemployed. The alternative is to reduce risks through a series of measures. “Airlines are already offering flexibility so there is no incentive for sick or at-risk people to travel. Health declarations, screening, and testing by governments will add extra layers of protection. And if someone travels while infected, we can reduce the risk of transmission with protocols to prevent the spread during travel or when at destination.”",6,18,12.0,0.4907,"travel, government, country, coronavirus, measure, restriction, passenger, state, march, canada","['iata', 'highlight', 'research', 'finding', 'quarantine', 'effectively', 'shuts', 'passenger', 'demand', 'travel', 'urge', 'government', 'adopt', 'variety', 'alternative', 'measure', 'minimise', 'risk', 'import', 'coronavirus', 'via', 'infect', 'passenger', 'association', 'propose', 'framework', 'consists', 'measure', 'prevent', 'sick', 'people', 'travel', 'mitigate', 'risk', 'transmission', 'passenger', 'discover', 'coronavirus', 'arrival', 'impose', 'quarantine', 'measure', 'arrive', 'traveller', 'keep', 'country', 'isolation', 'travel', 'tourism', 'sector', 'lockdown', 'say', 'iata', 'director', 'general', 'alexandre', 'de', 'juniac', 'fortunately', 'policy', 'alternative', 'reduce', 'risk', 'import', 'coronavirus', 'infection', 'still', 'allow', 'resumption', 'travel', 'tourism', 'vital', 'jumpstarting', 'national', 'key', 'iata', 'strategy', 'discourage', 'people', 'symptom', 'travel', 'assist', 'allow', 'customer', 'flexibility', 'rebook', 'become', 'ill', 'expose', 'virus', 'health', 'declaration', 'tool', 'conduct', 'screen', 'along', 'temperature', 'check', 'iata', 'argues', 'temperature', 'check', 'nonintrusive', 'act', 'deterrent', 'passenger', 'may', 'tempt', 'travel', 'unwell', 'thus', 'help', 'shore', 'passenger', 'confidence', 'iata', 'say', 'survey', 'traveller', 'indicate', 'check', 'improve', 'feel', 'safety', 'association', 'urge', 'government', 'consider', 'coronavirus', 'test', 'traveller', 'country', 'high', 'rate', 'infection', 'recommends', 'take', 'place', 'prior', 'arrival', 'departure', 'airport', 'avoid', 'congestion', 'potential', 'contagion', 'case', 'infect', 'person', 'travel', 'iata', 'underline', 'importance', 'follow', 'guideline', 'mitigate', 'risk', 'transmission', 'board', 'include', 'maskwearing', 'sanitisation', 'health', 'declaration', 'social', 'distance', 'possible', 'contact', 'trace', 'measure', 'reduce', 'transmission', 'rate', 'tourism', 'hotspot', 'adopt', 'iata', 'say', 'measure', 'allow', 'global', 'economy', 'reopen', 'note', 'tourism', 'alone', 'responsible', 'around', 'gdp', 'job', 'quarantine', 'effectively', 'travel', 'ban', 'iata', 'contends', 'cite', 'research', 'found', 'traveller', 'even', 'consider', 'travel', 'quarantine', 'force', 'analysis', 'quarantine', 'impose', 'measure', 'result', 'arrival', 'decrease', 'similar', 'figure', 'foreign', 'arrival', 'ban', 'safely', 'restart', 'economy', 'priority', 'say', 'de', 'juniac', 'include', 'travel', 'tourism', 'quarantine', 'measure', 'may', 'play', 'role', 'keep', 'people', 'safe', 'keep', 'many', 'unemployed', 'alternative', 'reduce', 'risk', 'series', 'measure', 'already', 'offering', 'flexibility', 'incentive', 'sick', 'atrisk', 'people', 'travel', 'health', 'declaration', 'screen', 'test', 'government', 'add', 'extra', 'layer', 'protection', 'someone', 'travel', 'infect', 'reduce', 'risk', 'transmission', 'protocol', 'prevent', 'spread', 'travel', 'destination']"
"Canada's WestJet has permanently cut more than one third of its remaining workforce as the effects of the pandemic force the airline to reduce and outsource services in an effort to continue cutting costs. Chief executive Ed Sims says in a video message on 24 June that the company will permanently eliminate the roles of 3,333 members of staff, also known as “WestJetters”, throughout the organization. That will leave less than 5,000 employees out of a pre-coronavirus workforce of 14,000. The Calgary-based carrier will consolidate its contact centre activity to one location only - Calgary - and outsource airport operations at all domestic airports other than Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton and Toronto. In addition, the airline will “strategically restructure our office and our management staff”. WestJet cuts 3,333 jobs after the coronavirus grounds much of its fleet The staff reductions at Canada's second-largest airline come as a blow just ten days after it said it was expanding its summer schedule in July to more than double what had been planned for June. “This situation is nobody's fault and nothing anyone could have done would have created a different outcome,” Sims says. “Reducing WestJetter roles has always been a last resort. If there were other viable options open to us we would be taking them.” Sims says that the airline has cut its costs by about 60%, but that numerous issues in the past four months have exacerbated the problems for the business. “Despite these efforts, the damage we have incurred from a weakened demand environment has been compounded by multiple factors including a patchwork of provincial and federal travel advisories, constraints on non-essential travel both globally and even domestically, and cost challenges facing our airport and air navigation partners,” he says in the video. WestJet's management reacted to the impending global pandemic crisis early, with the hope that it could save jobs. In mid-March already, it had grounded a sizeable amount of aircraft and implemented cost-reduction measures such as releasing contractors, instituting a hiring freeze, stopping non-essential travel, cutting management salaries and suspending capital projects. On 24 March, WestJet laid off about half of its staff, 90% of whom volunteered to leave their roles temporarily to save the company. In April 1,700 pilots were also laid off. The company was able to hire some back after participating in Canada's emergency wage subsidy programme, but more layoffs occurred in May. With the crisis now well into its fourth month, the airline, like many of its peers across North America and around the world, is still struggling. The airline says that its capacity in June is down “more than 90%” from pre-coronavirus levels as shelter-in-place orders remain in effect to avoid the spread of the highly contagious virus.

"The coronavirus downturn has led Airbus to scrap its planned development of an A320neo engine nacelle that would have competed with nacelles produced by supplier Collins Aerospace. The reversal stands to affect Bombardier's Belfast, Northern Ireland manufacturing site, which Airbus picked to produce the nacelle, and Spirit AeroSystems, which plans to acquire Bombardier's Belfast site. Airbus had for several years been moving forward with the effort to develop a competing nacelle for A320neos powered by Pratt & Whitney PW1100G turbofans. The plan did not affect A320neos powered by CFM International Leap-1As. Safran Nacelles makes that variant's unit.  An Airbus A320neo powered by a Pratt & Whitney PW1100G turbofan “Airbus has decided it will stop the marketing, development and manufacturing of its own nacelle to concentrate its efforts on the current existing nacelle,” the European airframer says in a statement. “As such, only the existing Collins nacelle for the A320neo-family aircraft powered by the PW1100G engine will be offered.” Airbus attributes the change to the coronavirus downturn. “The unprecedented Covid-19 crisis leaves Airbus with no choice than to revisit all current and future product development activities to protect our cash and reduce as much as possible our expenditures,” it says. “We have concluded that it is in the interest of our customers to concentrate on mature and existing product offerings.” Collins, a subsidiary of Raytheon Technologies, declines to comment. P&W is also owned by Raytheon. Airbus' nacelle ambitions had conformed with an industry trend under which airframers have recently brought more work in-house, competing with suppliers. Boeing also recently took nacelle and propulsions system work back from suppliers. Collins had expected Airbus would offer a competing nacelle after 2024, when a sole-source contract expired, Raytheon chief executive Gregory Hayes said in 2017. At the time, Hayes was CEO of Raytheon corporate predecessor United Technologies, which performed the nacelle work via its United Technologies Aerospace Systems (UTAS) business. UTAS merged with Rockwell Collins to form Collins Aerospace in 2018. Also in 2017, Airbus chose Bombardier Aerostructures and Engineering Services as manufacturer of its new nacelles for PW1100G-powered A320neos. That work was to be performed at Bombardier's Northern Ireland site. Wichita aerostructures company Spirit, which is beset by issues stemming from the 737 Max grounding, agreed last year to purchase the Belfast site, and facilities in Morocco and Dallas, from Bombardier for $500 million. Spirit says its acquisition plan remains unchanged.

"UK budget carrier EasyJet is aiming to raise £400-450 million through issuing new shares equating to just under 15% of the current share capital. Up to 59.54 million shares will be placed through an immediate accelerated bookbuilding process. EasyJet has started restoring flight operations after an 11-week grounding. It says this is shorter than the three-month grounding for which it has expected, under its latest calculations, a cash-burn of £1 billion. EasyJet says it has drawn on a $500 million credit facility, £600 million in UK government coronavirus corporate funding, and £400 million through two new loans. It has also obtained £301 million from sale-and-leaseback transactions, and expects another £200-350 million from similar agreements. EasyJet's cash position, as of 22 June, stood at £2.4 billion. EasyJet is expecting to raise up to £450 million through the new stock issue Over the first half of its financial year the company made a pre-tax loss of £353 million, compared with the previous interim loss of £272 million. This loss included a charge of £160 million relating mainly to ineffective fuel hedges. The company's passenger numbers fell by 7.4% to 38.6 million, although coronavirus only affected the last couple of weeks of the six-month period. But revenues increased by 1.6% to £2.38 billion, assisted by German network improvements, the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook Group and other matters. EasyJet expects its fourth-quarter capacity – for the July-September summer period – to be around 30% of the pre-crisis planned level. But it has refrained from offering guidance on its financial performance over the second half of the year. Chief executive Johan Lundgren says the carrier is continuing efforts to “strengthen” its balance sheet. The new share placing, the company states, will “further enhance” its liquidity position and underpin its balance sheet, increasing the cash balance to around £3 billion. This will provide a “significant liquidity buffer”, allowing the company to work through any further grounding scenarios or a “protracted recovery”, it says. Around half the airline's fleet will remain unencumbered, it adds, allowing it to access further funding if necessary. EasyJet had obtained shareholder approval in February to issue shares equivalent to some 10% of the capital. But it says that, given the “unforeseen and exceptional” circumstances, it is expanding the share issue, which means a portion will be conditional on a further shareholder clearance through a meeting set for around 14 July.",6,21,8.0,0.2973,"government, uk, carrier, business, state, share, south, airway, financial, plan","['uk', 'budget', 'carrier', 'easyjet', 'aim', 'raise', 'issue', 'share', 'equate', 'current', 'share', 'capital', 'share', 'place', 'immediate', 'accelerate', 'bookbuilding', 'process', 'easyjet', 'start', 'restore', 'operation', 'ground', 'say', 'shorter', 'threemonth', 'ground', 'expect', 'late', 'calculation', 'cashburn', 'easyjet', 'say', 'drawn', 'credit', 'facility', 'uk', 'government', 'coronavirus', 'corporate', 'funding', 'loan', 'obtain', 'saleandleaseback', 'transaction', 'expect', 'another', 'similar', 'agreement', 'easyjet', 'cash', 'position', 'june', 'stood', 'easyjet', 'expect', 'raise', 'stock', 'issue', 'half', 'financial', 'make', 'pretax', 'loss', 'compare', 'previous', 'interim', 'loss', 'loss', 'include', 'charge', 'relate', 'mainly', 'ineffective', 'fuel', 'hedge', 'passenger', 'number', 'fell', 'although', 'coronavirus', 'affected', 'couple', 'week', 'sixmonth', 'period', 'revenue', 'increase', 'assist', 'german', 'network', 'improvement', 'bankruptcy', 'thomas', 'cook', 'matter', 'easyjet', 'expect', 'fourthquarter', 'capacity', 'julyseptember', 'summer', 'period', 'around', 'precrisis', 'plan', 'level', 'refrain', 'offering', 'guidance', 'financial', 'performance', 'second', 'half', 'chief', 'executive', 'johan', 'lundgren', 'say', 'carrier', 'continue', 'effort', 'strengthen', 'balance', 'sheet', 'share', 'place', 'state', 'far', 'enhance', 'liquidity', 'position', 'underpin', 'balance', 'sheet', 'increase', 'cash', 'balance', 'around', 'provide', 'significant', 'liquidity', 'buffer', 'allow', 'work', 'far', 'ground', 'scenario', 'protract', 'recovery', 'say', 'around', 'half', 'fleet', 'remain', 'unencumbered', 'add', 'allow', 'access', 'far', 'funding', 'necessary', 'easyjet', 'obtain', 'shareholder', 'approval', 'february', 'issue', 'share', 'equivalent', 'capital', 'say', 'give', 'unforeseen', 'exceptional', 'circumstance', 'expand', 'share', 'issue', 'mean', 'portion', 'conditional', 'far', 'shareholder', 'clearance', 'meeting', 'set', 'around', 'july']"
"The Federal Aviation Administration his finalised a rule requiring that operators inspect Boeing 737 Max wiring shields for issues that could, in extreme circumstances, cause dual-engine failures or erroneous engine data. The rule, made public 24 June, does not relate to the flight control system implicated as a factor contributing to two 737 Max crashes. The FAA's airworthiness directive (AD) requires that 737 Max 8s and Max 9s be inspected for wiring shield issues prior to flight. Both models remain grounded following the crashes, and Boeing predicts regulators will clear the jet in time to allow deliveries to resume in the third quarter.  Boeing itself addressed the wire-shield issue with a service bulletin released in December 2019. The FAA's order follows reports that “exterior fairing panels on the top of the engine nacelle and strut...may not have the quality of electrical bonding necessary to ensure adequate shielding”. Specifically, operators must inspect thumbnail and mid-strut fairing panels for issues with an aluminium foil that shields aircraft wiring “from the electromagnetic effects of high-intensity radiated fields”, according to FAA documents. Such fields are caused by “electromagnetic energy from radar, radio, television and other ground-based, shipborne or airborne radio frequency transmitters”, according to earlier FAA materials. Those signals can affect modern aircraft that rely heavily on electric systems. In the case of the 737 Max, “cuts” in the aluminium foil can cause electromagnetic energy to affecting wiring in ways that “could potentially lead to a dual-engine power loss event and/or display of hazardously misleading primary propulsion parameters”, the AD says. Asked to comment, Boeing says it “recommended this action in December 2019 and has been working closely with our customers to ensure the 737 Max's engine nacelles are fully protected from electrical energy. We support the FAA's airworthiness directive, which makes our recommended action mandatory”. The FAA's original proposed rule, released in February, also said the aluminium cuts made 737 Max more susceptible to risks caused by lightning strikes. But the agency removed mention of lightning from the final rule after Boeing objected. The airframer said that, even with cuts in the aluminium, the Max's systems have sufficient margins to protect against lightning strikes. Boeing also asked the FAA to require that the inspections be completed before next “revenue” flight, rather than before non-revenue flights. The FAA declined that request. Boeing has told the FAA it will cover the cost of the work under 737 Max warranties.",6,22,11.0,0.5151,"pilot, faa, issue, safety, include, report, require, training, ground, order","['federal', 'administration', 'finalise', 'rule', 'require', 'operator', 'inspect', 'wiring', 'shield', 'issue', 'extreme', 'circumstance', 'cause', 'dualengine', 'failure', 'erroneous', 'engine', 'data', 'rule', 'make', 'public', 'june', 'relate', 'control', 'system', 'implicate', 'factor', 'contribute', 'crash', 'faa', 'airworthiness', 'directive', 'ad', 'require', 'inspect', 'wiring', 'shield', 'issue', 'prior', 'model', 'remain', 'ground', 'follow', 'crash', 'predicts', 'regulator', 'clear', 'jet', 'allow', 'delivery', 'resume', 'third', 'quarter', 'address', 'wireshield', 'issue', 'service', 'bulletin', 'release', 'december', 'faa', 'order', 'follow', 'report', 'exterior', 'fair', 'panel', 'top', 'engine', 'nacelle', 'strut', 'may', 'quality', 'electrical', 'bonding', 'necessary', 'ensure', 'adequate', 'shield', 'specifically', 'operator', 'must', 'inspect', 'thumbnail', 'midstrut', 'fair', 'panel', 'issue', 'aluminium', 'foil', 'shield', 'wiring', 'electromagnetic', 'effect', 'highintensity', 'radiate', 'field', 'accord', 'faa', 'document', 'field', 'cause', 'electromagnetic', 'energy', 'radar', 'radio', 'television', 'groundbased', 'shipborne', 'airborne', 'radio', 'frequency', 'transmitter', 'accord', 'earlier', 'faa', 'material', 'signal', 'affect', 'modern', 'rely', 'heavily', 'electric', 'system', 'case', 'cut', 'aluminium', 'foil', 'cause', 'electromagnetic', 'energy', 'affect', 'wiring', 'way', 'potentially', 'lead', 'dualengine', 'power', 'loss', 'event', 'display', 'hazardously', 'mislead', 'primary', 'propulsion', 'parameter', 'ad', 'say', 'ask', 'comment', 'say', 'recommend', 'action', 'december', 'work', 'closely', 'customer', 'ensure', 'engine', 'nacelle', 'fully', 'protect', 'electrical', 'energy', 'support', 'faa', 'airworthiness', 'directive', 'make', 'recommend', 'action', 'mandatory', 'faa', 'original', 'propose', 'rule', 'release', 'february', 'say', 'aluminium', 'cut', 'make', 'susceptible', 'risk', 'cause', 'lightning', 'strike', 'agency', 'remove', 'mention', 'lightning', 'final', 'rule', 'object', 'airframer', 'say', 'even', 'cut', 'aluminium', 'system', 'sufficient', 'margin', 'protect', 'lightning', 'strike', 'ask', 'faa', 'require', 'inspection', 'complete', 'next', 'revenue', 'rather', 'nonrevenue', 'faa', 'decline', 'request', 'told', 'faa', 'cover', 'cost', 'work', 'warranty']"
"Investigators have revealed that the crew of a crashed Pakistan International Airlines Airbus A320 did attempt to lower the landing-gear during their first approach to Karachi, but raised the gear lever again during the descent. The Civil Aviation Authority of Pakistan confirms that the A320 touched down on Karachi's runway 25L with its undercarriage raised, causing the jet to slide along the ground on its engine nacelles, before climbing away. Surveillance video shows flight PK8303 touching down with landing-gear retracted Its preliminary findings catalogue a badly-managed approach, during which the A320 – arriving from Lahore on 22 May – had been cleared to descend to 3,000ft by the time it reached the MAKLI waypoint, about 16nm from the runway. But the aircraft remained far too high, crossing MAKLI at nearly 9,800ft and travelling at 245kt. The crew opted to lose the excess height by selecting 'open descent' mode, which reduces engine thrust to idle and the autopilot uses pitch to prioritise a target airspeed. But both autopilots were disengaged and the aircraft's speedbrakes were deployed. The approach controller advised the aircraft to carry out an orbit, to give the crew time to lose height, but no such orbit was carried out. As the aircraft descended through 7,221ft – about 10.5nm from the runway – the flight-data recorder registered that the landing-gear lever was selected 'down'. While the A320 has a safety valve preventing the landing-gear being lowered above 260kt, flight-recorder information suggests the aircraft was travelling at about 250kt at this point. But the inquiry has not specified whether the crew confirmed the gear was deployed, nor has it disclosed the gear indications shown by the aircraft instruments. The controller “repeatedly” advised the crew to discontinue the approach and warned about the excessive height, but the aircraft continued with its attempts to intercept the localiser and glideslope. As the jet descended through 1,740ft, about 5nm from touchdown, the flight-data recorder showed the aircraft's landing-gear lever was selected 'up', raising the undercarriage, and the speedbrakes retracted. The reasons for this 'gear up' selection have not been determined. But cockpit-voice recordings reveal warnings that the landing-gear was not down were “disregarded”, says the inquiry, along with ground-proximity and overspeed alerts. Instead of handing the flight to Karachi airport controllers, the approach controller sought landing clearance from the airport. This was granted, without the controllers noticing the retracted landing-gear. Flight-data recorder information shows that, as the jet passed 500ft, it was still travelling at high speed – some 220kt – and descending at 2,000ft/min. “The landing was undertaken with landing-gears retracted,” says the inquiry. “The aircraft touched the runway surface on its engines. As the crew executed a go-around, the landing-gear was belatedly activated According to the inquiry, the pilots initially applied reverse-thrust and braking, as the powerplants scraped along the runway. But the CFM International CFM56 engine control unit uses weight-on-wheels switch logic to check the aircraft's wheels are deployed, and in contact with the ground, before allowing the thrust reversers to activate. The crew executed a go-around and the flight-data recorder captured a belated activation of the landing-gear lever to 'down', before it was immediately moved to 'up'. While the A320 initially climbed away, with its crew planning to make another approach to 25L, the engines “failed one by one”, says the inquiry. The ram-air turbine was deployed to provide power to essential systems, but the aircraft was unable to maintain height and the crew declared an emergency. Although the flight-data recorder stopped functioning, the inquiry determined that the aircraft descended with its landing-gear extended and that the free-fall gear-extension method had not been used. “[The] landing-gear in extended position did not demonstrate any malfunction of the landing-gear system,” it states. The aircraft came down in a built-up area about 1,340m from the runway 25L threshold. It was travelling at less than 150kt with a nose-high attitude, with the horizontal stabiliser positioned 2.8° nose-up. Flaps were found to be fully retracted. Investigators have discovered evidence pointing to the reason for failure of the right-hand CFM56 engine, but are continuing to probe the left-hand powerplant. Both showed indications of external fire, and both fans showed signs of being at low rotational speed at the time of impact.",6,23,7.0,0.669,"crew, runway, inquiry, land, approach, accident, investigator, captain, incident, pilot","['investigator', 'reveal', 'crew', 'crashed', 'pakistan', 'international', 'attempt', 'low', 'landinggear', 'approach', 'karachi', 'raise', 'gear', 'lever', 'descent', 'civil', 'authority', 'pakistan', 'confirms', 'touch', 'karachi', 'runway', 'undercarriage', 'raise', 'cause', 'jet', 'slide', 'along', 'ground', 'engine', 'nacelle', 'climb', 'away', 'surveillance', 'video', 'touch', 'landinggear', 'retract', 'preliminary', 'finding', 'catalogue', 'badlymanaged', 'approach', 'arrive', 'lahore', 'may', 'clear', 'descend', 'reach', 'makli', 'waypoint', 'runway', 'remain', 'far', 'high', 'cross', 'makli', 'nearly', 'travel', 'crew', 'opt', 'lose', 'excess', 'height', 'select', 'descent', 'mode', 'reduces', 'engine', 'thrust', 'idle', 'autopilot', 'pitch', 'prioritise', 'target', 'airspeed', 'autopilot', 'disengage', 'speedbrakes', 'deployed', 'approach', 'controller', 'advise', 'carry', 'orbit', 'give', 'crew', 'lose', 'height', 'orbit', 'carry', 'descend', 'runway', 'flightdata', 'recorder', 'register', 'landinggear', 'lever', 'select', 'safety', 'valve', 'prevent', 'landinggear', 'lower', 'flightrecorder', 'information', 'suggests', 'travel', 'point', 'inquiry', 'specify', 'whether', 'crew', 'confirm', 'gear', 'deployed', 'disclose', 'gear', 'indication', 'instrument', 'controller', 'repeatedly', 'advise', 'crew', 'discontinue', 'approach', 'warn', 'excessive', 'height', 'continued', 'attempt', 'intercept', 'localiser', 'glideslope', 'jet', 'descend', 'touchdown', 'flightdata', 'recorder', 'landinggear', 'lever', 'select', 'raise', 'undercarriage', 'speedbrakes', 'retract', 'reason', 'selection', 'determine', 'cockpitvoice', 'recording', 'reveal', 'warning', 'landinggear', 'disregard', 'say', 'inquiry', 'along', 'groundproximity', 'overspeed', 'alert', 'instead', 'hand', 'karachi', 'airport', 'controller', 'approach', 'controller', 'sought', 'land', 'clearance', 'airport', 'grant', 'without', 'controller', 'notice', 'retract', 'landinggear', 'flightdata', 'recorder', 'information', 'jet', 'pass', 'still', 'travel', 'high', 'speed', 'descend', 'land', 'undertaken', 'landinggears', 'retract', 'say', 'inquiry', 'touch', 'runway', 'surface', 'engine', 'crew', 'execute', 'goaround', 'landinggear', 'belatedly', 'activate', 'accord', 'inquiry', 'pilot', 'initially', 'apply', 'reversethrust', 'brake', 'powerplants', 'scrap', 'along', 'runway', 'cfm', 'international', 'engine', 'control', 'unit', 'weightonwheels', 'switch', 'logic', 'check', 'wheel', 'deployed', 'contact', 'ground', 'allow', 'thrust', 'reversers', 'activate', 'crew', 'execute', 'goaround', 'flightdata', 'recorder', 'capture', 'belated', 'activation', 'landinggear', 'lever', 'immediately', 'move', 'initially', 'climbed', 'away', 'crew', 'planning', 'make', 'another', 'approach', 'engine', 'fail', 'say', 'inquiry', 'ramair', 'turbine', 'deployed', 'provide', 'power', 'essential', 'system', 'unable', 'maintain', 'height', 'crew', 'declare', 'emergency', 'although', 'flightdata', 'recorder', 'stop', 'function', 'inquiry', 'determine', 'descend', 'landinggear', 'extend', 'freefall', 'gearextension', 'method', 'use', 'landinggear', 'extend', 'position', 'demonstrate', 'malfunction', 'landinggear', 'system', 'state', 'come', 'builtup', 'area', 'runway', 'threshold', 'travel', 'less', 'nosehigh', 'attitude', 'horizontal', 'stabiliser', 'position', 'noseup', 'flap', 'found', 'fully', 'retract', 'investigator', 'discover', 'evidence', 'point', 'reason', 'failure', 'righthand', 'engine', 'continue', 'probe', 'lefthand', 'powerplant', 'indication', 'external', 'fire', 'fan', 'sign', 'low', 'rotational', 'speed', 'impact']"
"NokScoot is making an unspecified number of staff redundant, and returning three aircraft by month-end, as part of a rationalisation of its business amid the pressures of the Covid-19 pandemic. “Following a review of our operations, NokScoot has taken steps to rationalise our business to cope with the huge impact on the airline industry caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. Despite some early signs of stabilising and the recent lifting of some restrictions across the world, borders and international movement of people remained highly restricted. Demand for air travel is not expected to return to the 2019 levels until 2022 or 2023,” NokScoot tells Cirium in a statement. The airline says that in response to weak demand for air travel, it has agreed with its lessor to return three aircraft by the end of the month. A source told Cirium on 24 June that all the aircraft are planned to be returned eventually as the company's shareholders are discussing winding up the joint venture, but NokScoot would not comment on this. Cirium fleets data show NokScoot operates a fleet of seven Boeing 777-200s and owns all the aircraft. Cirium data also show that NokScoot is 49% owned by Scoot, 49% by Nok Air and 2% by NokScoo tmanagement (Pueannammitr Co). “In response to the weak outlook for air travel, we have agreed with our lessor to return three aircraft by the end of this month. Regrettably, this means the need to reduce staff as well. It was a difficult decision and we understand the impact it will have on staff. All affected employees will be paid severance in full according to Thai labour law,” the airline said. “We are also mindful that alternative employment will be important to those affected and NokScoot will do all we can to provide support in this regard.

In 2015, following the Ebola outbreak, the GAO recommended a similar preparedness programme, but none has been developed so far. “DOT is now confronting an even more widespread public health crisis–the Coronavirus Disease (Covid-19) global pandemic–without having taken steps to implement this recommendation,” the GAO writes in a report published on 23 June. US government body urges the DOT to develop a preparedness plan for communicable diseases like the coronavirus that grounded thousands of aircraft “Not only could such a plan provide a mechanism for the public-health and aviation sectors to coordinate to more effectively prevent and control a communicable disease threat, it could also help minimize unnecessary disruptions to the national aviation system, disruptions that to date have been significant,” says the congressional watchdog. Passenger air transport across the country came to a near halt as states imposed shelter-in-place orders and travel demand fell to near zero. Many airlines temporarily slashed schedules and mothballed aircraft to save money, almost closing down the entire sector. In the past weeks, airlines have been slowly reinstating flights and bringing aircraft back into operation, but industry observers expect the rebound could take up to three years. The agency goes on to criticize that the current patchwork of reactions and requirements by airlines, airports and other aviation stakeholders has “demonstrated a need for a more coordinated response.” “The existence of a national plan might have reduced some of the confusion among aviation stakeholders and passengers,” the GAO writes. But the Department of Transportation (DOT) disagrees with the recommendations, pushing responsibility for such a plan onto other government agencies. “Through two administrations, this Department has disagreed with GAO's recommendation for a separate plan for aviation, which would risk an uncoordinated and disparate approach across different transportation modes and critical infrastructure sectors,” the DOT says. It adds that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) “has overall responsibility for communicable disease response and DHS has the lead in preparedness planning for all sectors, including transportation.” Personal safey and protection from the virus remain vitally important issues in travelers' decision-making process about if or when to return to the air travel. Various aviation-related interest groups, including pilots' union Air Line Pilots, International (ALPA), have criticized the DOT and the FAA for not implementing a coordinated response to the pandemic across all airline and passenger air transport operations. The union says several hundred of its members have been infected with the virus, and the uneven patchwork of measures that airlines have implemented do not keep crew or passengers safe. ALPA threw its support behind a plan published by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) earlier this month that provides guidance on how to safely resume air travel as jurisdictions begin to ease travel restrictions, and aviation returns to more “normal” operations. In recent testimony before the US Congress the flight attendants' union, the Association of Flight Attendants, also complained about the “a hodge-podge of individual voluntarily-adopted measures” by airlines that have put workers and passengers at risk of becoming sick. But in the past two weeks, more and more airlines have implemented increasingly stringent measures to attempt to inspire confidence in air travel. These include health questionnaires, mandatory face coverings, temperature checks, increased cleaning protocols and new boarding processes. The airlines have said that passengers who do not comply with the measures could be sanctioned, including being placed on a no-fly list for a certain period of time. On 12 June the DOT said it was distributing more than 100 million face coverings to airports and public transportation authorities to distribute to their patrons.",6,25,12.0,0.4076,"travel, government, country, coronavirus, measure, restriction, passenger, state, march, canada","['u', 'government', 'accountability', 'office', 'gao', 'recommend', 'u', 'department', 'transportation', 'dot', 'develop', 'national', 'preparedness', 'plan', 'respond', 'communicable', 'disease', 'like', 'coronavirus', 'pandemic', 'brought', 'transport', 'industry', 'near', 'standstill', 'earlier', 'second', 'congressional', 'watchdog', 'call', 'u', 'regulatory', 'authority', 'develop', 'plan', 'pandemic', 'global', 'reach', 'follow', 'ebola', 'outbreak', 'gao', 'recommend', 'similar', 'preparedness', 'programme', 'none', 'developed', 'far', 'dot', 'confront', 'even', 'widespread', 'public', 'health', 'coronavirus', 'disease', 'coronavirus', 'global', 'take', 'step', 'implement', 'recommendation', 'gao', 'writes', 'report', 'publish', 'june', 'u', 'government', 'body', 'urge', 'dot', 'develop', 'preparedness', 'plan', 'communicable', 'disease', 'like', 'coronavirus', 'ground', 'thousand', 'plan', 'provide', 'mechanism', 'publichealth', 'sector', 'coordinate', 'effectively', 'prevent', 'control', 'communicable', 'disease', 'threat', 'help', 'minimize', 'unnecessary', 'disruption', 'national', 'system', 'disruption', 'date', 'significant', 'say', 'congressional', 'watchdog', 'passenger', 'transport', 'across', 'country', 'come', 'near', 'halt', 'state', 'impose', 'shelterinplace', 'order', 'travel', 'demand', 'fell', 'near', 'zero', 'many', 'temporarily', 'slash', 'schedule', 'mothball', 'save', 'money', 'almost', 'closing', 'entire', 'sector', 'past', 'week', 'slowly', 'reinstate', 'bring', 'back', 'operation', 'industry', 'observer', 'expect', 'rebound', 'take', 'agency', 'go', 'criticize', 'current', 'patchwork', 'reaction', 'requirement', 'airport', 'stakeholder', 'demonstrate', 'need', 'coordinate', 'existence', 'national', 'plan', 'might', 'reduce', 'confusion', 'among', 'stakeholder', 'passenger', 'gao', 'writes', 'department', 'transportation', 'dot', 'disagrees', 'recommendation', 'push', 'responsibility', 'plan', 'onto', 'government', 'agency', 'administration', 'department', 'disagreed', 'gao', 'recommendation', 'separate', 'plan', 'risk', 'uncoordinated', 'disparate', 'approach', 'across', 'different', 'transportation', 'mode', 'critical', 'infrastructure', 'sector', 'dot', 'say', 'add', 'department', 'health', 'human', 'service', 'hhs', 'overall', 'responsibility', 'communicable', 'disease', 'response', 'dhs', 'lead', 'preparedness', 'planning', 'sector', 'include', 'personal', 'safey', 'protection', 'virus', 'remain', 'vitally', 'important', 'issue', 'traveler', 'decisionmaking', 'process', 'return', 'travel', 'various', 'aviationrelated', 'interest', 'include', 'pilot', 'union', 'line', 'pilot', 'international', 'alpa', 'criticize', 'dot', 'faa', 'implement', 'coordinate', 'response', 'pandemic', 'across', 'passenger', 'transport', 'operation', 'union', 'say', 'several', 'hundred', 'member', 'infect', 'virus', 'uneven', 'patchwork', 'measure', 'implement', 'keep', 'crew', 'passenger', 'safe', 'alpa', 'threw', 'support', 'behind', 'plan', 'publish', 'international', 'civil', 'organization', 'icao', 'earlier', 'month', 'provide', 'guidance', 'safely', 'resume', 'travel', 'jurisdiction', 'begin', 'ease', 'travel', 'restriction', 'return', 'normal', 'operation', 'recent', 'testimony', 'u', 'congress', 'attendant', 'union', 'association', 'attendant', 'complain', 'hodgepodge', 'individual', 'voluntarilyadopted', 'measure', 'put', 'worker', 'passenger', 'risk', 'become', 'sick', 'past', 'week', 'implement', 'increasingly', 'stringent', 'measure', 'attempt', 'inspire', 'confidence', 'travel', 'include', 'health', 'questionnaire', 'mandatory', 'face', 'covering', 'temperature', 'check', 'increase', 'cleaning', 'protocol', 'boarding', 'process', 'say', 'passenger', 'comply', 'measure', 'sanction', 'include', 'place', 'nofly', 'list', 'certain', 'period', 'june', 'dot', 'say', 'distribute', 'face', 'covering', 'airport', 'public', 'transportation', 'authority', 'distribute', 'patron']"
"Alaska Airlines will add Embraer 175 regional jets to its fleet flying within the state of Alaska, bringing in the smaller-gauge aircraft on routes that would not be profitable using larger jets. The Brazilian-made aircraft, operated by Alaska's regional partner Horizon Air, will begin service in Alaska in October 2020, the Seattle-based airline says on 22 June. The airline says the smaller jet will allow it to serve more destinations more often, and open further opportunities. “This jet gives us the flexibility to increase daily frequency between Anchorage and Fairbanks up to seven times a day, and to provide year-round service to King Salmon and Dillingham,” Alaska's regional vice-president Marilyn Romano says. “In time, the new mix of aircraft will unlock other markets in the state for future service.” According to Cirium fleets data, these routes had previously been flown with larger Boeing 737s, but that has become a costly proposition after the coronavirus pandemic and subsequent travel restrictions caused a sharp decline in passenger demand since the beginning of the year, motivating the airline to swap out the 737s for smaller jets. The change also allows Alaska to add frequencies in the void created on some routes when regional carrier Ravn Air ceased operations on 5 April. The E175s are configured with 12 first-class seats, 12 premium-economy seats and 52 economy seats, Alaska says. Air travel is the most reliable and regular form of transportation for both passengers and cargo to remote communities across the state, which is the USA's largest by area and closest to the Arctic Circle. Ground- and sea-based transportation networks are often only able to operate at certain times of the year or in specific weather conditions. In May, Alaska Air Group – the parent company of Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air - reported a $321 million operating loss during the first quarter, down from a $25 million operating profit in the same period a year earlier. The airline has said it hopes to reduce monthly cash burn to $200 million by June, down from $400 million in March. It collected $992 million in payroll support as part of the CARES Act, passed by the US Congress in March, designed to support airlines and prevent redundancies as they manage through the global crisis.",6,26,9.0,0.1941,"industry, crisis, demand, coronavirus, global, iata, market, level, cargo, expect","['alaska', 'add', 'embraer', 'regional', 'jet', 'fleet', 'fly', 'within', 'state', 'alaska', 'bring', 'smallergauge', 'route', 'profitable', 'use', 'large', 'jet', 'brazilianmade', 'operate', 'alaska', 'regional', 'partner', 'horizon', 'begin', 'service', 'alaska', 'october', 'seattlebased', 'say', 'june', 'say', 'small', 'jet', 'allow', 'serve', 'destination', 'often', 'open', 'far', 'opportunity', 'jet', 'give', 'u', 'flexibility', 'increase', 'daily', 'frequency', 'anchorage', 'fairbanks', 'day', 'provide', 'yearround', 'service', 'king', 'salmon', 'dillingham', 'alaska', 'regional', 'vicepresident', 'marilyn', 'romano', 'say', 'mix', 'unlock', 'market', 'state', 'future', 'accord', 'fleet', 'data', 'route', 'previously', 'flown', 'large', 'become', 'costly', 'proposition', 'coronavirus', 'pandemic', 'subsequent', 'travel', 'restriction', 'cause', 'sharp', 'decline', 'passenger', 'demand', 'since', 'begin', 'motivate', 'swap', 'small', 'jet', 'change', 'allows', 'alaska', 'add', 'frequency', 'void', 'create', 'route', 'regional', 'carrier', 'ravn', 'cease', 'operation', 'april', 'configure', 'firstclass', 'seat', 'premiumeconomy', 'seat', 'economy', 'seat', 'alaska', 'say', 'travel', 'reliable', 'regular', 'form', 'transportation', 'passenger', 'cargo', 'remote', 'community', 'across', 'state', 'usa', 'large', 'area', 'closest', 'arctic', 'circle', 'ground', 'seabased', 'transportation', 'network', 'often', 'able', 'operate', 'certain', 'specific', 'weather', 'condition', 'may', 'alaska', 'parent', 'alaska', 'horizon', 'report', 'operating', 'loss', 'quarter', 'operating', 'profit', 'period', 'earlier', 'say', 'hope', 'reduce', 'monthly', 'cash', 'burn', 'june', 'march', 'collect', 'payroll', 'support', 'part', 'care', 'act', 'pass', 'u', 'congress', 'march', 'design', 'support', 'prevent', 'redundancy', 'manage', 'global', 'crisis']"
"Emirates will begin reactivating its Airbus A380 fleet in mid-July with the reintroduction of the superjumbo on flights to Europe. The Dubai carrier said in a tweet on 23 June: “The iconic Emirates Airbus A380 will return to the skies with flights to London Heathrow and Paris starting from 15 July.” The airline's fleet of 115 A380s has been parked since late March in the wake of the coronavirus crisis. Emirates operates the aircraft in various seating configurations, one of which is the densest A380 layout in service at 615 seats. The plan to reintroduce A380 services follows the announcement of new protocols which will enable Dubai to be open to business and leisure visitors from 7 July. These protocols for travel into and out of Dubai airports were announced under the directives of the vice president and prime minister of the United Arab Emirates and Ruler of Dubai, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum. Emirates Airline president Tim Clark gave the double-decker his backing in a webinar interview earlier this month, amid speculation that the A380 would be a major victim of the crisis. He said it “would be folly to exclude large widebodied aircraft in the future.

"Russian carrier Ural Airlines has started reconverting aircraft back to passenger configuration, having temporarily modified them to operate as freighters. Ural Airlines says it converted 12 of its 48 jets to cargo configuration as passenger traffic bled away and freighter capacity demand rose during the coronavirus crisis. The operator has an all-Airbus fleet comprising 23 A320s, 15 A321s and five A319s, plus two A321neos and three A320neos. Three aircraft have already been switched back to a passenger layout. Each reconfiguration takes around two or three days, but the airline points out that certain types involve more work – the A321neo, for instance, requires reconnection of cables for USB ports. “With the gradual removal of quarantine measures and the beginning of the tourist season, Ural Airlines is again equipping its [aircraft interiors] for the needs of passengers,” says the carrier. Ural's fleet entirely comprises single-aisle Airbus jets Remaining aircraft are awaiting reconversion at Ekaterinburg and Moscow Zhukovsky. The carrier transported just 41,000 passengers during May, a fall of around 95%, according to figures from federal aviation regulator Rosaviatsia. Ural Airlines has been rejigging financial arrangements as part of its efforts to cope with the crisis. It has signed restructuring agreements with Gazprombank and Promsvyazbank, on loans of Rb800 million ($11.6 million) and Rb1 billion respectively.

"Iranian authorities appear set to send the flight recorders of the Boeing 737-800 shot down over Tehran to France for download of their data. The issue of reading the data following the event involving the Ukraine International Airlines flight PS752, operating from Tehran to Kiev on 8 January, has been mired in political discussion. But Iran's foreign affairs ministry states that minister Mohammad Javad Zarif has informed Canadian counterpart Francoias-Philippe Champagne that the Iranian authorities will transfer the recorders to France “in the coming days”. “A decision has been made regarding the sending of the [recorders], which will be implemented soon,” the ministry adds. It states that the coronavirus outbreak – which badly affected Iran – has complicated the situation. French authority BEA has the capability to retrieve the recorder information at its Paris facilities. None of those on board the 737-800 survived after two missiles from a Tor-M1 anti-aircraft system were launched shortly after the aircraft took off. Iran's Civil Aviation Organisation indicates that secondary radar contact with flight PS752 was initially lost about 3min after departure, as the aircraft climbed through 8,100ft, and that primary radar tracked it for a further 3min before it came down about 9nm from Tehran's Imam Khomeini airport.",6,29,10.0,0.3392,"international, authority, civil, state, investigation, case, add, january, airasia, crash","['iranian', 'authority', 'appear', 'set', 'send', 'recorder', 'shot', 'tehran', 'france', 'download', 'data', 'issue', 'reading', 'data', 'follow', 'event', 'involve', 'ukraine', 'international', 'operating', 'tehran', 'kiev', 'january', 'mire', 'political', 'discussion', 'iran', 'foreign', 'affair', 'ministry', 'state', 'minister', 'mohammad', 'javad', 'zarif', 'inform', 'canadian', 'counterpart', 'francoiasphilippe', 'champagne', 'iranian', 'authority', 'transfer', 'recorder', 'france', 'come', 'day', 'decision', 'make', 'regard', 'send', 'recorder', 'implement', 'soon', 'ministry', 'add', 'state', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'badly', 'affected', 'iran', 'complicate', 'situation', 'french', 'authority', 'bea', 'capability', 'retrieve', 'recorder', 'information', 'paris', 'facility', 'none', 'board', 'survive', 'missile', 'antiaircraft', 'system', 'launch', 'shortly', 'take', 'iran', 'civil', 'organisation', 'indicates', 'secondary', 'radar', 'contact', 'initially', 'lose', 'departure', 'climbed', 'primary', 'radar', 'tracked', 'far', 'come', 'tehran', 'imam', 'khomeini', 'airport']"
"Delta Air Lines will resume flights between the US and China this week, making it first US carrier to do so since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, as travel restrictions and regulatory sparring between the countries' aviation authorities ease. The Atlanta-based airline says on 22 June that its weekly flights between Seattle and Shanghai via Seoul will begin this week. In July, it will reinstate weekly flights to Shanghai from Detroit. The routes will be serviced with the airline's Airbus A350-900s. “We are excited to resume our services between the US and China, as economic and social activities start to recover,” says Wong Hong, Delta's president for greater China and Singapore. In the past two months, Delta had operated cargo-only flights to Seoul and Shanghai from Detroit and Los Angeles. But passenger travel was halted due to a regulatory spat between the two countries. Earlier in June, a tit-for-tat squabble between the US Department of Transportation (DOT) and the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) threatened to halt flights between the two countries indefinitely. Shortly after the coronavirus crisis had been deemed a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March, China restricted inbound international flights – a bid to stem the number of imported cases. That order prohibited carriers from adding more capacity than they had in schedules on 12 March – a date on which US airlines had no China flights. In May, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines applied to the CAAC for authority to resume passenger flights between the two countries as cases waned, but he CAAC denied their requests. On 3 June, the DOT responded by blocking Chinese airlines from flying to the USA from mid-June. But the CAAC soon relented, allowing US carriers to fly a combined four weekly flights to Mainland China, according to the US DOT. That agency then granted the same authority to Chinese airlines. United's flight schedules show it will resume service to China in late July, with flights from San Francisco to Shanghai.

"Over a decade since a fatal Bombardier Learjet 60 overrun in South Carolina, operators of the type are being ordered to install a voice-command warning system to alert pilots to thrust-reverser malfunctions. The aircraft, operated by Global Exec Aviation, had been departing for Van Nuys from runway 11 at Columbia Metropolitan airport. But the aircraft's main-gear tyres, which were badly under-inflated, burst during the take-off roll and – although the jet was beyond the V1 decision speed – the crew attempted to abort. Although the crew deployed the thrust-reversers, the landing-gear damage interfered with the air-ground system logic, causing uncommanded stowing of the reversers after their deployment – effectively resulting in thrust from the engines accelerating the aircraft forward. The Learjet overran and was destroyed by fire, fatally injuring both pilots and two of the four passengers. Under a new directive, effective 25 June, the US FAA is ordering installation of a voice-command warning system to “mitigate” failure of the reverser system by alerting the crew. It says the modification needs to be carried out within two years or 1,200h in service. The National Transportation Safety Board had issued a recommendation in July 2009, about 10 months after the September 2008 accident, that Learjet should install improved aural or visual cues on the aircraft to allow pilots to recognise inadvertent reverser stowage. Despite more than a decade passing since the accident and the recommendation, the FAA has declined an NTSB request to shorten the compliance time. The FAA says it “considered the urgency” of the unsafe condition and the “practical aspects” of achieving the modification within a period that aligns with most operators' normal maintenance schedules. It also rejected a request, from a separate commenter, to withdraw the directive for reasons that aircraft designs have moved away from using multitudes of aural warnings. The FAA says the change incorporates a “direct aural voice command for a rapid effective response” and will “prevent” scenarios similar to the Columbia Learjet 60 accident. Investigators had criticised both Learjet's and the FAA's safety analysis for the aircraft and the decision to certify the type, in 1993, to some standards which applied to the original Learjet 24 model in 1966. This decision “allowed for deficiencies” which would “not likely” have been present if updated regulations had been applied. The inquiry also expressed concern over modifications introduced after a previous thrust-reverser accident, which occurred to a Learjet 60 landing at Troy, Alabama, in January 2001. It found that Learjet's analysis and the FAA's review of the modification were inadequate and did not address design deficiencies, pointing out that a crew procedure – rather than a design change – was initially introduced to mitigate the “serious” hazard of uncommanded forward thrust, and that a subsequent supplementary design change also failed to address the problem.",6,31,6.0,0.2866,"engine, maintenance, fuel, takeoff, result, failure, system, problem, power, issue","['decade', 'since', 'fatal', 'bombardier', 'learjet', 'overrun', 'south', 'carolina', 'operator', 'type', 'order', 'install', 'voicecommand', 'warn', 'system', 'alert', 'pilot', 'thrustreverser', 'malfunction', 'operate', 'global', 'exec', 'depart', 'van', 'nuys', 'runway', 'columbia', 'metropolitan', 'airport', 'maingear', 'tyre', 'badly', 'underinflated', 'burst', 'takeoff', 'roll', 'although', 'jet', 'beyond', 'decision', 'speed', 'crew', 'attempt', 'abort', 'although', 'crew', 'deployed', 'thrustreversers', 'landinggear', 'damage', 'interfere', 'airground', 'system', 'logic', 'cause', 'uncommanded', 'stow', 'reversers', 'deployment', 'effectively', 'result', 'thrust', 'engine', 'accelerate', 'forward', 'learjet', 'overran', 'destroyed', 'fire', 'fatally', 'injure', 'pilot', 'passenger', 'directive', 'effective', 'june', 'u', 'faa', 'order', 'installation', 'voicecommand', 'warn', 'system', 'mitigate', 'failure', 'reverser', 'system', 'alert', 'crew', 'say', 'modification', 'need', 'carry', 'within', 'service', 'national', 'transportation', 'safety', 'board', 'issue', 'recommendation', 'july', 'month', 'september', 'accident', 'learjet', 'install', 'improve', 'aural', 'visual', 'cue', 'allow', 'pilot', 'recognise', 'inadvertent', 'reverser', 'stowage', 'despite', 'decade', 'passing', 'since', 'accident', 'recommendation', 'faa', 'decline', 'ntsb', 'request', 'shorten', 'compliance', 'faa', 'say', 'consider', 'urgency', 'unsafe', 'condition', 'practical', 'aspect', 'achieve', 'modification', 'within', 'period', 'aligns', 'operator', 'normal', 'maintenance', 'schedule', 'reject', 'request', 'separate', 'commenter', 'withdraw', 'directive', 'reason', 'design', 'move', 'away', 'use', 'multitude', 'aural', 'warning', 'faa', 'say', 'change', 'incorporates', 'direct', 'aural', 'voice', 'command', 'rapid', 'effective', 'response', 'prevent', 'scenario', 'similar', 'columbia', 'learjet', 'accident', 'investigator', 'criticise', 'learjet', 'faa', 'safety', 'analysis', 'decision', 'certify', 'type', 'standard', 'apply', 'original', 'learjet', 'model', 'decision', 'allow', 'deficiency', 'likely', 'present', 'update', 'regulation', 'apply', 'inquiry', 'express', 'concern', 'modification', 'introduce', 'previous', 'thrustreverser', 'accident', 'occur', 'learjet', 'land', 'troy', 'alabama', 'january', 'found', 'learjet', 'analysis', 'faa', 'review', 'modification', 'inadequate', 'address', 'design', 'deficiency', 'point', 'crew', 'procedure', 'rather', 'design', 'change', 'initially', 'introduce', 'mitigate', 'serious', 'hazard', 'uncommanded', 'forward', 'thrust', 'subsequent', 'supplementary', 'design', 'change', 'fail', 'address', 'problem']"
"India will restart international flights only once its domestic traffic reaches 50-60% of pre-Covid-19 levels, and that other countries loosen travel restrictions, India's civil aviation minister has said. “We can start regular international flights when our domestic traffic reaches about 50-60%, [and] other countries open up to international traffic without present conditionalities,” said Hardeep Singh Puri in a 21 June tweet. “Once the situation evolves in that direction we will consider a calibrated opening.” The Indian government currently restricts airlines to operating at up to 30% of pre-pandemic capacity. In a CNBC-TV18 interview that was published on 15 June, Indian budget carrier IndiGo's chief executive Ronojoy Dutta urged the government to “move that 30% cap up to 50%”. He added that it is “time to reduce the international restrictions”.

"Surveillance video footage has emerged appearing to show ground personnel vainly attempting to physically stop a Bombardier Q400 from rolling across an apron in Aberdeen, before the turboprop struck a parked regional jet. The former Flybe aircraft (G-JECK), apparently not under power and with its forward passenger airstair open, was captured rolling across the intersection of taxiways B and D on 16 June.  It headed south-east towards parking stand 11, at the north end of the terminal building, where a Loganair Embraer ERJ-145 (G-SAJS) was positioned, and the Q400's fuselage crown became wedged under the ERJ's right-hand engine, lifting the jet's main landing-gear off the apron. The ERJ was unoccupied at the time. Surveillance video circulating on social media shows the Q400 travelling unpowered across the apron, while attended by at least five ground personnel. Three of them are seen around the right-hand main landing-gear, while a fourth appears to try stopping the roll by bracing against the left-hand main gear. A fifth, who was inside the aircraft, jumps from the airstair and briefly attempts to take over from the person pushing against the left gear assembly, before running instead to the front of the aircraft to join a worker from the right-hand side in trying to push against the nose. None of the efforts succeed and all the ground staff quickly move clear of the aircraft as the collision becomes inevitable. No-one was injured during the event. The Air Accidents Investigation Branch was subsequently informed. The reasons for the Q400's movement have yet to be determined. Meteorological data for Aberdeen around the time of the accident indicate winds from the south-east, against the aircraft's direction of travel. Regional carrier Flybe collapsed in early March. The Q400 involved, according to Cirium fleets data, belongs to lessor Nordic Aviation Capital.

"Mexican flag carrier Aeromexico says it has no plans to file for bankruptcy, but that it is “evaluating alternatives to move towards a better financial position” after the global coronavirus pandemic decimated its liquidity. The public statement on 19 June comes in response to media reports earlier in the day that said the airline is mulling filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in order to restructure its debt after much of commercial passenger aviation was grounded in the past weeks. Aeromexico says it will not file for bankruptcy “The Company hereby informs that it has not initiated, nor has it made the decision to initiate, a restructuring procedure under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code,” the company says. “We are currently identifying additional sources of financing to strengthen operating cash flows,” it says. ”We are also analyzing different alternatives to successfully achieve, in the short and medium term, an orderly restructuring of financial commitments, without affecting or disrupting operations.” Latin American carriers are struggling as the region's governments have been much slower to respond with support for the air transport industry than in other parts of the world, such as North America and Europe. Billion-dollar aid packages in those regions have helped airlines stay afloat, at least temporarily, and reorganise their operations after passenger demand dropped off sharply when the coronavirus exploded into a global pandemic earlier this year. Chile's LATAM and Colombia's Avianca both filed for bankruptcy protection in May in order to shield their businesses from creditors. The airlines say they want to make sure they are able to restart operations smoothly when passenger demand returns and when travel restrictions are lifted. Commercial aviation trade organization IATA has repeatedly criticized Latin American governments' sluggish response to their aviation industries, and has strongly urged them to intervene on behalf of the sector's 7.2 million jobs across the region. In May, the body, which represents 290 airlines worldwide, said the goverments had provided less than 1% of the airlines' 2019 operating revenue in financial aid, making it the least-supportive region in the world. But giving governmet assistance to private companies in countries whose populations are already suffering from economic hardship is a difficult political proposition for many Latin American nations, even though air travel has been able to bridge vast distances across the continent where ground-based transportation networks, infrastructures and systems are sometimes unreliable. Air traffic fell by about 96% in Latin America and the Caribbean as the coronavirus pandemic reached its peak in April, and has yet to make any significant steps toward recovery. While most countries begin to lift restrictions in the coming weeks, Colombia and Argentina expect to have lockdowns in place through the end of August.",6,34,9.0,0.2521,"industry, crisis, demand, coronavirus, global, iata, market, level, cargo, expect","['mexican', 'flag', 'carrier', 'aeromexico', 'say', 'plan', 'file', 'bankruptcy', 'evaluate', 'alternative', 'move', 'towards', 'well', 'financial', 'position', 'global', 'coronavirus', 'pandemic', 'decimate', 'liquidity', 'public', 'statement', 'june', 'come', 'response', 'medium', 'report', 'earlier', 'day', 'say', 'mull', 'filing', 'chapter', 'bankruptcy', 'protection', 'order', 'restructure', 'debt', 'much', 'commercial', 'passenger', 'ground', 'past', 'week', 'aeromexico', 'say', 'file', 'bankruptcy', 'hereby', 'informs', 'initiate', 'make', 'decision', 'initiate', 'restructuring', 'procedure', 'chapter', 'united', 'state', 'bankruptcy', 'code', 'say', 'currently', 'identify', 'additional', 'source', 'financing', 'strengthen', 'operating', 'cash', 'flow', 'say', 'analyze', 'different', 'alternative', 'successfully', 'achieve', 'short', 'medium', 'term', 'orderly', 'restructuring', 'financial', 'commitment', 'without', 'affect', 'disrupt', 'latin', 'american', 'carrier', 'struggle', 'region', 'government', 'much', 'slow', 'respond', 'support', 'transport', 'industry', 'part', 'world', 'north', 'america', 'europe', 'billiondollar', 'aid', 'package', 'region', 'help', 'stay', 'afloat', 'least', 'temporarily', 'reorganise', 'operation', 'passenger', 'demand', 'drop', 'sharply', 'coronavirus', 'explode', 'global', 'pandemic', 'earlier', 'chile', 'latam', 'colombia', 'avianca', 'file', 'bankruptcy', 'protection', 'may', 'order', 'shield', 'business', 'creditor', 'say', 'want', 'make', 'sure', 'able', 'restart', 'operation', 'smoothly', 'passenger', 'demand', 'return', 'travel', 'restriction', 'lift', 'commercial', 'trade', 'organization', 'iata', 'repeatedly', 'criticize', 'latin', 'american', 'government', 'sluggish', 'response', 'industry', 'strongly', 'urge', 'intervene', 'behalf', 'sector', 'job', 'across', 'region', 'may', 'body', 'represent', 'worldwide', 'say', 'goverments', 'provide', 'less', 'operating', 'revenue', 'financial', 'aid', 'make', 'leastsupportive', 'region', 'world', 'give', 'governmet', 'assistance', 'private', 'country', 'whose', 'population', 'already', 'suffer', 'economic', 'hardship', 'difficult', 'political', 'proposition', 'many', 'latin', 'american', 'nation', 'even', 'though', 'travel', 'able', 'bridge', 'vast', 'distance', 'across', 'continent', 'groundbased', 'transportation', 'network', 'infrastructure', 'system', 'sometimes', 'unreliable', 'traffic', 'fell', 'latin', 'america', 'caribbean', 'coronavirus', 'pandemic', 'reach', 'peak', 'april', 'yet', 'make', 'significant', 'step', 'toward', 'recovery', 'country', 'begin', 'lift', 'restriction', 'come', 'week', 'colombia', 'argentina', 'expect', 'lockdown', 'place', 'end', 'august']"
"Irish carrier Aer Lingus is warning it expects to cut up to 500 jobs citing the ”catastrophic effect” the coronavirus crisis is having on the aviation industry. The IAG-owned carrier has issued a formal notification to the Irish employment minister regarding proposed redundancies. ”Aer Lingus has informed the minister that headcount reductions of up to 500 employees across the business are anticipated,” the airline says in a statement. ”Aer Lingus is now commencing the required consultation process with employee representative organisations.” The Irish carrier says it is operating less than 5% of its normal schedule and has no certainty regarding the restoration of services or the subsequent demand for air travel. But it also hit out at quarantine measures in Ireland. ”The situation is exacerbated in Ireland by the 14-day quarantine requirement for arriving passengers and travel advisories which advise against all non-essential travel,” the airline says. ”Ireland has failed to take steps that other European [Union] member states have taken – they have progressively restored transport services and connectivity in response to a European Commission invitation to do so,” the airline says. The European Commission earlier this month recommended all Schengen member and associated states lift internal border controls as of 15 June.

"Israeli flag-carrier El Al has put forward amendments to a proposed funding mechanism for the troubled airline, but insists the government has not rejected its basic propositions. El Al had been trying to negotiate a $400 million loan while the finance ministry had countered with an alternative, through which the airline would take a reduced loan of $250 million and raise the remaining capital through a share offer. The ministry had proposed that the government buy any outstanding shares not taken up by investors – a measure which potentially could have given it a 60% share of El Al, effectively returning it to state ownership. El Al says the ministry has “not announced the rejection” of its proposals, but the airline put forward suggestions on 18 June for “adjustments”, it says, in order to “address difficulties” which El Al sees in the ministry's idea for a combined loan and share package. It adds that it plans to “continue discussions” with the ministry on the matter. While El Al has not specified the nature of the adjustments, Israeli publication Globes says the airline is concerned over the time needed to arrange a share issue and the effects on its private shareholders' stakes, and is seeking a different form of financing.

"European airlines can avoid paying delay compensation to passengers as a result of disruption from an unruly passenger during flight, according to a preliminary court ruling. This also applies if there is a direct causal link between the initial disruption and a subsequent delay to the same aircraft operating the return service. The preliminary judgement – on behalf of a Lisbon court – has been drawn up by the European Court of Justice following a case involving a TAP Portugal service operating from Lisbon to Fortaleza in August 2017. During the flight, the judgement states, a passenger had bitten and assaulted other passengers and cabin crew, and the aircraft diverted to Las Palmas in the Canary Islands. This meant the return service to Lisbon was delayed and a passenger on that flight missed a connection at Lisbon for an onward flight to Oslo. TAP refused to pay a compensation claim – citing “extraordinary circumstances” and pointing out that sending another aircraft could not have remedied the delay – and the passenger brought a case against the airline in a Lisbon district court. In a clarification ruling on the airline's potential liability, the European Court of Justice says an unruly passenger counts as “extraordinary circumstances” – unless the airline contributed to the occurrence of the behaviour or failed to take appropriate measures following sufficient warning signs. The ruling adds that carriers “may rely” on this defence if the extraordinary circumstance directly causes the delay or cancellation of a subsequent flight by the same aircraft. But it also accepts that the passenger who brought the case was only flown from Lisbon to Oslo the following day, on the next available TAP flight. While airlines can refuse compensation if they take reasonable measures to rectify a passenger's delay, the court ruling points out that the carrier cannot simply offer to put the passenger on its next scheduled flight. It states that airlines must seek alternative flights, including indirect services and those operated by other carriers or alliances, if such flights would reduce the passenger's delay in arriving at their destination – unless such re-routing involves “intolerable sacrifice” by the airline.",6,37,4.0,0.2477,"airport, fleet, service, data, carrier, operation, passenger, number, operate, operator","['european', 'avoid', 'pay', 'delay', 'compensation', 'passenger', 'result', 'disruption', 'unruly', 'passenger', 'accord', 'preliminary', 'court', 'ruling', 'applies', 'direct', 'causal', 'link', 'initial', 'disruption', 'subsequent', 'delay', 'operating', 'return', 'service', 'preliminary', 'judgement', 'behalf', 'lisbon', 'court', 'drawn', 'european', 'court', 'justice', 'follow', 'case', 'involve', 'tap', 'portugal', 'service', 'operating', 'lisbon', 'fortaleza', 'august', 'judgement', 'state', 'passenger', 'bitten', 'assault', 'passenger', 'cabin', 'crew', 'divert', 'la', 'palmas', 'canary', 'island', 'meant', 'return', 'service', 'lisbon', 'delayed', 'passenger', 'miss', 'connection', 'lisbon', 'onward', 'oslo', 'tap', 'refuse', 'pay', 'compensation', 'claim', 'cite', 'extraordinary', 'circumstance', 'point', 'send', 'another', 'remedied', 'delay', 'passenger', 'brought', 'case', 'lisbon', 'district', 'court', 'clarification', 'ruling', 'potential', 'liability', 'european', 'court', 'justice', 'say', 'unruly', 'passenger', 'count', 'extraordinary', 'circumstance', 'unless', 'contribute', 'occurrence', 'behaviour', 'fail', 'take', 'appropriate', 'measure', 'follow', 'sufficient', 'warn', 'sign', 'ruling', 'add', 'carrier', 'may', 'rely', 'defence', 'extraordinary', 'circumstance', 'directly', 'cause', 'delay', 'cancellation', 'subsequent', 'accepts', 'passenger', 'brought', 'case', 'flown', 'lisbon', 'oslo', 'follow', 'day', 'next', 'available', 'tap', 'refuse', 'compensation', 'take', 'reasonable', 'measure', 'rectify', 'passenger', 'delay', 'court', 'ruling', 'point', 'carrier', 'simply', 'offer', 'put', 'passenger', 'next', 'schedule', 'state', 'must', 'seek', 'alternative', 'include', 'indirect', 'service', 'operate', 'carrier', 'alliance', 'reduce', 'passenger', 'delay', 'arrive', 'destination', 'unless', 'rerouting', 'involves', 'intolerable', 'sacrifice']"
"Textron Inc., the parent company of the Wichita-based airframer Textron Aviation and helicopter manufacturer Bell, says it is eliminating 1,950 jobs as part of a restructuring programme made necessary by the effects of the global coronavirus pandemic. The company says in a filing with the securities and exchange commission on 18 June that it will reduce its operating expenses by between $110 million and $130 million through “headcount reductions, facility consolidations and other actions in response to the economic challenges and uncertainty resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic”. The restructuring project impacts the TRU Simulation + Training business within Textron Systems, as well as the Textron Aviation and Industrial segments. The cuts represent 6% of the firm's total workforce. It is unclear how many of the job cuts will be at Textron Aviation, the parent of Cessna and Beechcraft, which employs more than 12,000 workers altogether, most of them in the central US state of Kansas. “In the Textron Aviation segment, with lower volumes expected in the near term, we will initiate indirect and direct workforce reductions as we align our cost structure and production levels with demand,” the filing reads. Textron did not disclose any impact to Bell, which makes civil and military helicopters. The company could not be immediately reached for additional comment. Earlier in the day, Textron Aviation chief executive Ron Draper told an FAA online forum that the company had seen business screech to a halt early in the crisis, but that there are now “signs for optimism” that the company and the industry are on their way to recovery. In April, Textron Aviation had said its first-quarter profit tumbled 97% year-on-year to $3 million due largely to an idle factory floor and sagging aircraft sales amid the global coronavirus outbreak. In late March, the company had temporarily shuttered its manufacturing facilities and furloughed a number of US employees. It said it had delivered far fewer aircraft in the first three months of 2020 compared to the same period a year ago. Just a few weeks later Textron's Cessna subsidiary launched the flight test programme for its twin-engined turboprop called the SkyCourier.

"The Federal Aviation Administration will likely extend its medical certificate exception for an unspecificed amount of time, after government coronavirus lockdown orders made it difficult for pilots to get appointments with certified Aviation Medical Examiners. In March, the US regulator had released a policy update saying that for three months it would not take enforcement action against pilots flying with an expired medical certificate. That was set to end on 30 June and applied only to pilots whose medical certificates expired between 31 March and 30 June.  FAA to extend medical exceptions for pilots Now, the organization says it will likely extend that deadline as the pandemic has dragged on. “There is an extension in the works,” FAA deputy administrator Dan Elwell tells an online FAA forum on 18 June. He did not say for how long. “We are hoping that very soon we will be unravelling those extensions and getting people back, getting their currency, getting their medicals,” he added. But for the moment, he says, the agency recognises it would be almost impossible for pilots to catch up on these requirements between now and the end of this month. Earlier this year, trade groups like Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association (AOPA) and Airlines for America (A4A) had urged the FAA to grant regulatory flexibility, saying the pandemic has made complying with some requirements difficult, hazardous and in some cases impossible.

"The US Navy (USN) recently completed a critical design review of Northrop Grumman's Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile-Extended Range (AARGM-ER), a new air-launched weapon intended to destroy enemy radar and communications systems. The service completed design verification tests of the AARGM-ER rocket motor and warhead, in addition to critical design review of subsystems and system-level performance, Northrop said on 18 June. “Rocket motor design verification tests represented a significant knowledge point and milestone for engineering and manufacturing development,” says Gordon Turner, vice-president of advanced weapons with Northrop. “These tests were important to informing the critical design review and verifying performance of the missile. With our government partners, we are aggressively focused on achieving speed-to-fleet while holding to programme cost objectives.” To test propulsion performance, the rocket motor was fired in extreme cold and hot temperatures. The warhead was also tested to demonstrate “lethality performance”, says Northrop. The AARGM-ER is an extended-range version of the USN's current AARGM weapon, which is in full-rate production. The –ER variant borrows many components of the classic AARGM, but adds a new rocket motor for increased range and a new warhead for increased destruction. For lift, it has a short strake along its length, instead of its predecessor's mid-body wings. As a standoff weapon, which can be launched by aircraft beyond the reach of enemy surface-to-air missiles, the missile's exact range is classified. Anti-radiation missiles are designed to destroy enemy radar, jammers and radio transmitters – to blind an adversary, preventing them from tracking and downing US aircraft. The missiles would be fired early in a conflict, clearing the way for waves of fighters and bombers. AARGM-ER is to be integrated on the USN's Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and EA-18G Growler fleets.

"IAG's short-haul division of its budget airline Level is filing for insolvency, the Austrian-based carrier has disclosed. Branded as Level Europe, the division is operated by Anisec Luftfahrt. It says it will enter insolvency on 18 June, with all flights having been grounded since March. The business has ceased trading with “immediate effect”, it adds. Level originated as a long-haul operation out of Spain, but IAG subsequently opted to extend the Level brand to short-haul services from Vienna. The company also chose to establish another Level Europe short-haul base in Amsterdam last year. “Level Europe is unfortunately not able to arrange alternative flights for passengers,” the company states. The carrier was using a fleet of about half a dozen Airbus A321s and A320s, with services covering European, Mediterranean and north African destinations. Level Europe has informed employees, suppliers and creditors that an administrator is being appointed and further details will be released by 24 June.",6,41,8.0,0.1857,"government, uk, carrier, business, state, share, south, airway, financial, plan","['iag', 'shorthaul', 'division', 'budget', 'level', 'filing', 'insolvency', 'austrianbased', 'carrier', 'disclose', 'brand', 'level', 'europe', 'division', 'operate', 'anisec', 'luftfahrt', 'say', 'enter', 'insolvency', 'june', 'ground', 'since', 'march', 'business', 'cease', 'trading', 'immediate', 'effect', 'add', 'level', 'originate', 'longhaul', 'operation', 'spain', 'iag', 'subsequently', 'opt', 'extend', 'level', 'brand', 'shorthaul', 'service', 'vienna', 'chose', 'establish', 'another', 'level', 'europe', 'shorthaul', 'base', 'amsterdam', 'level', 'europe', 'unfortunately', 'able', 'arrange', 'alternative', 'passenger', 'state', 'carrier', 'use', 'fleet', 'half', 'dozen', 'service', 'cover', 'european', 'mediterranean', 'north', 'african', 'destination', 'level', 'europe', 'inform', 'employee', 'supplier', 'creditor', 'administrator', 'appoint', 'far', 'detail', 'release', 'june']"
"Provisional liquidators of South African regional carrier SA Express are attempting to find a buyer for the airline, claiming that they are engaging with six or seven parties which have expressed interest in the company. Their effort follows court approval on 15 June to extend their powers, in order to explore the possibility of attracting investment in the airline. Final liquidation orders for SA Express – which would have simply resulted in the dismantling of the company and disposal of its assets – have been postponed until 6 September, giving the provisional liquidators a three-month window to secure a deal. One of the liquidators, Aviwe Ntandazo Ndyamara, disclosed the situation as he belatedly testified to the parliamentary standing committee on public accounts on 17 June. The liquidators had previously been due to appear before the committee but failed to show – apparently due to a communication mix-up – and the committee chair, Mkhuleko Hlengwa, had threatened to subpoena them. Ndyamara stressed that there had been “no intention” to undermine the process and that the liquidators had wanted to provide a proper update on the SA Express situation. He told the committee that interest in the airline had emerged from several potential investors. “There are six interested – in fact, from this morning, there's about seven interested parties that we're currently engaging,” said Ndyamara. “The next route for us is to proceed with an investment or a sales process – a transparent process where we either attract an investor or, alternatively, we pursue the disposal of the assets of the airline in order to satisfy creditors' claims.” While a final liquidation order has been pushed back, Ndyamara pointed out that the airline holds two licences which are scheduled to expire on 31 July. It also has an aviation security training organisation approval which expires on 31 December. He says the liquidators aim to engage a sale or investment process before the expirations. The situation is further complicated by SA Express aircraft and engine lease agreements amounting to R22.5 million per month, plus monthly office and hangar leases of R2.2 million. Ndyamara says that these lease agreements are “onerous” and “immediate consideration” must be given to their termination. But he adds that this could have an impact on the licences. “This is critical for us,” he says. SA Express was placed under business rescue proceedings on 6 February and then into provisional liquidation on 28 April, with Ndyamara and other provisional liquidators appointed on 13 May. Ndyamara says the team's priority was to reduce the costly R1.8 billion ($104 million) security bond put in place to protect the company's assets. This involved carrying out an independent market assessment, which evaluated the assets at R103-120 million and reduced the bond to R113 million. SA Express had around R800,000 in cash reserves in its bank accounts, which was ring-fenced. Ndyamara says that, at the time of the provision liquidation order on 28 April, employee salaries for March and April were still outstanding. Employee contracts were immediately suspended as a result of the order. Outstanding remuneration, says Ndyamara, will be dealt with as claims against the company. While employees have special preference under insolvency law, however, they will only be paid after secured creditors' claims have been settled. “At this stage it is unclear if there will be residue for payment of the employee claims,” says Ndyamara. Chair Mkhuleko Hlengwa says that, following the briefing on SA Express and the previous update on South African Airways' business rescue, the committee members have resolved to schedule hearings with former boards of directors of state-owned entities. He says the briefing suggest that the collapse of SAA and SA Express might have occurred, in part, as the result of “lack of governance”. “Questions were raised about the role played by the former boards of directors in ensuring proper governance and effective consequence management at state-owned companies,” he adds. Committee members also plan a hearing with the government's department of public enterprises to “ascertain the loopholes” which, Hlengwa says, have contributed to “failure of effective oversight” of these firms. “[The committee] is also concerned with the movement of senior executives from one entity to another under the department's watch and wants the department to justify these recruitment processes,” he adds. Representatives of South Africa's treasury and anti-corruption law-enforcement agencies will similarly be invited to brief the committee, as part of continuing probes into alleged cases of financial mismanagement.",6,42,8.0,0.5106,"government, uk, carrier, business, state, share, south, airway, financial, plan","['provisional', 'liquidator', 'south', 'african', 'regional', 'carrier', 'sa', 'express', 'attempt', 'find', 'buyer', 'claim', 'engage', 'party', 'express', 'interest', 'effort', 'follow', 'court', 'approval', 'june', 'extend', 'power', 'order', 'explore', 'possibility', 'attract', 'investment', 'final', 'liquidation', 'order', 'sa', 'express', 'simply', 'result', 'dismantle', 'disposal', 'asset', 'postpone', 'september', 'give', 'provisional', 'liquidator', 'threemonth', 'window', 'secure', 'deal', 'liquidator', 'aviwe', 'ntandazo', 'ndyamara', 'disclose', 'situation', 'belatedly', 'testify', 'parliamentary', 'stand', 'committee', 'public', 'account', 'june', 'liquidator', 'previously', 'due', 'appear', 'committee', 'fail', 'apparently', 'due', 'communication', 'mixup', 'committee', 'chair', 'mkhuleko', 'hlengwa', 'threaten', 'subpoena', 'ndyamara', 'stress', 'intention', 'undermine', 'process', 'liquidator', 'want', 'provide', 'proper', 'update', 'sa', 'express', 'situation', 'told', 'committee', 'interest', 'emerge', 'several', 'potential', 'investor', 'interested', 'fact', 'morning', 'interested', 'party', 'currently', 'engage', 'say', 'ndyamara', 'next', 'route', 'u', 'proceed', 'investment', 'sale', 'process', 'transparent', 'process', 'either', 'attract', 'investor', 'alternatively', 'pursue', 'disposal', 'asset', 'order', 'satisfy', 'creditor', 'final', 'liquidation', 'order', 'push', 'back', 'ndyamara', 'point', 'hold', 'licence', 'schedule', 'expire', 'july', 'security', 'training', 'organisation', 'approval', 'expires', 'december', 'say', 'liquidator', 'aim', 'engage', 'sale', 'investment', 'process', 'expiration', 'situation', 'far', 'complicate', 'sa', 'express', 'engine', 'lease', 'agreement', 'amount', 'per', 'month', 'plus', 'monthly', 'office', 'hangar', 'lease', 'ndyamara', 'say', 'lease', 'agreement', 'onerous', 'immediate', 'consideration', 'must', 'give', 'termination', 'add', 'impact', 'licence', 'critical', 'u', 'say', 'sa', 'express', 'place', 'business', 'rescue', 'proceeding', 'february', 'provisional', 'liquidation', 'april', 'ndyamara', 'provisional', 'liquidator', 'appoint', 'may', 'ndyamara', 'say', 'team', 'priority', 'reduce', 'costly', 'security', 'bond', 'put', 'place', 'protect', 'asset', 'involve', 'carry', 'independent', 'market', 'assessment', 'evaluate', 'asset', 'reduce', 'bond', 'sa', 'express', 'around', 'cash', 'reserve', 'bank', 'account', 'ringfenced', 'ndyamara', 'say', 'provision', 'liquidation', 'order', 'april', 'employee', 'salary', 'march', 'april', 'still', 'outstanding', 'employee', 'contract', 'immediately', 'suspend', 'result', 'order', 'outstanding', 'remuneration', 'say', 'ndyamara', 'dealt', 'claim', 'employee', 'special', 'preference', 'insolvency', 'law', 'however', 'paid', 'secure', 'creditor', 'claim', 'settle', 'stage', 'unclear', 'residue', 'payment', 'employee', 'claim', 'say', 'ndyamara', 'chair', 'mkhuleko', 'hlengwa', 'say', 'follow', 'briefing', 'sa', 'express', 'previous', 'update', 'south', 'african', 'airway', 'business', 'rescue', 'committee', 'member', 'resolve', 'schedule', 'hearing', 'former', 'board', 'director', 'stateowned', 'entity', 'say', 'briefing', 'suggest', 'collapse', 'saa', 'sa', 'express', 'might', 'occur', 'part', 'result', 'lack', 'governance', 'question', 'raise', 'role', 'played', 'former', 'board', 'director', 'ensure', 'proper', 'governance', 'effective', 'consequence', 'management', 'stateowned', 'add', 'committee', 'member', 'plan', 'hearing', 'government', 'department', 'public', 'enterprise', 'ascertain', 'loophole', 'hlengwa', 'say', 'contribute', 'failure', 'effective', 'oversight', 'firm', 'committee', 'concerned', 'movement', 'senior', 'executive', 'entity', 'another', 'department', 'watch', 'want', 'department', 'justify', 'recruitment', 'process', 'add', 'representative', 'south', 'africa', 'treasury', 'anticorruption', 'lawenforcement', 'agency', 'similarly', 'invite', 'brief', 'committee', 'part', 'continue', 'probe', 'allege', 'case', 'financial', 'mismanagement']"

"Sikorsky will formally propose its S-70i Armed Black Hawk for a Philippine air force attack helicopter requirement. The proposal for six helicopters would build on Manila's order for 16 S-70is in a combat utility configuration, says Jon Rudy, regional executive at Sikorsky, a unit of Lockheed Martin. The 16 S-70is are being produced at the company's PZL Mielec unit in Poland. Deliveries for the order, which Sikorsky sealed in early 2019, will commence in the fourth quarter of this year and will be completed in 2021. “We believe that Armed Black Hawk is compelling for the Philippines air force...in that it is going to have 100% baseline commonality with their combat utility helicopters,” says Rudy. “So you can imagine the economies that are associated with support, training and logistics.” As with Manila's baseline S-70is (also designated as UH-60s) the Armed Black Hawks would be produced at PZL Mielec. If necessary, the armed version can be reconfigured for other missions, such as transport and humanitarian relief. The company has already mooted the proposal with Manila. Should the Armed Black Hawk be selected, Rudy says the first example could be delivered in June 2022, with the balance in 2023. Joe Palumbo, UH-60 programme director at Sikorsky, adds that the helmet-based targeting system available for Armed Black Hawk offers pilots the ability to engage targets precisely. A Sikorsky promotional video for the Armed Black Hawk Manila's dearth of precision strike capabilities was highlighted during its five-month battle against Islamic militants in the town of Marawi in 2017. A lack of precision munitions slowed the army's campaign to retake the town, resulting in an extended campaign and significant collateral damage. Sikorsky will offer the Armed Black Hawk on a direct commercial sales basis. The other two US helicopters in contention, the Bell AH-1Z Zulu and Boeing AH-64E Apache, are being offered under Washington's Foreign Military Sale (FMS) mechanism. Rudy claims that the Armed Black Hawk will be less costly to procure and operate than dedicated attack helicopters, and be within Manila's budget. Media reports from the Philippines suggest the budget for the requirement is in the region of $250-265 million. In May, a US Defense Security Cooperation Agency release indicated that the cost of six AH-64Es and related equipment and services would be $1.5 billion, while six AH-1Zs would cost $450 million. Both FMS packages contained additional equipment, weapons, spares, support equipment, and other products and services. The AH-64E package placed a heavy emphasis on precision weapons. Manila has also flirted with the Turkish Aerospace T129 ATAK. It is understood, however, that US government export restrictions related to the type's US-built LHTEC T800 engines would complicate any T129 buy. The Armed Black Hawk can carry the same combat load as an Apache, with up to 16 Lockheed AGM-114 Hellfire air-to-surface missiles, 70mm rockets (guided or unguided) and forward-firing guns. Rudy says Sikorsky has also discussed the Armed Black Hawk with several other governments in the Asia-Pacific region.",6,44,1.0,0.4789,"test, force, helicopter, fire, system, service, attack, design, usaf, missile","['sikorsky', 'formally', 'propose', 'arm', 'black', 'hawk', 'philippine', 'force', 'attack', 'helicopter', 'requirement', 'proposal', 'helicopter', 'build', 'manila', 'order', 'combat', 'utility', 'configuration', 'say', 'jon', 'rudy', 'regional', 'executive', 'sikorsky', 'unit', 'lockheed', 'martin', 'produce', 'pzl', 'mielec', 'unit', 'poland', 'delivery', 'order', 'sikorsky', 'seal', 'early', 'commence', 'fourth', 'quarter', 'complete', 'believe', 'arm', 'black', 'hawk', 'compelling', 'philippine', 'force', 'go', 'baseline', 'commonality', 'combat', 'utility', 'helicopter', 'say', 'rudy', 'imagine', 'economy', 'associate', 'support', 'training', 'manila', 'baseline', 'designate', 'arm', 'black', 'hawk', 'produce', 'pzl', 'mielec', 'necessary', 'arm', 'version', 'reconfigured', 'mission', 'transport', 'humanitarian', 'relief', 'already', 'moot', 'proposal', 'manila', 'arm', 'black', 'hawk', 'select', 'rudy', 'say', 'example', 'deliver', 'june', 'balance', 'joe', 'palumbo', 'programme', 'director', 'sikorsky', 'add', 'helmetbased', 'target', 'system', 'available', 'arm', 'black', 'hawk', 'offer', 'pilot', 'ability', 'engage', 'target', 'precisely', 'sikorsky', 'promotional', 'video', 'arm', 'black', 'hawk', 'manila', 'dearth', 'precision', 'strike', 'capability', 'highlight', 'fivemonth', 'battle', 'islamic', 'militant', 'town', 'marawi', 'lack', 'precision', 'munition', 'slow', 'army', 'campaign', 'retake', 'town', 'result', 'extend', 'campaign', 'significant', 'collateral', 'damage', 'sikorsky', 'offer', 'arm', 'black', 'hawk', 'direct', 'commercial', 'sale', 'basis', 'u', 'helicopter', 'contention', 'bell', 'zulu', 'apache', 'offer', 'washington', 'foreign', 'military', 'sale', 'fm', 'mechanism', 'rudy', 'claim', 'arm', 'black', 'hawk', 'less', 'costly', 'procure', 'operate', 'dedicate', 'attack', 'helicopter', 'within', 'manila', 'budget', 'medium', 'report', 'philippine', 'suggest', 'budget', 'requirement', 'region', 'may', 'u', 'defense', 'security', 'cooperation', 'agency', 'release', 'indicate', 'cost', 'related', 'equipment', 'service', 'cost', 'fm', 'package', 'contain', 'additional', 'equipment', 'weapon', 'spare', 'support', 'equipment', 'product', 'service', 'package', 'place', 'heavy', 'emphasis', 'precision', 'weapon', 'manila', 'flirt', 'turkish', 'atak', 'understood', 'however', 'u', 'government', 'export', 'restriction', 'related', 'type', 'usbuilt', 'lhtec', 'engine', 'complicate', 'buy', 'arm', 'black', 'hawk', 'carry', 'combat', 'load', 'apache', 'lockheed', 'hellfire', 'airtosurface', 'missile', 'rocket', 'guide', 'unguided', 'forwardfiring', 'gun', 'rudy', 'say', 'sikorsky', 'discuss', 'arm', 'black', 'hawk', 'several', 'government', 'asiapacific', 'region']"
"The US Department of Transportation (DOT) has fined Panama-headquartered Copa Airlines $450,000 for “unlawfully transporting passengers” between the USA and Venezuela. A US order, imposed in May 2019, bars commercial air carriers from transporting passengers and cargo between the two countries. The rule was enacted due to “security concerns” and bolsters the US' simmering conflict with the socialist government of the South American country. Copa has permission to fly to several US airports under the condition that it does not offer any further connections to Venezuela. “An investigation by DOT's Office of Aviation Consumer Protection found that for nearly a month following the issuance of DOT's 2019 order, Copa sold more than 5,000 tickets for air travel between the United States and Venezuela and transported more than 15,000 passengers on these itineraries,” the DOT says on 17 June. The passengers traveled between 15 May and 11 June 2019. “By transporting passengers between the United States and Venezuela, Copa violated the conditions of its authority to operate and engaged in passenger operations to and from the United States without proper DOT authority,” it adds. The DOT's filing says Copa responded that it had sold these tickets unwillfully, that it understood “the seriousness of the matter” and cooperated fully. The airline also said it has “taken considerable and substantive steps to avoid future violations”. Half of the fine is to be paid within 120 days, and the other half will become due immediately if Copa repeats the violation within one year. Prior to the 15 May 2019 order, the FAA had banned US carriers and pilots from flying below 26,000ft over the country. An emergency NOTAM stated that the ban would be in place until further notice “due to increasing political instability and tensions in Venezuela and the associated inadvertent risk to flight operations.” Copa Airlines suspended most of its operations after the government of Panama imposed restrictions on international flights due to the global coronavirus pandemic. Before the crisis, however, the airline operated flights to 13 cities in the United States, including New York, San Francisco, Orlando and Washington, DC.",6,45,12.0,0.311,"travel, government, country, coronavirus, measure, restriction, passenger, state, march, canada","['u', 'department', 'transportation', 'dot', 'fin', 'panamaheadquartered', 'copa', 'unlawfully', 'transport', 'passenger', 'usa', 'venezuela', 'u', 'order', 'impose', 'may', 'bar', 'commercial', 'carrier', 'transport', 'passenger', 'cargo', 'country', 'rule', 'enact', 'due', 'security', 'concern', 'bolster', 'u', 'simmer', 'conflict', 'socialist', 'government', 'south', 'american', 'country', 'copa', 'permission', 'fly', 'several', 'u', 'airport', 'condition', 'offer', 'far', 'connection', 'venezuela', 'investigation', 'dot', 'office', 'consumer', 'protection', 'found', 'nearly', 'month', 'follow', 'issuance', 'dot', 'order', 'copa', 'sell', 'ticket', 'travel', 'united', 'state', 'venezuela', 'transport', 'passenger', 'itinerary', 'dot', 'say', 'june', 'passenger', 'travel', 'may', 'june', 'transport', 'passenger', 'united', 'state', 'venezuela', 'copa', 'violate', 'condition', 'authority', 'operate', 'engage', 'passenger', 'operation', 'united', 'state', 'without', 'proper', 'dot', 'authority', 'add', 'dot', 'filing', 'say', 'copa', 'respond', 'sell', 'ticket', 'unwillfully', 'understood', 'seriousness', 'matter', 'cooperate', 'fully', 'say', 'take', 'considerable', 'substantive', 'step', 'avoid', 'future', 'violation', 'half', 'fine', 'paid', 'within', 'day', 'half', 'become', 'due', 'immediately', 'copa', 'repeat', 'violation', 'within', 'prior', 'may', 'order', 'faa', 'ban', 'u', 'carrier', 'pilot', 'fly', 'country', 'emergency', 'notam', 'state', 'ban', 'place', 'far', 'notice', 'due', 'increase', 'political', 'instability', 'tension', 'venezuela', 'associate', 'inadvertent', 'risk', 'copa', 'suspend', 'operation', 'government', 'panama', 'impose', 'restriction', 'international', 'due', 'global', 'coronavirus', 'pandemic', 'crisis', 'however', 'operate', 'city', 'united', 'state', 'include', 'york', 'san', 'francisco', 'orlando', 'washington', 'dc']"
"South Africa's government has expressed doubts as to whether the long-awaited business rescue plan for South African Airways will meet its expectations for creating a viable and sustainable national carrier. Publication of the plan has also drawn condemnation from the opposition Democratic Alliance party, which says the strategy relies on a R32.65 billion ($1.9 billion) bailout from the government. The government's department of public enterprises points out that the rescue practitioners, who have overseen SAA's management since early December last year, have been granted a “substantial” period of time and “significant” resources to restructure the airline. “We will assess the plan which, we are concerned, might have not been adequately accomplished,” it states. SAA has been mired in a business rescue process for six months But the Democratic Alliance has dismissed the bailout as “ridiculous” and will urge finance minister Tito Mboweni to oppose it. It says the cash required over the next three years includes R16.4 billion for lenders, another R2.2 billion for personnel retrenchment, creditor payments of R2.3 billion, and R3.2 billion to address ticket claims. Mango Airlines, maintenance division SAA Technical, and catering operation Air Chefs account for another R2.1 billion. SAA trading losses will add a further R6.4 billion. The Democratic Alliance says it also plans to write to the competition regulator to request an investigation into the proposed bailout. “We are of the view that it violates the Competition Act, as the airline will get an unfair competitive advantage over the other South African airlines,” it adds. “Of the limited options left for SAA, another bailout must not be on the list.” It insists that liquidation of the carrier is the “only realistic option” rather than pouring further public funding into a “bankrupt black hole” that has “not contributed anything to our economy for 10 years”.",6,46,8.0,0.4974,"government, uk, carrier, business, state, share, south, airway, financial, plan","['south', 'africa', 'government', 'express', 'doubt', 'whether', 'longawaited', 'business', 'rescue', 'plan', 'south', 'african', 'airway', 'meet', 'expectation', 'create', 'viable', 'sustainable', 'national', 'carrier', 'publication', 'plan', 'drawn', 'condemnation', 'opposition', 'democratic', 'alliance', 'party', 'say', 'strategy', 'relies', 'bailout', 'government', 'government', 'department', 'public', 'enterprise', 'point', 'rescue', 'practitioner', 'overseen', 'saa', 'management', 'since', 'early', 'december', 'grant', 'substantial', 'period', 'significant', 'resource', 'restructure', 'ass', 'plan', 'concerned', 'might', 'adequately', 'accomplish', 'state', 'saa', 'mire', 'business', 'rescue', 'process', 'month', 'democratic', 'alliance', 'dismiss', 'bailout', 'ridiculous', 'urge', 'finance', 'minister', 'tito', 'mboweni', 'oppose', 'say', 'cash', 'require', 'next', 'include', 'lender', 'another', 'personnel', 'retrenchment', 'creditor', 'payment', 'address', 'ticket', 'claim', 'mango', 'maintenance', 'division', 'saa', 'technical', 'catering', 'operation', 'chef', 'account', 'another', 'saa', 'trading', 'loss', 'add', 'far', 'democratic', 'alliance', 'say', 'plan', 'write', 'competition', 'regulator', 'request', 'investigation', 'propose', 'bailout', 'view', 'violates', 'competition', 'act', 'get', 'unfair', 'competitive', 'advantage', 'south', 'african', 'add', 'limited', 'option', 'left', 'saa', 'another', 'bailout', 'must', 'insists', 'liquidation', 'carrier', 'realistic', 'option', 'rather', 'pour', 'far', 'public', 'funding', 'bankrupt', 'black', 'hole', 'contribute', 'anything', 'economy']"
"The Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) has lifted a grounding order on its Sikorsky CH-148 Cyclone maritime helicopter fleet, after ruling out mechanical failure as the cause of a recent crash. A Canadian CH-148 crashed into the Ionian Sea in good weather on 29 April, killing all six personnel aboard. “While the Directorate of Flight Safety investigation continues, information that the investigation uncovered to date – primarily from the Cyclone's flight data recorder – allowed the investigative team to replicate the conditions in the CH-148 Cyclone flight simulator and rule out any mechanical failure,” says Ottawa's Department of National Defence (DND). Examination of flight data has allowed the Canadian government to piece together the helicopter's last moments. “This revealed that the aircraft's flight director was set to hold a specific altitude and airspeed. Thus, during the complex manoeuvring turn to align with the ship, the pilot's inputs were significantly different from the autopilot settings and the aircraft did not respond in a way that the crew was expecting,” the DND says. “The investigative team has confirmed that this rare anomaly only occurred under a very specific and narrow set of circumstances. The crew would have had no previous exposure or experience on how to handle this situation.” In 2017, the air force's fleet of CH-148s was grounded for two months after Sikorsky discovered a software issue with the helicopters' flight control computers. The CH-148 is a military derivative of the Sikorsky S-92, a twin-engined medium-lift helicopter that is used widely in the oil and gas industry. Canada is set to receive 28 examples of the helicopter by 2021, according to Sikorsky. The helicopter is used mostly for anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare, as well as maritime search and rescue, and overland utility missions.",6,47,1.0,0.2739,"test, force, helicopter, fire, system, service, attack, design, usaf, missile","['royal', 'canadian', 'force', 'rcaf', 'lift', 'ground', 'order', 'sikorsky', 'cyclone', 'maritime', 'helicopter', 'fleet', 'ruling', 'mechanical', 'failure', 'cause', 'recent', 'crash', 'canadian', 'crashed', 'ionian', 'sea', 'good', 'weather', 'april', 'kill', 'personnel', 'aboard', 'directorate', 'safety', 'investigation', 'continue', 'information', 'investigation', 'uncovered', 'date', 'primarily', 'cyclone', 'data', 'recorder', 'allow', 'investigative', 'team', 'replicate', 'condition', 'cyclone', 'simulator', 'rule', 'mechanical', 'failure', 'say', 'ottawa', 'department', 'national', 'defence', 'dnd', 'examination', 'data', 'allow', 'canadian', 'government', 'piece', 'together', 'helicopter', 'moment', 'reveal', 'director', 'set', 'hold', 'specific', 'altitude', 'airspeed', 'thus', 'complex', 'manoeuvre', 'turn', 'align', 'ship', 'pilot', 'input', 'significantly', 'different', 'autopilot', 'setting', 'respond', 'way', 'crew', 'expect', 'dnd', 'say', 'investigative', 'team', 'confirm', 'rare', 'anomaly', 'occur', 'specific', 'narrow', 'set', 'circumstance', 'crew', 'previous', 'exposure', 'experience', 'handle', 'force', 'fleet', 'ground', 'month', 'sikorsky', 'discover', 'software', 'issue', 'control', 'computer', 'military', 'derivative', 'sikorsky', 'twinengined', 'mediumlift', 'helicopter', 'use', 'widely', 'oil', 'gas', 'industry', 'canada', 'set', 'receive', 'example', 'helicopter', 'accord', 'sikorsky', 'helicopter', 'use', 'mostly', 'antisubmarine', 'antisurface', 'warfare', 'well', 'maritime', 'search', 'rescue', 'overland', 'utility', 'mission']"
"Lawmakers lobbed harsh, pointed criticism at the head of the Federal Aviation Administration on 17 June, accusing the agency of stonewalling congressional investigations into the certification of the Boeing 737 Max. FAA administrator Steve Dickson denied his agency has not cooperated and pledged to work with Congress to improve aviation safety. Dickson also argued that improved certification can be best achieved with company-specific safety plans called “safety management systems” (SMS). He says the FAA will issue a rule requiring aerospace manufacturers have those plans, which are already required for airlines and are intended to embed a safety culture into organisations. Dickson does not say when such a rule might be issued. “I believe that the biggest thing that we can do is to implement safety management systems for manufacturers, and we are working on that right now,” Dickson tells the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation. “We plan to initiate rulemaking on that shortly.” During the hearing, lawmakers chastised Dickson for what they described as the FAA's failure to support the committee's investigation into the Max's certification. Committee chair Roger Wicker said the FAA failed to respond to multiple requests for information about the FAA's oversight of the Max certification. Regulators grounded the Max in March 2019 following two crashes that killed 346 people. “This record of delay and non-responsiveness clearly shows at best an unwillingness to cooperate in congressional oversight,” Wicker tells Dickson. “Your team at the FAA has deliberately attempted to keep us in the dark.” Senator Richard Blumenthal called the FAA “complicit in these crashes by failing to do more-diligent oversight.” Dickson shot back. “I vehemently disagree with your characterisation of my desire for transparency,” he told lawmakers. “We want to collaborate and work together with the committee to raise the bar on aviation safety.” “I believe it's inaccurate to portray the agency as unresponsive,” Dickson added, noting that the FAA is supporting several Max-related investigations. Dickson also reviewed steps that must be completed before the FAA clears the 737 Max to fly. Boeing has said it expects the type, which has been grounded since March 2019, will be cleared by the third quarter. Dickson provides no timeline. The FAA still must complete a flight test, and a Joint Operations Evaluation Board (JOEB) – a body composed of representatives from the FAA, other countries' regulators and pilots – must complete a pilot assessment. A Flight Standardisation Board will then release a public report addressing the JOEB's finding, Dickson says. A multi-agency Technical Advisory Board must also evaluate final Max design documents and the FAA must approve airlines' pilot training programmes. Lastly, the FAA will issue an airworthiness directive laying out actions airlines must take to return Max to the skies. Dickson, a pilot, will also fly the jet himself before signing off, he says. The 17 June hearing comes as the Senate pitches legislation intended to improve aviation safety and the FAA's oversight and certification. Bills recently introduced would require the FAA to review regulations related to pilot interactions with cockpit systems, and to examine assumptions related to how pilots are likely to respond to aircraft failures. Investigations into the Max crashes, including a review conducted by the National Transportation Safety Board, said Boeing designed the 737 Max's flight control system based on inadequate assumptions about how pilots would react to problems. The Senate is also seeking to require the FAA to sign off on industry employees who work under companies' “Organisation Designation Authorisations” (ODAs). Through ODAs, the FAA grants private companies authority to oversee aspects of aircraft certification.",6,48,11.0,0.5881,"pilot, faa, issue, safety, include, report, require, training, ground, order","['lawmaker', 'lobbed', 'harsh', 'point', 'criticism', 'head', 'federal', 'administration', 'june', 'accuse', 'agency', 'stonewall', 'congressional', 'investigation', 'certification', 'faa', 'administrator', 'steve', 'dickson', 'deny', 'agency', 'cooperate', 'pledge', 'work', 'congress', 'improve', 'safety', 'dickson', 'argue', 'improve', 'certification', 'best', 'achieve', 'companyspecific', 'safety', 'plan', 'call', 'safety', 'management', 'system', 'sm', 'say', 'faa', 'issue', 'rule', 'require', 'manufacturer', 'plan', 'already', 'require', 'intend', 'embed', 'safety', 'culture', 'organisation', 'dickson', 'say', 'rule', 'might', 'issue', 'believe', 'big', 'thing', 'implement', 'safety', 'management', 'system', 'manufacturer', 'work', 'right', 'dickson', 'tell', 'senate', 'committee', 'commerce', 'science', 'transportation', 'plan', 'initiate', 'rulemaking', 'hearing', 'lawmaker', 'chastise', 'dickson', 'described', 'faa', 'failure', 'support', 'committee', 'investigation', 'certification', 'committee', 'chair', 'roger', 'wicker', 'say', 'faa', 'fail', 'respond', 'multiple', 'request', 'information', 'faa', 'oversight', 'certification', 'regulator', 'ground', 'march', 'follow', 'crash', 'kill', 'people', 'record', 'delay', 'nonresponsiveness', 'clearly', 'best', 'unwillingness', 'cooperate', 'congressional', 'oversight', 'wicker', 'tell', 'dickson', 'team', 'faa', 'deliberately', 'attempt', 'keep', 'u', 'senator', 'richard', 'blumenthal', 'call', 'faa', 'complicit', 'crash', 'fail', 'morediligent', 'dickson', 'shot', 'back', 'vehemently', 'disagree', 'characterisation', 'desire', 'transparency', 'told', 'lawmaker', 'want', 'collaborate', 'work', 'together', 'committee', 'raise', 'bar', 'believe', 'inaccurate', 'portray', 'agency', 'unresponsive', 'dickson', 'add', 'note', 'faa', 'support', 'several', 'maxrelated', 'investigation', 'dickson', 'review', 'step', 'must', 'complete', 'faa', 'clear', 'fly', 'say', 'expect', 'type', 'ground', 'since', 'march', 'clear', 'third', 'quarter', 'dickson', 'provide', 'timeline', 'faa', 'still', 'must', 'complete', 'test', 'joint', 'operation', 'evaluation', 'board', 'joeb', 'body', 'compose', 'representative', 'faa', 'country', 'regulator', 'pilot', 'must', 'complete', 'pilot', 'assessment', 'standardisation', 'board', 'release', 'public', 'report', 'address', 'joeb', 'find', 'dickson', 'say', 'multiagency', 'technical', 'advisory', 'board', 'must', 'evaluate', 'final', 'design', 'document', 'faa', 'must', 'approve', 'pilot', 'training', 'programme', 'lastly', 'faa', 'issue', 'airworthiness', 'directive', 'lay', 'action', 'must', 'take', 'return', 'sky', 'dickson', 'pilot', 'fly', 'jet', 'signing', 'say', 'june', 'hearing', 'come', 'senate', 'pitch', 'legislation', 'intend', 'improve', 'safety', 'faa', 'oversight', 'certification', 'bill', 'recently', 'introduce', 'require', 'faa', 'review', 'regulation', 'related', 'pilot', 'interaction', 'cockpit', 'system', 'examine', 'assumption', 'related', 'pilot', 'likely', 'respond', 'failure', 'investigation', 'crash', 'include', 'review', 'conduct', 'national', 'transportation', 'safety', 'board', 'say', 'design', 'control', 'system', 'base', 'inadequate', 'assumption', 'pilot', 'react', 'problem', 'senate', 'seek', 'require', 'faa', 'sign', 'industry', 'employee', 'work', 'organisation', 'designation', 'authorisation', 'odas', 'odas', 'faa', 'grant', 'private', 'authority', 'oversee', 'aspect', 'certification']"
"Investigators in Myanmar believe improper maintenance meant an Embraer 190's intermittent nose-gear fault was not rectified before the aircraft landed at Mandalay without its nose-wheels deployed. The Myanmar National Airlines jet (XY-AGQ) suffered substantial damage to its forward fuselage underside, nose-gear doors, avionics access hatch and other systems during the landing on Mandalay's runway 17, as it arrived from Yangon on 12 May last year. None of the 89 occupants was injured. Analysis of flight-data recorder information showed that the weight-off-wheels sensors on the nose-gear and main landing-gear had correctly registered 'true' as the jet lifted off from Yangon. But just after the command to retract the landing-gear, the nose-wheel switch signal changed back to 'false'. This indicates that the nose-gear shock absorber had compressed during the transit, enough to disengage a self-centring cam which normally keeps the nose-wheels from turning in the gear bay. The Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau of Myanmar says the nose-wheel slipped from its centred position and turned about 20°. It remained in this offset for the rest of the flight. The inquiry points out that, if the nose-wheel rotates by more than 8° in the bay, it does not have sufficient clearance to emerge from the bay during landing-gear extension. As a result, the nose-wheel became “physically stuck” when the crew attempted to lower the landing-gear on approach to Mandalay.  Analysis of flight-data recorder information revealed that, on 23 previous flights, the weight-off-wheels switch signal had similarly changed from 'true' to 'false' as the nose-gear retracted. “While all these flights were operated uneventfully, the risk of the nose-gear tyre rotating beyond the limit and getting stuck in the wheel well was present,” the inquiry says. It points out that the aircraft had previously undergone nose-gear servicing in an attempt to rectify a failure message relating to the weight-on-wheels system. The failure message had appeared on 8 May, four days before the accident, as the jet operated the same Yangon-Mandalay route. It returned to Yangon and, after maintenance on the nose-gear sensors, was put back into service. But during another flight, from Yangon to Sittwe on 11 May, the crew felt the nose-gear was “shaking” during the take-off roll and gear retraction, and further maintenance was performed overnight. The accident occurred on the first flight subsequent to the work. Investigators believe maintenance fault isolation work was “not properly done” and that “poor workmanship” had been carried out during nose-gear servicing. “This event highlights the importance for maintenance crew to follow the maintenance and troubleshooting guidance from the aircraft manufacturer,” the inquiry says. “This will allow defects to be rectified as soon as possible, to eliminate potential flight safety consequences.”",6,49,7.0,0.4319,"crew, runway, inquiry, land, approach, accident, investigator, captain, incident, pilot","['investigator', 'myanmar', 'believe', 'improper', 'maintenance', 'meant', 'embraer', 'intermittent', 'nosegear', 'fault', 'rectify', 'land', 'mandalay', 'without', 'nosewheel', 'deployed', 'myanmar', 'national', 'jet', 'xyagq', 'suffer', 'substantial', 'damage', 'forward', 'fuselage', 'underside', 'nosegear', 'door', 'avionics', 'access', 'hatch', 'system', 'land', 'mandalay', 'runway', 'arrive', 'yangon', 'may', 'none', 'occupant', 'injured', 'analysis', 'flightdata', 'recorder', 'information', 'weightoffwheels', 'sensor', 'nosegear', 'main', 'landinggear', 'correctly', 'register', 'jet', 'lift', 'yangon', 'command', 'retract', 'landinggear', 'nosewheel', 'switch', 'signal', 'change', 'back', 'indicates', 'nosegear', 'shock', 'absorber', 'compress', 'transit', 'enough', 'disengage', 'selfcentring', 'cam', 'normally', 'keep', 'nosewheel', 'turn', 'gear', 'bay', 'accident', 'investigation', 'bureau', 'myanmar', 'say', 'nosewheel', 'slip', 'centre', 'position', 'turn', 'remain', 'offset', 'rest', 'inquiry', 'point', 'nosewheel', 'rotates', 'bay', 'sufficient', 'clearance', 'emerge', 'bay', 'landinggear', 'extension', 'result', 'nosewheel', 'become', 'physically', 'stuck', 'crew', 'attempt', 'low', 'landinggear', 'approach', 'mandalay', 'analysis', 'flightdata', 'recorder', 'information', 'reveal', 'previous', 'weightoffwheels', 'switch', 'signal', 'similarly', 'change', 'nosegear', 'retract', 'operate', 'uneventfully', 'risk', 'nosegear', 'tyre', 'rotate', 'beyond', 'limit', 'get', 'stuck', 'wheel', 'well', 'present', 'inquiry', 'say', 'point', 'previously', 'undergone', 'nosegear', 'service', 'attempt', 'rectify', 'failure', 'message', 'relate', 'weightonwheels', 'system', 'failure', 'message', 'appear', 'may', 'day', 'accident', 'jet', 'operate', 'yangonmandalay', 'route', 'return', 'yangon', 'maintenance', 'nosegear', 'sensor', 'put', 'back', 'service', 'another', 'yangon', 'sittwe', 'may', 'crew', 'felt', 'nosegear', 'shake', 'takeoff', 'roll', 'gear', 'retraction', 'far', 'maintenance', 'perform', 'overnight', 'accident', 'occur', 'subsequent', 'work', 'investigator', 'believe', 'maintenance', 'fault', 'isolation', 'work', 'properly', 'poor', 'workmanship', 'carry', 'nosegear', 'service', 'event', 'highlight', 'importance', 'maintenance', 'crew', 'follow', 'maintenance', 'troubleshoot', 'guidance', 'manufacturer', 'inquiry', 'say', 'allow', 'defect', 'rectify', 'soon', 'possible', 'eliminate', 'potential', 'safety', 'consequence']"
"The US Department of Transport (DOT) has backed down from an earlier ban on Chinese carriers, allowing them to fly up to four weekly flights between Mainland China and the USA. The move comes after the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) eased international flight restrictions further on 8 June, allowing more carriers – including those from the USA – to operate flights into the country. A DOT notice on 15 June says it was notified that US carriers have been approved to fly four weekly flights to Mainland China, and will reciprocate by allowing Chinese airlines to fly four weekly flights between the two countries. “We welcome this action by the Chinese government, as an important first step to fully restore air travel,” it states. The DOT adds that it will “continue to press for the full restoration of passenger air travel between the United States and China, in part to allow for the repatriation of Chinese students who have been unable to fly home due to the shortage of flights”. The department first announced the ban – to have kicked in on 16 June – in retaliation for a Chinese order that US officials say effectively prohibits US airlines from resuming China flights. In May, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines applied to the CAAC for authority to resume numerous passenger flights between the countries, after suspending their routes due to the coronavirus outbreak. However, the CAAC denied their requests. China restricted the number of international flights into the country in March, in a bid to stem the number of imported coronavirus cases. Its order in March also also prohibited carriers from adding more capacity than they had in schedules on 12 March – a date on which US airlines had no China flights.",6,50,5.0,0.3191,"carrier, march, international, outbreak, suspend, capacity, schedule, april, united, coronavirus","['u', 'department', 'transport', 'dot', 'back', 'earlier', 'ban', 'chinese', 'carrier', 'allow', 'fly', 'weekly', 'mainland', 'usa', 'move', 'come', 'civil', 'administration', 'caac', 'ease', 'international', 'restriction', 'far', 'june', 'allow', 'carrier', 'include', 'usa', 'operate', 'country', 'dot', 'notice', 'june', 'say', 'notify', 'u', 'carrier', 'approve', 'fly', 'weekly', 'mainland', 'reciprocate', 'allow', 'chinese', 'fly', 'weekly', 'country', 'welcome', 'action', 'chinese', 'government', 'important', 'step', 'fully', 'restore', 'travel', 'state', 'dot', 'add', 'continue', 'press', 'full', 'restoration', 'passenger', 'travel', 'united', 'state', 'part', 'allow', 'repatriation', 'chinese', 'student', 'unable', 'fly', 'home', 'due', 'shortage', 'department', 'announce', 'ban', 'kick', 'june', 'retaliation', 'chinese', 'order', 'u', 'official', 'say', 'effectively', 'prohibits', 'u', 'resume', 'may', 'delta', 'line', 'united', 'apply', 'caac', 'authority', 'resume', 'numerous', 'passenger', 'country', 'suspend', 'route', 'due', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'however', 'caac', 'deny', 'request', 'restrict', 'number', 'international', 'country', 'march', 'bid', 'stem', 'number', 'import', 'coronavirus', 'case', 'order', 'march', 'prohibit', 'carrier', 'add', 'capacity', 'schedule', 'march', 'date', 'u']"
"A continued relaxation of the 'use it or lose it' regulations governing airport take-off and landing slots is essential to aid airlines' restart of operations and ensure connectivity in the longer term, IATA has warned. Regulators suspended the rules earlier this year as the coronavirus crisis was building, allowing airlines to cancel services without losing valuable slots. But with air travel now beginning to return, there is industry concern that airlines could be forced to return to the skies while passenger demand remains weak. “In order to survive airlines will need the support of regulators and governments to enable them to ...respond to where consumer demand is taking place,” says IATA chief economist Brian Pearce. “In particular, they need an extension of the slot-rule waiver.” The problem is compounded by passengers' booking flights much closer to the date of departure than normal, making it difficult for carriers to plan their schedules. They currently have very little idea what demand will look like for the winter season, even though under normal circumstances planning for it would have been well under way. Adding to the concerns, the latest consumer survey from IATA shows that confidence in booking tickets has actually decreased over the past two months. Whereas in early April 61% of people said they would fly within “a few months” of the end of the pandemic, now only 40% do. “It means airlines are still fragile,” says IATA director general Alexandre de Juniac. “The current waiver has been very useful in giving airlines flexibility in the restart.” The danger for governments, IATA suggests, is that if the rule is not extended, those slots normally used for long-haul services will instead be taken over by short-haul providers, as long-haul demand is forecast to take longer to recover. “The loss of slots could mean when demand returns to stronger levels, these long-haul connections could be permanently lost,” says Pearce. “There were good reasons why the 80:20 rule was waived for the summer season,” de Juniac argues. “Regulators should apply the same commonsense approach again and waive the rule for the winter season as well. Airlines need to focus on meeting what consumers want today, without trying to defend the slots needed for what their schedule might look like a year from now.” IATA is also requesting the continuation of several other measures to assist carriers as they restart their operations, such as provision of financial assistance “in ways that do not increase industry debt levels”. This could include subsidising domestic operations and waiving airport and air traffic control charges. Wage-subsidy schemes that have contributed $35 billion in relief to airlines should also be tapered “more slowly”, IATA says, in order to give “airlines more time to recover and minimise job losses”. Governments should also consider funnelling relief through corporate and indirect taxes such as value-added tax or taxes on passengers or fuel, in IATA's view, and avoid any increases in charges and fees that would hit carriers as they struggle to get back on their feet. IATA's concern is that as passengers return to the skies, there will arise a perception that airlines no longer need assistance. But it points out it expects the sector's losses to reach $84.3 billion for the year, while the northern summer season – the period in which most airlines make the bulk of their earnings – will not be operated at a profit, and “the winter season will be even more challenging amid the recovery from Covid-19”. “Financial relief measures are still desperately needed,” says de Juniac. “And policy-relief measures like a slot-usage waiver remain critical. Governments need to grant that by no later than the end of July to provide at least that certainty for this beleaguered and battered industry.”",6,51,9.0,0.3651,"industry, crisis, demand, coronavirus, global, iata, market, level, cargo, expect","['continued', 'relaxation', 'lose', 'regulation', 'govern', 'airport', 'takeoff', 'land', 'slot', 'essential', 'aid', 'restart', 'operation', 'ensure', 'connectivity', 'longer', 'term', 'iata', 'warn', 'regulator', 'suspend', 'rule', 'earlier', 'coronavirus', 'crisis', 'building', 'allow', 'cancel', 'service', 'without', 'lose', 'valuable', 'slot', 'travel', 'begin', 'return', 'industry', 'concern', 'force', 'return', 'sky', 'passenger', 'demand', 'remains', 'weak', 'order', 'survive', 'need', 'support', 'regulator', 'government', 'enable', 'respond', 'consumer', 'demand', 'take', 'place', 'say', 'iata', 'chief', 'economist', 'brian', 'pearce', 'particular', 'need', 'extension', 'slotrule', 'problem', 'compound', 'passenger', 'book', 'much', 'closer', 'date', 'departure', 'normal', 'make', 'difficult', 'carrier', 'plan', 'schedule', 'currently', 'little', 'idea', 'demand', 'look', 'like', 'winter', 'season', 'even', 'though', 'normal', 'circumstance', 'planning', 'well', 'way', 'add', 'concern', 'late', 'consumer', 'survey', 'iata', 'confidence', 'book', 'ticket', 'actually', 'decrease', 'past', 'month', 'whereas', 'early', 'april', 'people', 'say', 'fly', 'within', 'month', 'end', 'pandemic', 'mean', 'still', 'fragile', 'say', 'iata', 'director', 'general', 'alexandre', 'de', 'juniac', 'current', 'waiver', 'useful', 'give', 'flexibility', 'danger', 'government', 'iata', 'suggests', 'rule', 'extend', 'slot', 'normally', 'use', 'longhaul', 'service', 'instead', 'take', 'shorthaul', 'provider', 'longhaul', 'demand', 'forecast', 'take', 'longer', 'recover', 'loss', 'slot', 'mean', 'demand', 'return', 'strong', 'level', 'longhaul', 'connection', 'permanently', 'lose', 'say', 'pearce', 'good', 'reason', 'rule', 'waive', 'summer', 'season', 'de', 'juniac', 'argues', 'regulator', 'apply', 'commonsense', 'approach', 'waive', 'rule', 'winter', 'season', 'well', 'need', 'focus', 'meeting', 'consumer', 'want', 'today', 'without', 'try', 'defend', 'slot', 'need', 'schedule', 'might', 'look', 'like', 'iata', 'request', 'continuation', 'several', 'measure', 'assist', 'carrier', 'restart', 'operation', 'provision', 'financial', 'assistance', 'way', 'increase', 'industry', 'debt', 'level', 'include', 'subsidise', 'domestic', 'operation', 'waive', 'airport', 'traffic', 'control', 'charge', 'wagesubsidy', 'scheme', 'contribute', 'relief', 'taper', 'slowly', 'iata', 'say', 'order', 'give', 'recover', 'minimise', 'job', 'loss', 'government', 'consider', 'funnel', 'relief', 'corporate', 'indirect', 'tax', 'valueadded', 'tax', 'tax', 'passenger', 'fuel', 'iata', 'view', 'avoid', 'increase', 'charge', 'fee', 'hit', 'carrier', 'struggle', 'get', 'back', 'foot', 'iata', 'concern', 'passenger', 'return', 'sky', 'arise', 'perception', 'longer', 'need', 'assistance', 'point', 'expect', 'sector', 'loss', 'reach', 'northern', 'summer', 'season', 'period', 'make', 'bulk', 'earnings', 'operate', 'profit', 'winter', 'season', 'even', 'challenge', 'amid', 'recovery', 'coronavirus', 'financial', 'relief', 'measure', 'still', 'desperately', 'need', 'say', 'de', 'juniac', 'policyrelief', 'measure', 'like', 'slotusage', 'waiver', 'remain', 'critical', 'government', 'need', 'grant', 'later', 'end', 'july', 'provide', 'least', 'certainty', 'beleaguer', 'batter', 'industry']"
"Investigators have disclosed that a KLM Cityhopper crew aborted their take-off roll from Amsterdam after overhearing take-off clearance being granted to another aircraft ahead of them on the same runway. The Dutch Safety Board says the decision averted a potentially serious collision, pointing out that the crew had already acted before a runway incursion alarm alerted the air traffic controller to the situation. It states that the Cityhopper Embraer 190 crew had been cleared for a full-length take-off from Schiphol airport's runway 18C on 27 July 2018. But the inquiry adds that a KLM Boeing 737-800 had been approaching the runway from the W4 intersection, located about 1km beyond the 18C threshold. The 737 crew heard the take-off clearance for the Embraer, and stopped past the hold-short line, telling the controller that they were “on the runway” – whereupon the controller cleared the 737 for take-off. Although the Embraer pilots commenced their take-off roll after seeing the 737 had not encroached on the runway, they aborted after hearing the clearance. The Embraer passed the 737 – positioned on the boundary of the intersection and the runway – at a speed of 85kt and a distance of about 19m (62ft). Shortly afterwards, the inquiry says, the tower control received a runway incursion alert and cancelled the Embraer's departure. But the investigation states that the alert was “not an effective safety barrier” during the event, because it only activated after the Embraer crew had already acted on their own initiative. More effective, it says, was both crews' using the same radio frequency to communicate. The inquiry points out that the use of W4 for intersection departures carried risks, because it serves as a high-speed exit and connects with the runway obliquely, rather than perpendicularly, which limits crews' view of traffic already on the runway and approaching the intersection. Such practices are “discouraged internationally”, it says. One of the aircraft involved, the E190 PH-EXV, pictured on its delivery flight in 2018 Investigators also point out that runway 18C is used less often than other runways for take-off, and has differing designations for exits and departure routes. Use of the runway in combination with others increases complexity for air traffic controllers.

"China's three largest carriers carried more passengers across their networks in May – the first month-on-month increase since the start of the year, when the coronavirus outbreak pummelled travel demand. Domestic passengers made up the lion's share of the number of passengers carried, as the outbreak showed signs of stabilising in Mainland China and domestic travel restrictions eased further.  Total number of passengers carried from January to May The three carriers – Air China, China Southern Airlines and China Eastern Airlines – also reported growth in overall capacity, measured in ASKs, as well as RPKs. For the month, Air China carried 4.07 million passengers across its network, a 53% increase compared to April. This was still about 57% lower year-on-year, however. ASKs grew 45% month on month, but dropped 63% compared to 2019. Meanwhile, RPKs rose nearly 50% month-on-month, led by growth in international traffic. Year on year, Air China saw RPKs shrink about 69%. Passenger load factor for May was 67.5% – 2.1 percentage points higher than April, but 12.7 percentage points lower year-on-year. As for China Southern, it carried 5.87 million passengers for the month – a 52% month-on-month increase, but a 44% decline compared to 2019. Overall ASKs climbed about 38% month on month, but declined about 53% compared to 2019. Overall RPKs grew 46% compared to April, with domestic and regional RPKs showing larger increases. Compared to May 2019, China Southern's RPKs were about 61% lower. Passenger load factor was 66.8%, which was 3.45 percentage points higher than April, but a year-on-year drop of about 14.6 percentage points. Lastly, China Eastern carried about 4.17 million passengers in May, a 56% month-on-month jump. Compared to May 2019, however, this represented a 62% drop in passenger numbers. Overall ASKs climbed nearly 50% month-on-month, led primarily by a growth in domestic capacity. However, it was about 61% lower year-on-year. RPKs, meanwhile, grew by nearly 51% month on month, but shrank about 69% year-on-year. Passenger load factor for the month was 64.6%, a marginal 0.4 percentage point increase compared to April.

"Calgary-based WestJet in July and August will increase frequencies on its network and resume service to certain locations for a total of 39 destinations in Canada, five in the USA and one in Mexico as air travel slowly recovers. WestJet's capacity in June is down 91% year-over-year as people shelter in place to avoid the coronavirus pandemic, according to Cirium's schedules data. The new seasonal schedule will double the number of flights operated on its network compared with June, but July capacity will still be 76% lower year-over-year, the carrier says on 15 June in a statement. Canada's second-largest carrier from 5 July through 4 August will operate flights to Los Angeles from Calgary and Vancouver; to Las Vegas from Calgary, Toronto and Vancouver; and from Toronto to New York LaGuardia International and to Orlando. A weekly flight from Toronto to Cancun, Mexico will begin on 11 July. WestJet tests network demand after grounding aircraft in April WestJet in July will operate more frequent flights within Canada to destinations including Charlottetown, Winnipeg, Kelowna, Yellowknife and Saskatoon. The seasonal schedule will be a test of increasing air travel as businesses start to reopen. Agencies including the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have cautioned against large public gatherings to avoid a resurgence of infections. Mexico, the USA and Canada are debating whether to extend restrictions on nonessential travel between their nations from 21 June through July. All arrivals between Canada and the USA, including citizens, are still required to remain in quarantine for 14 days after travelling from international locations. WestJet competitor Air Canada is also testing demand for air travel that has slowly risen from its low point in April.

"HAPSMobile plans to flight test its high-altitude, pseudo satellite, the HAWK30, at New Mexico's Spaceport of America. The flying-wing unmanned air vehicle (UAV) is solar-powered and designed to stay aloft for six months. By flying in the stratosphere at about 65,000ft altitude, it is able to transmit cellular data over an area of about 3.1 million ha (7.8 million acres). The UAV is being pitched as an alternative to cellular towers or communications satellites. Hawk30 rendering The aircraft made its inaugural flight in September 2019 at NASA Armstrong Flight Research Center in Southern California. HAPSMobile is a startup that is majority-owned by telecommunications firm SoftBank of Japan and is minority-owned by UAV manufacturer AeroVironment of Southern California. AeroVironment builds the HAWK30 in Simi Valley, California. The company has built a number of long-endurance, solar-powered flying wings, including the Helios Prototype for NASA. The New Mexico Economic Development Department is subsidising HAPSMobile's presence at the Spaceport with $500,000. A lease was signed in March 2020, it says. Located in southern New Mexico, Spaceport America is already home to Virgin Galactic, SpinLaunch, AeroVironment and Up Aerospace. It is an FAA-licensed rocket launch complex surrounded by 1.5 million ha of restricted airspace. HAPSMobile says it plans to conduct low-altitude and high-altitude tests at the Spaceport America range. The company had planned by 31 March 2020 to ship Hawk30 to the Hawaiian island of Lanai for further testing in the Pan-Pacific UAS Test Range Complex. The firm says it will still use that test range, though it did not give details of its plan. The company was building two examples of the HAWK30 prototype.

"Commercial aviation association IATA has strengthened calls for Latin American governments to assist their respective airline industries in order to help them survive the coronavirus crisis that has brought the sector to a near-standstill. IATA, which represents 290 airlines worldwide, on 15 June strongly urged governments in Latin America to intervene on behalf of the industry and the 7.2 million jobs that it supports across the region. Air traffic fell by about 96% in Latin America and the Caribbean as the coronavirus pandemic reached its peak in April, and has yet to make any significant steps toward recovery. “This is our last chance to survive this crisis,” says Peter Cerda, IATA regional vice-president for the Americas. “Time is against us and every day that goes by places more agony on an industry that is seeking clarity on timelines to restart operations. No sector has the liquidity to stay afloat during a four- or five-month standstill. We recognise the efforts made by the authorities in fighting this pandemic and we understand what countries are facing, but air transport is essential for our region and cannot be allowed to disappear.” Struggling Latin American airlines include Avianca, which in recent months filed for bankruptcy protection and is now reorganising. Latin American governments have been much less forthcoming in their support for the commercial aviation industry tshan those in other areas, such as North America and Europe. Billion-dollar aid packages in those regions have helped airlines stay afloat, at least temporarily, and reorganise their operations after passenger demand dropped off sharply. Despite recent positive trends and a slow easing of travel restrictions, airlines are still burning through millions of dollars every day. Without the aid, they would likely have had to lay off thousands of employees or shut down completely. This is not the first time IATA has highlighted what it describes as the region's sluggish and uncoordinated reaction to the pandemic, as well as its luke-warm handling of plans to re-start air travel operations. In May, IATA said that governments had provided less than 1% of the airlines' 2019 operating revenue in financial aid, making it the least-supportive region in the world. At the moment, much of South America continues to have stark travel restrictions in place, with most countries planning to reopen in coming weeks. Notable outliers are Colombia and Argentina, which have basically halted passenger air transport operations until 31 August and 1 September, respectively. IATA also says the countries should begin to relax quarantine requirements, congruent with other regions, so that the industry can begin taking steps to recover some of the ground it lost. “Such restrictions severely hamper economic activity by effectively blocking travel, which is essential for the counties of Latin America and the Caribbean that are heavily reliant on tourism,” the organisation writes. This, even though coronavirus infection numbers in Brazil, for example, are surging. The most populous country in South America has reported the second-highest number of cases and deaths after the United States. Two of the continent's major airlines, Colombia's Avianca and Santiago, Chile-based LATAM Airlines last month filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the US as they look to rebalance debt and protect themselves from creditors. Analysts say these two were the first but may not be the last carriers on the continent to seek such protections as the countries also deal with general economic weakness as a result of the pandemic. Supporting airlines is a difficult political proposition for most Latin American nations, even though in the past few years air travel has become more of a public service. Low-cost carriers have begun to bridge vast distances across the continent where ground-based transportation networks, infrastructures and systems are sometimes unreliable. They offer the possibility of connecting far-flung regions much faster by air at a price point that appealed to a larger swath of the population. Avianca's pilots' union ADPA says on 15 June that political squabbling is hindering the reopening of the El Dorado Luis Carlos Galan Sarmiento International airport in Bogota, Colombia's major hub, and it urged authorities to reassess the risks in order to save the industry in that country. ”We observe that many countries affected by this crisis are already starting commercial flights, based on the low risk of transmission of the disease in the passenger cabins of aircraft and the high capacity of traceability on users, especially when a suspicious or positive case is detected,” Leonardo Roldan HernÃ¡ndez, vice president of the pilots' union, says. This kind of tracing is virtually impossible in ground-based transport such as taxis, buses and subways, he adds. The industry supports 600,000 jobs in the travel and tourism sector in Colombia alone, ADPA says, and many of those jobs could be at risk if the crisis drags on longer than three months. ”If the restrictions are extended, job losses and the decrease in the contribution to GDP will have a major impact on the country's economic and social recovery.” Last week IATA joined four other international associations representing airlines, airports, air navigation services providers, travel and tourism suppliers and related sectors in calling on the region's governments to quickly implement the ICAO's global guidelines for restoring air connectivity.

"Mitsubishi Aircraft has reorganised its senior management, as it reiterates it commitment in getting its SpaceJet regional jet programme certificated. The Japanese airframer will be promoting company veteran Yasuhiko Kawaguchi to the role of executive chief engineer. Kawaguchi, who has 35 years of experience in Mitsubishi Aircraft and parent company Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI), will oversee aircraft design and type certification. Mitsubishi Aircraft adds that Kawaguchi also “played a central role” in flight tests in the USA. This fiscal year, Mitsubishi Aircraft will focus on “reorganising, improving the current design at aircraft level, and validating [flight test] data”. It adds that the coronavirus outbreak has forced it to shift its priorities from global development to “perseverance and determination to achieve type certification” on its M90 variant. FlightGlobal reported in late May that Mitsubishi will be closing all non-Japan locations and moving all SpaceJet activities back to its headquarters in Nagoya, in response to cost pressure. It also suspended development of the 76-seat M100 variant, and will halt all flight testing of the M90 variant. “This new, harsh business environment also necessitated the development of a new operating plan for this fiscal year that included resizing its organisation so that Mitsubishi Aircraft may endure and emerge from this crisis. The company's priority will be on obtaining type certification for the SpaceJet M90,” the airframer says. MHI announced in April that it would halving the SpaceJet's budget for the year ending 31 March 2021, as full-year losses on the programme widened.

"Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) is experiencing a boom in cargo flights, even as passenger traffic remains virtually non-existent amid the coronavirus pandemic. The airport notes that May saw 6,335 cargo flight movements, up 29.3% from May 2019. Still, cargo throughput fell 6.8% to 377,000t compared to a year earlier. “Cargo exports experienced an 11% year-on-year increase in May, with North America showing the strongest growth,” says HKIA. “The overall decline in cargo throughput was mainly attributed to the decrease in transhipments and imports due to the reduced belly capacity of passenger flights. Traffic to and from key trading regions in Southeast Asia and India experienced the most significant drops.” May's passenger figures, however, continued to illustrate the crushing impact of coronavirus and its attendant travel restrictions on passenger flights. May 2020 saw 4,735 passenger flight movements, down 84.6% year on year. May's number of passengers handled collapsed, falling 99.4% to just 35,000 passengers, compared with 6.2 million a year earlier. “As regards passenger traffic, due to the continuation of the entry restrictions for non-Hong Kong residents and the suspension of transfer/ transit services in May, visitors and transfer/ transit traffic decreased almost 100%.” Travel by Hong Kong residents was down 99% from May 2019.",6,58,3.0,0.2542,"passenger, loss, operating, revenue, traffic, month, increase, capacity, decline, result","['hong', 'kong', 'international', 'airport', 'hkia', 'experience', 'boom', 'cargo', 'even', 'passenger', 'traffic', 'remains', 'virtually', 'nonexistent', 'amid', 'coronavirus', 'pandemic', 'airport', 'note', 'may', 'saw', 'cargo', 'movement', 'may', 'still', 'cargo', 'throughput', 'fell', 'compare', 'earlier', 'cargo', 'export', 'experienced', 'yearonyear', 'increase', 'may', 'north', 'america', 'strong', 'growth', 'say', 'hkia', 'overall', 'decline', 'cargo', 'throughput', 'mainly', 'attribute', 'decrease', 'transhipments', 'import', 'due', 'reduce', 'belly', 'capacity', 'passenger', 'traffic', 'key', 'trading', 'region', 'southeast', 'asia', 'india', 'experienced', 'significant', 'may', 'passenger', 'figure', 'however', 'continued', 'illustrate', 'crush', 'impact', 'coronavirus', 'attendant', 'travel', 'restriction', 'passenger', 'may', 'saw', 'passenger', 'movement', 'may', 'number', 'passenger', 'handle', 'collapse', 'fall', 'passenger', 'compare', 'earlier', 'regard', 'passenger', 'traffic', 'due', 'continuation', 'entry', 'restriction', 'nonhong', 'kong', 'resident', 'suspension', 'transit', 'service', 'may', 'visitor', 'transit', 'traffic', 'decrease', 'almost', 'travel', 'hong', 'kong', 'resident', 'may']"
"Cross-party parliamentarians in the UK have sharply criticised British Airways' restructuring measures in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, accusing the airline of a “calculated” attempt to use the crisis to weaken employees' terms and cut jobs. The transport select committee's inquiry into the impact of the pandemic on the aviation sector has issued a harsh verdict against the airline, calling its attitude towards personnel a “national disgrace”. “It falls well below the standards we would expect from any employer, especially in light of the scale of taxpayer subsidy, at this time of national crisis,” the committee says. BA is consulting on cuts of up to 12,000 jobs and to downgrade the terms and conditions of approximately 35,000 employees, it states. Parent company IAG's chief executive, Willie Walsh, had stressed several times during testimony to the committee that the company had not made any final decisions on job restructuring, and stated – giving little detail on the numbers involved – that it was conducting its consultations in line with the law. While the committee acknowledges that job losses in the airline sector might be “inevitable”, it has questioned the motivations of those that have already moved to declare redundancies – having heard from unions, including the pilots' association BALPA, that carriers were trying to “take advantage” of the crisis to reduce their workforce unnecessarily. Under-secretary of state for transport Kelly Tolhurst, in a statement to parliament on 3 June, had pointed out that the government's job-retention scheme – under which it funds the wages of furloughed employees – was not intended as a mechanism to enable companies to prepare those personnel for redundancy. But the committee itself acknowledges that this practice is in line with the government's own guidance, even if ministers disapprove. Part of the problem, the committee notes, is that companies are having to make decisions without clarity information on the resumption of air travel. It is urging airlines not to make redundancy decisions “prematurely” and to wait until there is “clearer information” on the recovery period, and avoid “hastily” proceeding with large-scale job cuts at least until the job-retention scheme ends in October.  British Airways has been consulting on up to 12,000 job losses BA's consultation is due to end on 15 June, the committee says. It states that the airline is consulting on meeting minimum statutory obligations on redundancy pay, given the expense of enhanced voluntary redundancy, and to revise various aspects of employment procedures for remaining personnel. The airline is also discussing temporary lay-off for cabin crew and amended rostering for pilots. If the carrier cannot reach agreement on the proposals, it would effectively make all staff redundant and re-employ a proportion of them under new terms – a process which has been described by unions as “fire and rehire”. The committee is pressing BA to extend consultation periods to allow all parties to examine the staffing changes in the context of government plans to assist the air transport sector. But Walsh had already told the committee that the airline needed to act immediately to preserve jobs, and would not put the consultation on hold. Walsh refuted the claim that BA and IAG were exaggerating the scale of the problems it faced, in a letter to the committee. “However, he did not provide any reassurance that BA staff would have their pay, terms and conditions restored, should the company's financial situation improve after the pandemic,” it adds. Over half of BA staff, some 22,000 personnel, have been furloughed under the job-retention scheme and the airline had benefited from £35 million funding under the scheme by mid-May. The airline has also secured £300 million from the government's corporate financing scheme for businesses affected by the coronavirus crisis. BA has not approached the government for a bespoke funding support package, the committee notes.",6,59,8.0,0.3226,"government, uk, carrier, business, state, share, south, airway, financial, plan","['crossparty', 'parliamentarian', 'uk', 'sharply', 'criticise', 'british', 'airway', 'restructuring', 'measure', 'wake', 'coronavirus', 'pandemic', 'accuse', 'calculate', 'attempt', 'use', 'crisis', 'weaken', 'employee', 'term', 'cut', 'job', 'transport', 'select', 'committee', 'inquiry', 'impact', 'pandemic', 'sector', 'issue', 'harsh', 'verdict', 'call', 'attitude', 'towards', 'personnel', 'national', 'disgrace', 'fall', 'well', 'standard', 'expect', 'employer', 'especially', 'light', 'scale', 'taxpayer', 'subsidy', 'national', 'crisis', 'committee', 'say', 'ba', 'consult', 'cut', 'job', 'downgrade', 'term', 'condition', 'approximately', 'employee', 'state', 'parent', 'iag', 'chief', 'executive', 'willie', 'walsh', 'stress', 'several', 'testimony', 'committee', 'make', 'final', 'decision', 'job', 'restructuring', 'state', 'give', 'little', 'detail', 'number', 'involve', 'conduct', 'consultation', 'line', 'law', 'committee', 'acknowledges', 'job', 'loss', 'sector', 'might', 'inevitable', 'question', 'motivation', 'already', 'move', 'declare', 'redundancy', 'heard', 'union', 'include', 'pilot', 'association', 'balpa', 'carrier', 'try', 'take', 'advantage', 'crisis', 'reduce', 'workforce', 'unnecessarily', 'undersecretary', 'state', 'transport', 'kelly', 'tolhurst', 'statement', 'parliament', 'june', 'point', 'government', 'jobretention', 'scheme', 'fund', 'wage', 'furlough', 'employee', 'intend', 'mechanism', 'enable', 'prepare', 'personnel', 'redundancy', 'committee', 'acknowledges', 'practice', 'line', 'government', 'guidance', 'even', 'minister', 'disapprove', 'part', 'problem', 'committee', 'note', 'make', 'decision', 'without', 'clarity', 'information', 'resumption', 'travel', 'urge', 'make', 'redundancy', 'decision', 'prematurely', 'wait', 'clearer', 'information', 'recovery', 'period', 'avoid', 'hastily', 'proceed', 'largescale', 'job', 'cut', 'least', 'jobretention', 'scheme', 'end', 'october', 'british', 'airway', 'consult', 'job', 'loss', 'ba', 'consultation', 'due', 'end', 'june', 'committee', 'say', 'state', 'consult', 'meeting', 'minimum', 'statutory', 'obligation', 'redundancy', 'pay', 'give', 'expense', 'enhance', 'voluntary', 'redundancy', 'revise', 'various', 'aspect', 'employment', 'procedure', 'remain', 'personnel', 'discuss', 'temporary', 'layoff', 'cabin', 'crew', 'amend', 'rostering', 'pilot', 'carrier', 'reach', 'agreement', 'proposal', 'effectively', 'make', 'staff', 'redundant', 'reemploy', 'proportion', 'term', 'process', 'described', 'union', 'fire', 'rehire', 'committee', 'press', 'ba', 'extend', 'consultation', 'period', 'allow', 'party', 'examine', 'staff', 'change', 'context', 'government', 'plan', 'assist', 'transport', 'sector', 'walsh', 'already', 'told', 'committee', 'need', 'act', 'immediately', 'preserve', 'job', 'put', 'consultation', 'hold', 'walsh', 'refute', 'claim', 'ba', 'iag', 'exaggerate', 'scale', 'problem', 'face', 'letter', 'committee', 'however', 'provide', 'reassurance', 'ba', 'staff', 'pay', 'term', 'condition', 'restore', 'financial', 'situation', 'improve', 'pandemic', 'add', 'half', 'ba', 'staff', 'personnel', 'furlough', 'jobretention', 'scheme', 'benefit', 'funding', 'scheme', 'midmay', 'secure', 'government', 'corporate', 'financing', 'scheme', 'business', 'affected', 'coronavirus', 'crisis', 'ba', 'approach', 'government', 'bespoke', 'funding', 'support', 'package', 'committee', 'note']"
"The US government is sending nearly 100 million face coverings to airports and transportation agencies to help ensure travellers protect others from potential coronavirus spread as they use public transit and pass through the facilities. About 86.8 million face coverings will be distributed to airports, and 9.6 million coverings will be distributed to 458 transit agencies and Amtrak, the US Department of Transportation (DOT) said on 12 June. These are in addition to 15 million face coverings that were distributed for critical transportation infrastructure workers already. “This administration is committed to protecting our people and reopening the economy; distributing these facial coverings will help boost public confidence as we begin to resume our normal lives,” says transportation secretary Elaine Chao in a statement. The DOT says passengers are still responsible for bringing their own facial coverings, and these will supplement the travellers' personal equipment. Most airlines have issued a face-covering requirement in their aircraft in order to stop the spread of the highly-infectious virus, but so far there is no general rule forcing carriers to do so. Some airports also require travellers to cover their nose and mouth as they transit through the buildings. The Air Line Pilots Association, International (ALPA) has repeatedly called on Congress to force the Federal Aviation Administration to require airlines to follow US Center for Disease Control (CDC) recommendations in order to keep travellers and airline employees safe. In May, the union released a report accusing airlines of not sufficiently protecting crews from risks related to coronavirus or providing clear health guidance. The report included allegations of airlines scrimping on aircraft sanitation, not following up on suspected coronavirus exposures in crews, missing or inadequate disinfection supplies and protective equipment, and not adhering to guidelines meant to keep crews safe. The pilots complained of unclear, incomplete or confusing communications from their corporate headquarters. Already in April, at the height of the pandemic in the US, the union sent a letter to the FAA complaining of an “absence of...FAA leadership” on this topic, and saying that pilots had reported “a significant number” of failures to meet coronavirus-related guidance published by the CDC. The coronavirus has so far stricken more than 2 million Americans, and caused 114,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University's Coronavirus Resource Centre.

"Air Namibia should be liquidated, the Namibian president has declared following an address to the country, a suggestion which has met objection from unions. President Hage Geingob was answering questions in the parliament building in Windhoek after delivering his state-of-the-nation speech on 4 June. The loss-making airline had not been mentioned in the speech, but Geingob was questioned about its situation afterwards. “Yes, Air Namibia must be liquidated,” he responded. “We have a very serious problem with Air Namibia.” Geingob mentioned that the airline has been “bailed out, bailed out”, but indicated that recommended measures to cut routes – such as the key Frankfurt service – would not be welcomed. “But it must be restructured,” he says. “If liquidation is the thing, we must do that. “It is not making any profits. Just being bailed out, bailed out. No, we must do something about it.” There are no immediate indications that the government has since taken any steps. Air Namibia, like many operators, is dealing with the fallout from the coronavirus crisis which has disrupted its operations. But the Namibia Transport & Allied Workers Union insists a move to close the airline is “not a wise one at the moment”. While it states that it “understands the frustration” expressed by the president, it claims the airline is “not a burden to the state coffers” and contributes “significantly” to the Namibian GDP.

"Operators of Boeing 777s are being cautioned that autothrottles could trigger an uncommanded advancement of the throttle levers on the ground, after a number of instances. Most of the occurrences have taken place during taxiing. But in one event, says the US FAA, the uncommanded autothrottle advance happened after landing, before the aircraft's speedbrakes were retracted. Analysis of the events have traced the issue to a short-circuit between grounding wires for the take-off/go-around switches which command take-off thrust during a missed approach. Such a short-circuit causes the aircraft to detect, erroneously, that the switches have been pushed. This in turn results in the autothrottle adapting to the thrust reference mode, and setting the thrust levers to generate the required take-off power level. While the FAA does not consider that the situation justifies an airworthiness directive, it has issued a special bulletin to 777 operators to highlight the issue. It points out that a previous Boeing service bulletin, from December 2015, provides operators with directions for changing ground wiring in the take-off/go-around switch. Boeing also distributed a bulletin last year to pilots advising that they monitor the thrust levers and, if necessary, prevent their uncommanded advancement by the autothrottle. The FAA is recommending that 777 operators introduce the actions “at the earliest opportunity”.",6,62,7.0,0.2423,"crew, runway, inquiry, land, approach, accident, investigator, captain, incident, pilot","['operator', 'caution', 'autothrottles', 'trigger', 'uncommanded', 'advancement', 'throttle', 'lever', 'ground', 'number', 'instance', 'occurrence', 'take', 'place', 'taxi', 'event', 'say', 'u', 'faa', 'uncommanded', 'autothrottle', 'advance', 'happen', 'land', 'speedbrakes', 'retract', 'analysis', 'event', 'trace', 'issue', 'shortcircuit', 'ground', 'wire', 'switch', 'command', 'takeoff', 'thrust', 'miss', 'approach', 'shortcircuit', 'cause', 'detect', 'erroneously', 'switch', 'push', 'turn', 'result', 'autothrottle', 'adapt', 'thrust', 'reference', 'mode', 'set', 'thrust', 'lever', 'generate', 'require', 'takeoff', 'power', 'level', 'faa', 'consider', 'situation', 'justifies', 'airworthiness', 'directive', 'issue', 'special', 'bulletin', 'operator', 'highlight', 'issue', 'point', 'previous', 'service', 'bulletin', 'december', 'provide', 'operator', 'direction', 'change', 'ground', 'wiring', 'switch', 'distribute', 'bulletin', 'pilot', 'advise', 'monitor', 'thrust', 'lever', 'necessary', 'prevent', 'uncommanded', 'advancement', 'autothrottle', 'faa', 'recommend', 'operator', 'introduce', 'action', 'early', 'opportunity']"
"Ten Russian airports, including Moscow Sheremetyevo, have applied to the civil aviation regulator for subsidies to compensate for the loss of passenger traffic in the second quarter. Federal air transport regulator Rosaviatsia began examining applications for partial reimbursement on 4 June, the day after the government published a subsidy decree. The government has allocated a total of Rb10.9 billion ($156 million) for the airport subsidy programme. “This measure of state support will ensure the continued uninterrupted operation of airports and the preservation of aviation personnel,” says Rosaviatsia. Sheremetyevo recorded just 161,000 passengers in April compared with over 3.3 million in January. Along with Sheremetyevo the airports of Kazan, Murmansk, Ufa, Simferopol, Belgorod, Anapa, Krasnodar, Sochi and Nizhnekamsk are seeking subsidies to cover the decline of traffic resulting from the coronavirus crisis. Rosaviatsia says it expects the subsidies to be approved within a few days once document verification is complete. It has not detailed the level of subsidy sought by each airport operator.

"Cathay Pacific will slowly reinstate capacity in June and July, even as it expects capacity in the subsequent months to continue to be “substantially reduced”. This also marks the first time since the coronavirus outbreak emerged that the carrier will be adding capacity to its already-pared down network. For June, Cathay and sister carrier Cathay Dragon will operate 3.5% capacity, marginally higher than the 3% capacity operated in May. This will increase again in July, when both carriers will operate at approximately 9.4% capacity. Cathay group customer and commercial chief Ronald Lam stressed that the plans to reinstate capacity “remain contingent on the further relaxation of travel restrictions around the world and are subject to change”. Adds Lam: “We will continue to monitor demand and adapt our passenger schedule accordingly, though we expect we will be operating a substantially reduced schedule over the coming months.” Lam's comments come as Cathay released its traffic figures for May, which again saw significant year-on-year decreases in passenger traffic. For the month, Cathay and Cathay Dragon carried nearly 18.500 passengers, a 99.4% year-on-year drop. However, this was still higher than April's figure of around 13,700 passengers. Compared to the same month last year, overall RPKs fell 99.1%, while ASKs were slashed 97.5%. Passenger load factor dipped 53.3 percentage points to 29.6%. Lam notes that demand continued to be weak, and that both airlines carried just 1% of the number of passengers they carried in the same month last year, with an average of 600 passengers a day. Cathay and Cathay Dragon still maintained their “skeleton passenger schedule” covering 14 points in their network, he adds. Cathay reiterated that it anticipates a “substantial loss” for the first half of the year. On 9 June, the carrier announced a HK$39 billion ($5.03 billion) recapitalisation plan, which includes a significant bailout from the Hong Kong government. Cathay, which has been hard hit by the pandemic, disclosed it had been bleeding HK$2.5 to HK$3 billion in cash a month. Passenger revenue has also been reduced to just 1% of what it used to earn in past years. In the longer term, Cathay says that its business model “will be re-evaluated”. By the end of this year, Cathay's management will make recommendations to its board on the “optimum size and shape” of the group.",6,64,3.0,0.3322,"passenger, loss, operating, revenue, traffic, month, increase, capacity, decline, result","['cathay', 'pacific', 'slowly', 'reinstate', 'capacity', 'june', 'july', 'even', 'expect', 'capacity', 'subsequent', 'month', 'continue', 'substantially', 'reduce', 'mark', 'since', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'emerge', 'carrier', 'add', 'capacity', 'alreadypared', 'network', 'june', 'cathay', 'sister', 'carrier', 'cathay', 'dragon', 'operate', 'capacity', 'marginally', 'high', 'capacity', 'operate', 'may', 'increase', 'july', 'carrier', 'operate', 'approximately', 'capacity', 'cathay', 'customer', 'commercial', 'chief', 'ronald', 'lam', 'stress', 'plan', 'reinstate', 'capacity', 'remain', 'contingent', 'far', 'relaxation', 'travel', 'restriction', 'around', 'world', 'subject', 'change', 'add', 'lam', 'continue', 'monitor', 'demand', 'adapt', 'passenger', 'schedule', 'accordingly', 'though', 'expect', 'operating', 'substantially', 'reduce', 'schedule', 'come', 'lam', 'comment', 'come', 'cathay', 'release', 'traffic', 'figure', 'may', 'saw', 'significant', 'yearonyear', 'decrease', 'passenger', 'traffic', 'month', 'cathay', 'cathay', 'dragon', 'carry', 'nearly', 'passenger', 'yearonyear', 'drop', 'however', 'still', 'high', 'april', 'figure', 'around', 'passenger', 'compare', 'month', 'overall', 'rpks', 'fell', 'asks', 'slash', 'passenger', 'load', 'factor', 'dipped', 'percentage', 'point', 'lam', 'note', 'demand', 'continued', 'weak', 'carry', 'number', 'passenger', 'carry', 'month', 'average', 'passenger', 'day', 'cathay', 'cathay', 'dragon', 'still', 'maintain', 'skeleton', 'passenger', 'schedule', 'cover', 'point', 'network', 'add', 'cathay', 'reiterate', 'anticipates', 'substantial', 'loss', 'half', 'june', 'carrier', 'announce', 'hk', 'recapitalisation', 'plan', 'include', 'significant', 'bailout', 'hong', 'kong', 'government', 'cathay', 'hard', 'hit', 'pandemic', 'disclose', 'bleeding', 'hk', 'hk', 'cash', 'month', 'passenger', 'revenue', 'reduce', 'use', 'earn', 'past', 'longer', 'term', 'cathay', 'say', 'business', 'model', 'reevaluate', 'end', 'cathay', 'management', 'make', 'recommendation', 'board', 'optimum', 'size', 'shape']"
"The risk of uncontained engine failures has led the Federal Aviation Administration to propose requiring airlines to inspect disks inside the high-pressure turbines of some GE Aviation GEnx powerplants. A proposed airworthiness directive (AD) made public by the US government on 11 June targets GEnx-1B turbofans, which power Boeing 787s, and GEnx-2Bs, which power 747-8s.  GEnx-1B turbofans power Boeing 787s “This proposed AD was prompted by a report of the potential for undetected subsurface anomalies formed during the manufacturing process that could result in uncontained failure of the [high-pressure turbine] rotor stage two disk,” says the FAA's proposal. During an investigation completed by GE, “a subsurface anomaly was found in early production” disks, says the order, which would affect 276 powerplants in the fleets of US carriers. Globally, 1,250 engines are impacted, says GE. In January, the company addressed the issue in a service bulletin calling on airlines to complete “immersion ultrasonic” inspections” of affected engines. Operators have alredy inspected about 8% of the GEnx-1B fleet and 4% of the GEnx-2B fleet, GE says. The FAA's order would require airlines to complete those inspections during the next shop visit or before the disks log 6,500 cycles. If those inspections uncover disks with anomalies, carriers would need to replace the disks before further flight.

"Switzerland's parliament has voted in favour of introducing an environmental levy on airline tickets. The Swiss federal assembly says 135 of 195 members approved the proposal, which last year received support from a “large majority” in the nation's lower chamber, the council of states, following “worldwide climate protests”. A similar proposal had been rejected by the federal assembly in late 2018. Under the new plan, passengers are to be charged between Swfr30 ($31) and Swfr120 per ticket “depending on distance and [travel] class”. The federal assembly says “nearly half” of the proceeds will flow into a climate fund for emissions-reduction initiatives, but has yet to determine how this will be used as details of the plan are “controversial”. Swiss regional carrier Helvetic Airways says it is “basically not opposed” to an environmental tax in principle, but argues that it should be applied at European or global level. “This is a clear distortion of competition since the foreign airlines with only few departures from Switzerland will not pass on the tax,” argues the Zurich-based airline. Citing the coronavirus crisis and airlines' liquidity problems, it complains that the new tax comes “at the worst possible time”. However, the airline doubts that the new tax will deter customers from booking tickets: “A tax on flight tickets between Swfr30 and Swfr120 is far too low to discourage the Swiss population from flying, even over short distances.” Lufthansa subsidiary Swiss meanwhile voices concern it will be “penalised twice”, as a long-haul operator with a hub in Zurich, if the levy is based on flight length and travel class. “Direct long-haul flights will be disadvantaged because it will then become more interesting for a passenger to fly a short distance [abroad] and pay a correspondingly lower levy to a foreign hub,” Swiss suggests. Noting that the measure applies to airlines rather than passengers, Swiss – like Helvetic – foresees that international carriers with limited flights from Switzerland will absorb the levy to attract passengers to their hubs abroad. “Since the main production of Swiss airlines takes place in Switzerland, Swiss airlines are disproportionately affected,” says the Lufthansa unit. “Only if the passengers are directly liable to pay the levy, and not the airlines, can market distortions be mitigated.” Swiss also asserts that “in global air transport, only global measures will benefit the climate and at the same time...not distort competition”.

"Bombardier is cutting 600 jobs at its aerostructures business in Belfast, Northern Ireland, as it seeks to mitigate the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. The cuts include 400 ”core” employees and ”nearly all” of the 200 contract staff from a total workforce of 3,500. The Belfast operation makes parts for several aircraft including wings for the Airbus A220 narrowbody, alongside Bombardier's own Learjet, Challenger and Global business jet families. On 5 June, parent company Bombardier Aviation announced it was cutting 2,500 personnel - mainly at its Canadian manufacturing operations in Montreal and Toronto - in response to a predicted 30% slide in business jet deliveries in 2020. “Bombardier Aviation announced last week that it would adjust its workforce to align with current market conditions reflecting the extraordinary industry interruptions and challenges caused by Covid-19,” says the Canadian firm. “We have now reviewed our requirements in Belfast for all of our aircraft programmes and regret to confirm that we must adjust our core workforce levels downwards by around 400 to align with market demand for the remainder of this year and through 2021.” Bombardier says it will ”explore opportunities to mitigate the number of redundancies”. However, up to 200 casual staff will be laid off over the coming months. The job cuts ”will impact all areas of the company,” it adds, “but we cannot provide specific breakdowns of particular functions and sites affected”. In October, Spirit AeroSystems announced it was to acquire Bombardier's aerostructures business, including the Belfast operation, for a total consideration of around $1 billion.

"Lufthansa Grouphas outlined plans to cut the equivalent of 22,000 full-time jobs, half of which will be in Germany, and operate 100 fewer aircraft as it recovers from the effects of the Covid-19 crisis. The airlines met with representatives of three of its trade unions on 10 June and has set a goal of reaching agreement on the proposed job cuts by 22 June. The airline says its aim is to “avoid dismissals as far as possible by means of short-time work and crisis agreements”. “Without a significant reduction in personnel costs during the crisis, we will miss the opportunity of a better restart and riskLufthansa Group[emerging] considerably weakened after it,” statesLufthansalabour director Michael Niggemann. He adds that “personnel overhang is likely to become even larger”, in which case “implementing unilateral measures” would become inevitable. “We want to avoid this scenario. That is why we are doing everything we can to achieve concrete results with our collective bargaining partners by 22 June,” says Niggemann.

"US investigators have determined that an American Airlines Airbus A321 landed short of the runway and suffered a tail-strike after encountering a microburst on approach to Charlotte-Douglas airport. But the National Transportation Safety Board points out that the crew had not adopted the airline's guidance on approach speed and aircraft configuration when faced with windshear risk. The A321 (N564UW) had been conducting an ILS approach to runway 36L after arriving from Atlanta on 15 August 2015. Investigators state that the crew acknowledged a low-level windshear advisory for the approach and the pilots had discussed rain showers visible over the airport. As the aircraft descended through 2,500ft the captain – who was flying – disengaged the autopilot and, some 30s later, asked for the flaps to be set in the full configuration. The inquiry says the crew was advised of a windshear alert with a 20kt loss of airspeed at 1nm final, and that other aircraft had reported 8-15kt airspeed gains at 300ft. But it states that the captain “did not reference” the quick-reference handbook which, under these windshear conditions, identifies precautions including selection of the longest suitable runway, increasing the approach speed by 15kt above reference, and using a 'flap 3' configuration, one stage below full. The crew did not increase the approach speed, maintaining 140-145kt in the minute before the accident. About 7s before the touchdown, the airspeed started to fall and it dropped below groundspeed while groundspeed began to rise. Wind information showed a 10kt headwind that increased to 15kt, before switching by 180° to a 15kt tailwind just as the airspeed began to fall. This tailwind persisted for about 7s before turning back to a headwind. As a result, the aircraft lost lift. The first officer told the inquiry that the aircraft “fell like a brick”. Just before the touchdown, the crew received an aural windshear warning and the captain immediately called for a go-around, but the aircraft struck the ground about 3s after the alarm. It landed short of the runway, although in the paved displaced threshold area, with a 2.6g impact, hitting several runway lights and suffering a tail-strike which damaged a 20ft section of the aft fuselage. The aircraft became airborne during the go-around and was subsequently vectored for a landing on runway 36C. None of the 159 occupants was injured. NTSB investigators, who released their findings on 8 June, state that the decision by the captain to continue the approach without applying the configuration and airspeed precautions in the quick-reference handbook contributed to the accident. The first officer told the inquiry that the crew did not refer to the handbook “because there were no thunderstorms or convective activity in the area”.",6,69,7.0,0.6221,"crew, runway, inquiry, land, approach, accident, investigator, captain, incident, pilot","['u', 'investigator', 'determine', 'american', 'land', 'short', 'runway', 'suffer', 'tailstrike', 'encounter', 'microburst', 'approach', 'charlottedouglas', 'airport', 'national', 'transportation', 'safety', 'board', 'point', 'crew', 'adopt', 'guidance', 'approach', 'speed', 'configuration', 'face', 'windshear', 'risk', 'conduct', 'il', 'approach', 'runway', 'arrive', 'atlanta', 'august', 'investigator', 'state', 'crew', 'acknowledge', 'lowlevel', 'windshear', 'advisory', 'approach', 'pilot', 'discuss', 'rain', 'shower', 'visible', 'airport', 'descend', 'captain', 'fly', 'disengage', 'autopilot', 'later', 'ask', 'flap', 'set', 'full', 'configuration', 'inquiry', 'say', 'crew', 'advise', 'windshear', 'alert', 'loss', 'airspeed', 'final', 'report', 'airspeed', 'gain', 'state', 'captain', 'reference', 'quickreference', 'handbook', 'windshear', 'condition', 'identifies', 'precaution', 'include', 'selection', 'long', 'suitable', 'runway', 'increase', 'approach', 'speed', 'reference', 'use', 'configuration', 'stage', 'full', 'crew', 'increase', 'approach', 'speed', 'maintain', 'minute', 'accident', 'touchdown', 'airspeed', 'start', 'fall', 'drop', 'groundspeed', 'groundspeed', 'begin', 'rise', 'wind', 'information', 'headwind', 'increase', 'switch', 'tailwind', 'airspeed', 'begin', 'fall', 'tailwind', 'persist', 'turn', 'back', 'headwind', 'result', 'lose', 'lift', 'officer', 'told', 'inquiry', 'fell', 'like', 'brick', 'touchdown', 'crew', 'receive', 'aural', 'windshear', 'warn', 'captain', 'immediately', 'call', 'goaround', 'struck', 'ground', 'alarm', 'land', 'short', 'runway', 'although', 'pave', 'displace', 'threshold', 'area', 'impact', 'hit', 'several', 'runway', 'light', 'suffer', 'tailstrike', 'damage', 'section', 'aft', 'fuselage', 'become', 'airborne', 'goaround', 'subsequently', 'vectored', 'land', 'runway', 'none', 'occupant', 'injured', 'ntsb', 'investigator', 'release', 'finding', 'june', 'state', 'decision', 'captain', 'continue', 'approach', 'without', 'apply', 'configuration', 'airspeed', 'precaution', 'quickreference', 'handbook', 'contribute', 'accident', 'officer', 'told', 'inquiry', 'crew', 'refer', 'handbook', 'thunderstorm', 'convective', 'activity', 'area']"
"London Heathrow airport's operator is cutting jobs as it warns that the UK government's newly-introduced quarantine policy for arriving passengers is contributing to a situation in which employment levels cannot be maintained. The controversial quarantine regulation, requiring 14-day isolation for arriving passengers, has been heavily criticised by airlines. Heathrow's operator states that job levels are “no longer sustainable”, adding that it has cut a third of managerial positions as part of a restructuring. “We have now agreed a voluntary severance scheme with our union partners,” says chief executive John Holland-Kaye. “While we cannot rule out further job reductions, we will continue to explore options to minimise the number of job losses.” Heathrow remained desolate in May, with passenger numbers at the airport sinking to just 228,000 for the month, compared with 6.8 million in May last year. Fewer than 6,500 flights operated against the previous figure of over 41,500. Although there was a rise in cargo-only traffic, overall cargo tonnage is down 40%.

"A lack of pre-flight planning and runway confusion nearly caused an Airbus A320 operated by Indian low-cost carrier IndiGo to land on an unfinished runway at Male, Maldives. India's Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) classifies the 3 February 2019 incident as a “marginally avoided” controlled flight into terrain. At 15:06 local time, after operating a service from Mumbai, the aircraft (VT-INY, MSN3863) came to within 12ft radio height of touching down on the unfinished runway parallel to the assigned runway 36. “The operating crew was aware of the existence of an under-construction runway parallel to the existing active runway,” states the DGCA report into the incident. “However, there was confusion regarding the actual runway in use during approach and crew made an approach to the under construction runway. At about 12ft radio height, the pilot in-command (PIC) not being convinced that the runway to which they are approaching is the active runway carried out a missed approach.” The aircraft subsequently made a go around and landed safely. None of the 100 passengers or six crew was injured. The DGCA's investigation revealed that the crew had expected to land on runway 18, and were informed that the unfinished runway was parallel to runway 18 on the left. Upon reaching the vicinity of Male the crew was informed by air traffic control (ATC) that Runway 36, and not 18, was the operational runway. The crew was also informed that ILS was not functioning, and were advised to make an RNAV approach for Runway 36. Instead, the crew asked for and performed a VOR36 approach. At 400ft radio altitude the PIC, flying the aircraft, expressed reservations about the runway the aircraft was approaching, noting the large 'X' cross marks, but the first officer insisted this was the correct runway. “The crew also did not sight the precision approach path indicator visual aid during the first approach,” says DGCA. “The aircraft descended to 12ft radio altitude above the runway under-construction, by this time the PIC was still unable to confirm the active runway performed a go-around.” Subsequently, air traffic control confirmed that they had nearly come down on the wrong runway. The DGCA noted that neither crew had flown to Male and that planning for the flight was inadequate. Moreover, it believed the PIC showed a lack of assertiveness, and that the flight was dispatched with insufficient information. In addition to training for the crew involved, the DGCA recommended that IndiGo avoid using relative directions such as left/right, instead replacing them with cardinal directions – north, south, east, and west. The DGCA notes that the Maldives was asked to aid in the investigation, but did not respond to queries.",6,71,7.0,0.5665,"crew, runway, inquiry, land, approach, accident, investigator, captain, incident, pilot","['lack', 'preflight', 'planning', 'runway', 'confusion', 'nearly', 'cause', 'operate', 'indian', 'lowcost', 'carrier', 'indigo', 'land', 'unfinished', 'runway', 'male', 'maldives', 'india', 'director', 'general', 'civil', 'dgca', 'classifies', 'february', 'incident', 'marginally', 'avoid', 'control', 'terrain', 'local', 'operating', 'service', 'mumbai', 'vtiny', 'come', 'within', 'radio', 'height', 'touch', 'unfinished', 'runway', 'parallel', 'assign', 'runway', 'operating', 'crew', 'aware', 'existence', 'underconstruction', 'runway', 'parallel', 'exist', 'active', 'runway', 'state', 'dgca', 'report', 'incident', 'however', 'confusion', 'regard', 'actual', 'runway', 'use', 'approach', 'crew', 'make', 'approach', 'construction', 'runway', 'radio', 'height', 'pilot', 'incommand', 'pic', 'convince', 'runway', 'approach', 'active', 'runway', 'carry', 'miss', 'subsequently', 'make', 'go', 'around', 'land', 'safely', 'none', 'passenger', 'crew', 'injured', 'dgca', 'investigation', 'reveal', 'crew', 'expect', 'land', 'runway', 'inform', 'unfinished', 'runway', 'parallel', 'runway', 'left', 'upon', 'reach', 'vicinity', 'male', 'crew', 'inform', 'traffic', 'control', 'atc', 'runway', 'operational', 'runway', 'crew', 'inform', 'il', 'function', 'advise', 'make', 'rnav', 'approach', 'runway', 'instead', 'crew', 'ask', 'perform', 'approach', 'radio', 'altitude', 'pic', 'fly', 'express', 'reservation', 'runway', 'approach', 'note', 'large', 'x', 'cross', 'mark', 'officer', 'insist', 'correct', 'runway', 'crew', 'sight', 'precision', 'approach', 'path', 'indicator', 'visual', 'aid', 'approach', 'say', 'dgca', 'descend', 'radio', 'altitude', 'runway', 'underconstruction', 'pic', 'still', 'unable', 'confirm', 'active', 'runway', 'perform', 'subsequently', 'traffic', 'control', 'confirm', 'nearly', 'come', 'wrong', 'runway', 'dgca', 'note', 'neither', 'crew', 'flown', 'male', 'planning', 'inadequate', 'moreover', 'believe', 'pic', 'lack', 'assertiveness', 'dispatch', 'insufficient', 'information', 'addition', 'training', 'crew', 'involve', 'dgca', 'recommend', 'indigo', 'avoid', 'use', 'relative', 'direction', 'instead', 'replace', 'cardinal', 'direction', 'north', 'south', 'east', 'west', 'dgca', 'note', 'maldives', 'ask', 'aid', 'investigation', 'respond', 'query']"
"Maintenance failures led to a fuel spill that caused a Boeing 767-200ER operated by Dynamic International Airways to catch fire on the ground at Fort Lauderdale in 2015. The incident was made more severe because passengers began evacuating the jet before the pilots shut down the aircraft's right engine, according to the National Transportation Safety Board's (NTSB) accident report, released on 10 June. One passenger was seriously injured when blown over by exhaust from that engine, and another 21 people received minor injuries, the NTSB says. The incident involved a 767 powered by Pratt & Whitney JT9D-7R4E4 turbofans. The aircraft, registration N251MY, was operating Dynamic flight 405 to Caracas. Investigators traced the fuel leak to a fuel-line coupling that had loosened due to lack of a “safety lockwire” on the coupling. “The leak occurred after the coupling loosened due to the missing safety wire, which was the result of an error by the third-party maintenance provider”, says the report. The leaked fuel ignited after contacting the hot engine case. The charred left-side engine of a Dynamic International Airways Boeing 767 that caught fire at Fort Lauderdale in 2015. Dynamic has since changed its name to Eastern Airlines. That company did not respond immediately to a request for comment. Maintenance had been performed on the coupling in October 2012, prior to the aircraft being placed in storage, the NTSB says. Additionally, the area of the coupling should have been subject to a visual inspection when the jet came out of storage in 2015, the NTSB says. Kalitta Air performed the maintenance before and after the aircraft was stored, it adds. That company's representative also did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The 767 had accumulated about 240h of flight between leaving storage and the incident. The Dynamic 767 pushed back from the gate at 12:28 local time. Shortly after, pilots in other aircraft on the ground at Fort Lauderdale notified controllers that the Dynamic 767's left-side engine was leaking fuel. Soon realising their aircraft was on fire, flight 405's pilots shut down the left-side JT9D using the fire handle. At that time, without coordinating with the pilots, a flight attendant called for passengers to evacuate. After the evacuation began a pilot told passengers to exit on the right side. However, the right-side engine was still running, which led to the single serious injury. The fire damaged the engine strut and nacelle, and the jet's left wing, left main landing gear and the left side of its fuselage, the NTSB says.

"Boeing has pledged to take additional steps to promote diversity and equality and to address racial discrimination following nationwide protests calling for reforms to address inequality. The airframer's chief executive David Calhoun laid out broad strokes of Boeing's effort in a 10 June letter to staff, making Boeing the latest large US company to pledge support for the movement. Calhoun's letter follows the 25 May death of George Floyd, an African American who died under a Minneapolis police officer's knee. Floyd's death sparked nationwide demonstrations, tense standoffs between police and protestors, and instances of looting. “What's happening across the US now goes beyond discrimination and harassment, beyond diversity and inclusion. What we're seeing is the ongoing human cost of historic and persistent racial inequality in the United States,” says Calhoun's letter to staff. “As a company and as human beings, we need to work even harder at doing something about it.” Calhoun had addressed intolerance in another letter, sent to staff 1 June, that stressed Boeing's dedication to inclusion, pledged support for unfairly-treated staff and encouraged broader discussion. The broader effort that Calhoun outlined today came after staff asked him to do more, he says. Boeing is providing leaders with materials to guide conversations about inclusion and diversity and related concerns, and Calhoun is encouraging leaders to have such conversations with their staff. Boeing will “redouble our determination to drive out behaviors that violate our values and injure colleagues”, Calhoun adds, noting Boeing severed ties with an employee who ten days ago “made an abusive and harassing racial remark to a colleague”. The Chicago-based airframer will also, over four years, double to $50 million its financial support for “partnerships that create a range of opportunities for marginalised communities”. Calhoun adds that Boeing is “capturing this moment to help solve a problem that has for so long prevented our society from being as inclusive and just as it should be”.",6,73,2.0,0.304,"executive, chief, cut, add, situation, staff, crisis, make, coronavirus, employee","['pledge', 'take', 'additional', 'step', 'promote', 'diversity', 'equality', 'address', 'racial', 'discrimination', 'follow', 'nationwide', 'protest', 'call', 'reform', 'address', 'inequality', 'airframer', 'chief', 'executive', 'david', 'calhoun', 'laid', 'broad', 'stroke', 'effort', 'june', 'letter', 'staff', 'make', 'late', 'large', 'u', 'pledge', 'support', 'movement', 'calhoun', 'letter', 'follow', 'may', 'death', 'george', 'floyd', 'african', 'american', 'die', 'minneapolis', 'police', 'officer', 'knee', 'floyd', 'death', 'spark', 'nationwide', 'demonstration', 'tense', 'standoff', 'police', 'protestors', 'instance', 'loot', 'happen', 'across', 'u', 'go', 'beyond', 'discrimination', 'harassment', 'beyond', 'diversity', 'inclusion', 'see', 'ongoing', 'human', 'cost', 'historic', 'persistent', 'racial', 'inequality', 'united', 'state', 'say', 'calhoun', 'letter', 'staff', 'human', 'need', 'work', 'even', 'harder', 'something', 'calhoun', 'address', 'intolerance', 'another', 'letter', 'sent', 'staff', 'june', 'stress', 'dedication', 'inclusion', 'pledge', 'support', 'unfairlytreated', 'staff', 'encourage', 'broader', 'discussion', 'broader', 'effort', 'calhoun', 'outline', 'today', 'come', 'staff', 'ask', 'say', 'provide', 'leader', 'material', 'guide', 'conversation', 'inclusion', 'diversity', 'related', 'concern', 'calhoun', 'encourage', 'leader', 'conversation', 'staff', 'redouble', 'determination', 'drive', 'behavior', 'violate', 'value', 'injure', 'colleague', 'calhoun', 'add', 'note', 'sever', 'tie', 'employee', 'day', 'ago', 'make', 'abusive', 'harass', 'racial', 'remark', 'colleague', 'chicagobased', 'airframer', 'double', 'financial', 'support', 'partnership', 'create', 'range', 'opportunity', 'marginalise', 'community', 'calhoun', 'add', 'capture', 'moment', 'help', 'solve', 'problem', 'long', 'prevent', 'society', 'inclusive']"
"South Africa's shadow public enterprises minister is insisting that the government ease air transport pressures by allowing other operators to conduct repatriation services. Ghaleb Cachalia, from the opposition Democratic Alliance party, argues that South African Airways – which has been mired in a drawn-out business rescue process – does not have sufficient cash to carry out the task properly. The party says the government, particularly its international relations department, should “facilitate” flights to and from South Africa. It has sought clarification from the government as to whether SAA is being given preferential treatment at the expense of other carriers. “SAA has no cash in its coffers,” says Cachalia, describing the airline as a government “vanity project”. “In the absence of shouldering its responsibility to South African citizens, the very least that can be done is for [the international relations department] to facilitate other international carriers that are willing to step into the breach.” SAA's repatriation efforts had been threatened by its financial predicament, with the carrier's business rescue practitioners having previously declared that it did not have sufficient funding to maintain such flights beyond early May. Although the government started easing the lockdown on 1 June, South Africa's air transport system remains in poor shape, with three major carriers under various levels of financial pressure. Transport minister Fikile Mbalula, during an inspection visit to Johannesburg airport on 3 June, stated that the government's gradual release of lockdown measures would mean a phased introduction of domestic services at the country's airports. Johnannesburg, Cape Town, Durban and Lanseria would be covered in the first phase. This will extend subsequently to Bloemfontein, Kruger and Polokwane airports, before a third phase brought in Kimberley, East London, Port Elizabeth, Upington and Umtata.

"Start-up European operator HiSky Moldova has agreed to acquire its first aircraft, an Airbus A320, under a deal with US lessor Air Lease. HiSky Moldova will receive the used aircraft in July, according to the lessor. It intends to operate from its Chisinau base initially to six destinations, including London, Paris, Dublin, Lisbon, Bologna and Dusseldorf. HiSky has identified the aircraft as MSN4493, a 2010 airframe powered by International Aero Engines V2500s, originally delivered to Scoot but most recently used by Italian carrier Ernest Airlines which ceased operations in January this year. “We are thrilled to work with one of the largest aircraft leasing companies in the world to assist with the launch of our airline,” says HiSky chief executive Iulian Scorpan. Scorpan is the former head of flag-carrier Air Moldova. HiSky's early development has not been smooth. It emerged shortly before the coronavirus crisis threw European air transport into chaos. Moldovan regulators have prohibited passenger flights until at least the beginning of July. But even beforehand the start-up had run into problems with the Moldovan civil aviation authority. The authority stated in February that it had refused to issue HiSky with an air operator's certificate, for which it had applied the previous November, because it had no aircraft and had not provided sufficient documentation to support the application. It also openly questioned HiSky's decision to describe itself as an 'airline' and offer tickets on European routes, given that it did not have an air operator's certificate, and accusing the company of “misleading” customers. At the time HiSky had declared it planned to use a pair of A320s and operate under the IATA designator code '4H' with services beginning in April. All Moldovan airlines – with the exception of Air Moldova, FlyOne and Aerotranscargo – are blacklisted by the European Commission, and HiSky had stated that the new carrier would be formed through a partnership with Romanian Boeing 737-300 operator Cobrex Trans. HiSky has published a Moldovan civil aviation authority document, dated 7 April, approving a Cobrex Trans plan to operate on the six initial routes, but using its 737-300 registered YR-CBK, a 1992 airframe. Although HiSky states that its initial A320 is being dry-leased, and that it will be painted in HiSky colours, it has yet to clarify how the aircraft will be operated.",6,75,4.0,0.2966,"airport, fleet, service, data, carrier, operation, passenger, number, operate, operator","['startup', 'european', 'operator', 'hisky', 'moldova', 'agree', 'acquire', 'deal', 'u', 'lessor', 'lease', 'hisky', 'moldova', 'receive', 'use', 'july', 'accord', 'lessor', 'intend', 'operate', 'chisinau', 'base', 'initially', 'destination', 'include', 'london', 'paris', 'dublin', 'lisbon', 'bologna', 'dusseldorf', 'hisky', 'identify', 'airframe', 'power', 'international', 'aero', 'engine', 'originally', 'deliver', 'scoot', 'recently', 'use', 'italian', 'carrier', 'ernest', 'cease', 'operation', 'january', 'thrill', 'work', 'large', 'lease', 'world', 'assist', 'launch', 'say', 'hisky', 'chief', 'executive', 'iulian', 'scorpan', 'scorpan', 'former', 'head', 'flagcarrier', 'moldova', 'hisky', 'early', 'development', 'smooth', 'emerge', 'shortly', 'coronavirus', 'crisis', 'threw', 'european', 'transport', 'chaos', 'moldovan', 'regulator', 'prohibit', 'passenger', 'least', 'begin', 'july', 'even', 'beforehand', 'startup', 'run', 'problem', 'moldovan', 'civil', 'authority', 'authority', 'state', 'february', 'refuse', 'issue', 'hisky', 'operator', 'certificate', 'apply', 'previous', 'november', 'provide', 'sufficient', 'documentation', 'support', 'application', 'openly', 'question', 'hisky', 'decision', 'describe', 'offer', 'ticket', 'european', 'route', 'give', 'operator', 'certificate', 'accuse', 'mislead', 'customer', 'hisky', 'declare', 'plan', 'use', 'pair', 'operate', 'iata', 'designator', 'code', 'service', 'begin', 'april', 'moldovan', 'exception', 'moldova', 'flyone', 'aerotranscargo', 'blacklist', 'european', 'commission', 'hisky', 'state', 'carrier', 'form', 'partnership', 'romanian', 'operator', 'cobrex', 'trans', 'hisky', 'publish', 'moldovan', 'civil', 'authority', 'document', 'date', 'april', 'approve', 'cobrex', 'trans', 'plan', 'operate', 'initial', 'route', 'use', 'register', 'yrcbk', 'airframe', 'although', 'hisky', 'state', 'initial', 'dryleased', 'paint', 'hisky', 'colour', 'yet', 'clarify', 'operate']"
"Finnair has embarked on a €500 million rights issue which will centre on the release of up to 1.279 billion new shares in the company to strengthen its equity and liquidity. The issue carries conditions including limiting managers' salaries up to 2022 and restricting it from making acquisitions. Finnair will not be able to take more than a 10% share of companies in the same line of business for three years. There are pre-emptive rights for existing shareholders in the company, who will be able to apply for 10 additional shares for every share they already hold on 12 June. Subscription rights “cannot be exercised partially”, the carrier says. Finnair has disclosed that the subscription price is €0.40, putting the overall value of the shares at €511 million. The subscription period for the new shares will begin on 17 June and continue until 1 July. Finland's government – which is the majority shareholder in the airline, with a near-56% stake – will be able to participate in the share offering after a ruling from the European Commission over state aid. This ruling assumes that the government's shareholding in Finnair will not increase beyond “slight variations”, says the carrier. The government has committed to subscribe for its full allotment of shares, while finance firms Citigroup Global Markets and Nordea Bank will procure buyers for any unsubscribed shares. Finnair says it is “determined to continue on its long-term strategic path” despite the “temporary adjustments” it has had to make in relation to the coronavirus crisis. If the rights issue is fully exercised the total number of shares in the company will rise from 128.1 million to more than 1.4 billion.

"PALHoldings, the parent company of Philippine Airlines, has posted an operating loss of Ps6.55 billion ($131 million) for the first quarter of 2020, a sharp reversal of the Ps2.53 billion operating profit in the same period last year. Revenue for the quarter ended 31 March fell 18.3% year on year to Ps32 billion. The company attributes the revenue decline to the coronavirus pandemic, which has caused a sharp drop in passenger numbers and increased flight cancellations. The passenger segment accounts for the bulk of revenues and this fell 21.4%, to Ps27 billion, and cargo revenues declined 14%, to Ps1.89 billion. Meanwhile, ancillary revenue grew 18.7% to Ps3.16 billion. Expenses rose 5.2%, to Ps38.6 billion, led by an increase in costs associated with flying operations, particularly fuel hedging losses. Other operating expenses declined due to a reduced number of flights during the quarter. The company's net loss widened from Ps838 million to Ps9.38 billion. Cash and cash equivalents stood at Ps5.13 billion as at 31 March 2020, down from Ps9.29 billion on 31 March 2019. Philippine Airlines had 98 aircraft in its fleet at period end, a net increase of one aircraft over the previous quarter.

"Lockheed Martin F-35Bs from the Royal Air Force's (RAF's) frontline 617 Sqn have performed the unit's first landings aboard the aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth. Four of the UK's Lightning combat aircraft embarked aboard the Royal Navy (RN) vessel on 9 June. “The F-35 jets that landed on board today will be the same aircraft that will sail next year with the ship for her maiden Global Carrier Strike Group 21 deployment,” the navy says. “HMS Queen Elizabeth will now enter an intense period of flying,” the navy says. “The aim is to demonstrate that the jets can successfully defend the aircraft carrier by delivering combat air patrols...and being ready to take off at short notice.” To run until later this month, this activity also will involve “complex training missions” with Leonardo Helicopters AW101 Merlin HM2 rotorcraft from the RN's 820 NAS. 617 Sqn jets will redeploy aboard the 65,000t aircraft carrier later this year, as an RN task group participates in a multinational training exercise with NATO allies including the USA. The UK's first frontline F-35 Sqn, 617 Sqn is based at RAF Marham in Norfolk.

"India's aviation regulator has identified airprox incidents, runway incursions and unstable approaches among its eight safety priorities, following a spike in cases during 2018. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has also flagged in-flight loss of control as a new area of concern, following a two-fold increase in incidents. It notes that while there have been no fatal accidents involving commercial airliners under its jurisdiction, incidents involving the eight areas of concern have exceeded or breached targets. In 2018, there were 1.54 loss of control incidents per 10,000 departures, nearly twice the 0.64 incidents per 10,000 departures recorded the previous year. The DGCA classifies loss of control events as including low speed during approach and cruise; bank angle exceeding the maximum permitted; and windshear below 500ft. “Loss of control events have shown an increase and have emerged as an area of focus,” the DGCA states, but does not elaborate how it is intending to address the issue. The DGCA data also reveals an increase in the overall number of airprox incidents: during 2018, there were 16.2 cases per 1 million flights. Risk-bearing airprox incidents increased year on year, with number of cases exceeding targets set. In 2018, there were 2.76 such cases per 1 million flights, up from 2017's rate of 1.86 cases and above the DGCA's target of 1.8 incidents per 1 million flights. The agency notes, however, that the number of loss of separation incidents over Indian airspace has decreased. It adds that the main cause for airprox incidents are air traffic control or system failures. In 2018, there were about 14.5 incidents per 1 million flights, a marked increase from 2017's 8.17 cases. To this end, the DGCA has tasked the country's air navigation service provider with reviewing the figures and developing measures to address the rise in incidents. Unstable approaches also rose year on year to 7.79 incidents per 10,000 approaches, up on 2017's figure of 6.28, and above DGCA's target of 6.1 incidents per 10,000 approaches. Nearly all the aircraft involved in unstable approaches continued with their landing, it adds. The DGCA, which states it adopts a “non-punitive policy” towards go-arounds, adds: “All such occurrences are being investigated and corrective actions are being applied.” The agency has also flagged the rise in the number of runway incursions, particularly those caused by other aircraft and vehicles. 2018 saw 12.8 runway incursions by aircraft per 1 million aircraft movements, up from 7.95 in 2017. There were also 2.71 runway incursions caused by vehicles, a significant jump from 2017's 0.42 per 1 million aircraft movements. The DGCA identifies the three main causes as a loss of situational awareness by pilots, non-familiarisation with aerodrome layout, as well as complicated airport and/or taxiway design. Moving forward, the DGCA will increase safety training, as well as “performance based oversight which focuses on achieving the desired performance”. “This will lead to a more active involvement and interaction of all players in managing the aviation safety system,” it adds.",6,79,7.0,0.3298,"crew, runway, inquiry, land, approach, accident, investigator, captain, incident, pilot","['india', 'regulator', 'identify', 'airprox', 'incident', 'runway', 'incursion', 'unstable', 'approach', 'among', 'safety', 'priority', 'follow', 'spike', 'case', 'directorate', 'general', 'civil', 'dgca', 'flag', 'inflight', 'loss', 'control', 'area', 'concern', 'follow', 'twofold', 'increase', 'incident', 'note', 'fatal', 'accident', 'involve', 'commercial', 'airliner', 'jurisdiction', 'incident', 'involve', 'area', 'concern', 'exceed', 'breach', 'target', 'loss', 'control', 'incident', 'per', 'departure', 'nearly', 'twice', 'incident', 'per', 'departure', 'record', 'previous', 'dgca', 'classifies', 'loss', 'control', 'event', 'include', 'low', 'speed', 'approach', 'cruise', 'bank', 'angle', 'exceed', 'maximum', 'permit', 'windshear', 'loss', 'control', 'event', 'increase', 'emerge', 'area', 'focus', 'dgca', 'state', 'elaborate', 'intend', 'address', 'issue', 'dgca', 'data', 'reveals', 'increase', 'overall', 'number', 'airprox', 'incident', 'case', 'per', 'riskbearing', 'airprox', 'incident', 'increase', 'number', 'case', 'exceed', 'target', 'set', 'case', 'per', 'rate', 'case', 'dgca', 'target', 'incident', 'per', 'agency', 'note', 'however', 'number', 'loss', 'separation', 'incident', 'indian', 'airspace', 'decrease', 'add', 'main', 'cause', 'airprox', 'incident', 'traffic', 'control', 'system', 'failure', 'incident', 'per', 'marked', 'increase', 'case', 'end', 'dgca', 'tasked', 'country', 'navigation', 'service', 'provider', 'review', 'figure', 'develop', 'measure', 'address', 'rise', 'incident', 'unstable', 'approach', 'rise', 'incident', 'per', 'approach', 'figure', 'dgca', 'target', 'incident', 'per', 'approach', 'nearly', 'involve', 'unstable', 'approach', 'continued', 'land', 'add', 'dgca', 'state', 'adopts', 'nonpunitive', 'policy', 'towards', 'goarounds', 'add', 'occurrence', 'investigate', 'corrective', 'action', 'agency', 'flag', 'rise', 'number', 'runway', 'incursion', 'particularly', 'cause', 'vehicle', 'saw', 'runway', 'incursion', 'per', 'movement', 'runway', 'incursion', 'cause', 'vehicle', 'significant', 'jump', 'per', 'movement', 'dgca', 'identifies', 'main', 'cause', 'loss', 'situational', 'awareness', 'pilot', 'nonfamiliarisation', 'aerodrome', 'layout', 'well', 'complicate', 'airport', 'taxiway', 'design', 'move', 'forward', 'dgca', 'increase', 'safety', 'training', 'well', 'performance', 'base', 'oversight', 'focus', 'achieve', 'desire', 'performance', 'lead', 'active', 'involvement', 'interaction', 'player', 'manage', 'safety', 'system', 'add']"
"The union representing US flight attendants has called on Congress to extend government financial assistance for airlines through the end of the year. The payroll support program, part of the CARES Act passed by Congress in March, designed to help airlines manage through the coronavirus crisis, runs out on 30 September. In return for $25 billion in government support, airlines agreed to maintain a network of skeleton service and pledged no involuntary layoffs or furloughs until that date. But the Association of Flight Attendants says this is not enough time for the airlines to get back on stable financial footing following the pandemic. The union has asked for Congress to extend the programme through the end of 2020 in order to avoid mass layoffs at the end of September if passenger demand does not return. “The programme is set to expire on September 30th and the time to prepare for October 1 is now,” Susannah Carr, a United Airlines flight attendant and union representative, tells a hearing of the US House of Representatives' Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure on 9 June. “When CARES was written it was expected the industry would be closer to full recovery by the fall. It is clear now, that will not happen. At a minimum, Congress should extend the program through the New Year,” Carr says. So far, about 40,000 flight attendants across the US, or 35% of the country's flight attendant workforce have taken voluntary leave offered by their airlines, she adds. Major US airlines are still running significantly reduced operations, though many have said they have seen a small uptick in bookings as lockdowns and shelter-in-place orders across the country are being eased. But United has told employees that it will likely only need about 15% of its flight attendant workforce for the month of June. It is unclear when and how travel demand will return, making it almost impossible for airlines to plan beyond a few weeks out. United received about $5 billion of government payroll aid. Airline trade industry group Airlines for America (A4A) and pilots' union Air Line Pilots' Association, International (ALPA) did not respond to requests for comment on the testimony. SAFETY Safey issues and protection from the virus remain important issues in travelers' decision-making process of whether they will return to the air and if so, when. The flight attendants' union also says airlines are not doing enough to inspire passengers' confidence to return to air travel. Calling the coronavirus pandemic “the biggest crisis aviation has ever faced” Carr says that “a hodge-podge of individual voluntarily-adopted measures” by airlines have put workers and passengers at risk of becoming sick. She encouraged Congress to pass emergency safety and health rules that would mandate airlines abide by “enforceable, mandatory, national standards” including additional cleaning protocols, social distancing measures and requiring all passengers to wear face coverings. “It is clear to anyone working a flight that the current environment of inconsistent and voluntary airline policies is not working as it should,” Carr says. “These airline policies and practices are poorly communicated to crew and passengers alike, leaving flight attendants to risk our health and safety while attempting to manage the otherwise avoidable conflicts that result,” she adds.",6,80,12.0,0.3029,"travel, government, country, coronavirus, measure, restriction, passenger, state, march, canada","['union', 'represent', 'u', 'attendant', 'call', 'congress', 'extend', 'government', 'financial', 'assistance', 'end', 'payroll', 'support', 'program', 'part', 'care', 'act', 'pass', 'congress', 'march', 'design', 'help', 'manage', 'coronavirus', 'crisis', 'run', 'september', 'return', 'government', 'support', 'agree', 'maintain', 'network', 'skeleton', 'service', 'pledge', 'involuntary', 'layoff', 'furlough', 'date', 'association', 'attendant', 'say', 'enough', 'get', 'back', 'stable', 'financial', 'footing', 'follow', 'pandemic', 'union', 'ask', 'congress', 'extend', 'programme', 'end', 'order', 'avoid', 'mass', 'layoff', 'end', 'september', 'passenger', 'demand', 'return', 'programme', 'set', 'expire', 'september', 'prepare', 'october', 'susannah', 'carr', 'united', 'attendant', 'union', 'representative', 'tell', 'hearing', 'u', 'house', 'representative', 'committee', 'transportation', 'infrastructure', 'june', 'care', 'write', 'expect', 'industry', 'closer', 'full', 'recovery', 'fall', 'clear', 'happen', 'minimum', 'congress', 'extend', 'program', 'carr', 'say', 'far', 'attendant', 'across', 'u', 'country', 'attendant', 'workforce', 'take', 'voluntary', 'leave', 'offer', 'add', 'major', 'u', 'still', 'run', 'significantly', 'reduce', 'operation', 'though', 'many', 'say', 'see', 'small', 'uptick', 'booking', 'lockdown', 'shelterinplace', 'order', 'across', 'country', 'ease', 'united', 'told', 'employee', 'likely', 'need', 'attendant', 'workforce', 'month', 'june', 'unclear', 'travel', 'demand', 'return', 'make', 'almost', 'impossible', 'plan', 'beyond', 'week', 'united', 'receive', 'government', 'payroll', 'aid', 'trade', 'industry', 'america', 'pilot', 'union', 'line', 'pilot', 'association', 'international', 'alpa', 'respond', 'request', 'comment', 'testimony', 'safety', 'safey', 'issue', 'protection', 'virus', 'remain', 'important', 'issue', 'traveler', 'decisionmaking', 'process', 'whether', 'return', 'attendant', 'union', 'say', 'enough', 'inspire', 'passenger', 'confidence', 'return', 'travel', 'call', 'coronavirus', 'pandemic', 'big', 'crisis', 'ever', 'face', 'carr', 'say', 'hodgepodge', 'individual', 'voluntarilyadopted', 'measure', 'put', 'worker', 'passenger', 'risk', 'become', 'sick', 'encourage', 'congress', 'pas', 'emergency', 'safety', 'health', 'rule', 'mandate', 'abide', 'enforceable', 'mandatory', 'national', 'standard', 'include', 'additional', 'cleaning', 'protocol', 'social', 'distance', 'measure', 'require', 'passenger', 'wear', 'face', 'covering', 'clear', 'anyone', 'work', 'current', 'environment', 'inconsistent', 'voluntary', 'policy', 'work', 'carr', 'say', 'policy', 'practice', 'poorly', 'communicate', 'crew', 'passenger', 'alike', 'leave', 'attendant', 'risk', 'health', 'safety', 'attempt', 'manage', 'otherwise', 'avoidable', 'conflict', 'result', 'add']"
"As the US air transport industry begins emerging from the pandemic-induced disruption, airlines are making difficult decisions about how to right-size for the current environment while maintaining their ability to quickly rebuild as demand returns. Many have announced staff reductions across the board, including for pilots, who require a high level of initial and recurrent training in order to pursue those careers. Industry observers expect the sector to contract by about 30% in the short term, and a bounce-back could take up to five years. This is leading to anxiety, frustration and resignation among professional pilots and those who had hoped to pursue a commercial aviation career. The pilot shortage that the industry had long planned for is, for the moment, on hold. “It's no secret that this industry is not stable,” says Cameron Lampert, a 27-year-old certified flight instructor in California who wanted to make the jump to being a regional carrier pilot later this year. “Anyone who wants to get to the airlines now will probably need two to three times as long.” But the coronavirus, after bringing global aviation to a near standstill, will not stop the thousands of anticipated pilot retirements in the coming years. A mandatory retirement age of 65 will thin the ranks, forcing airlines to walk a tightrope when it comes to furloughing, recruiting and replacing pilots. They need to bring costs down significantly to match their now-smaller operations, but also must ensure they do not completely choke off the pipeline of candidates later. Last year, United Airlines launched its “Aviate” pilot recruiting programme, conceived to train up to 10,000 new pilots in the next ten years. The airline says that plan is still on track, despite the downturn, as it attempts to replace the 400-800 pilots it expects to lose to attrition annually. “We are taking advantage of this pause to not have to run so fast,“ says Curtis Brunjes, a 787 captain and United's managing director of pilot strategy. “The demand is still there, it's just depressed a bit in the short term because of the Covid crisis. The long-term value proposition for new people coming in remains unchanged. Aviation is still an attractive career.” Since March, some airlines have cut back on bringing in pilot candidates, and working pilots in the lower third of airlines' all-important seniority lists are preparing for a day later this year when they may have to find another job. In April, US commercial carriers took US government financial assistance through the CARES Act, designed to help airlines maintain operations even as passenger demand fell to near zero. In return for the aid, airlines promised no furloughs or job cuts until the end of September. Many have already offered employees generous buyout schemes, early retirement options or long-term leaves in order to preserve liquidity and manage cash burn. LONG ROAD TO THE COCKPIT It usually takes about seven to eight years of training and a sizable financial investment to advance to a US commercial airline's cockpit, says Elizabeth Tennyson, executive director of “You Can Fly”, an initiative launched by the Aircraft Owners and Pilots' Association (AOPA) to make aviation more accessible to a wider swath of the population. The cost of this training varies, and could be as high as $100,000. The path to becoming an airline pilot in the USA became more rigorous following a 2013 rule that in most cases requires commercial pilots have at least 1,500h of flight time before joining a passenger or cargo carrier, up from 250h. “People who do this have to love it,” Tennyson says. So commercial pilots who are nowhere near retirement age worry that the careers they spent so much time, money and effort to build may just disappear if, as expected, furloughs and layoffs kick in later this year. “As major airlines look at ways to salvage or save their own pockets, the pilot group is the first on the cutting block,” says a pilot with a major US carrier who asked to remain anonymous due to the sensitivity of the topic.The ripple effect after September will have long-lasting detrimental effects on careers and livelihoods, even if the industry rebounds more quickly, the pilot adds. Already today – more than three months before the government deadline – airlines are exploring loopholes that could allow them to cut costs while ensuring they do not violate stipulations in the CARES Act. Announced displacements, accelerated aircraft retirements and the folding of regional carriers Trans States Airlines and Compass Airlines are contributing to pilots' general angst about the immediate future. AOPA's Tennyson says the situation can be compared to the downturn after the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks almost 20 years ago. “At the time we saw a lot of people move on to other professions,” she says. “So it's reasonable to expect that some pilots will return to another aviation career, like teaching, but others will go on to do different things.” That uncertainty, however, does have a flip side that could benefit the next generation of aviators, Tennyson says. “What we are hearing from flight schools is that within about a month of going back to work they have about as many students as they had prior to this,” she adds. With airlines delaying hiring many flight school instructors who were headed to the airlines, like Lampert in California, are now staying put. “We all know the business is cyclical, but the scale of this thing is unprecedented,” Lampert says. “I plan to instruct for the rest of my life, and if I don't get to the airlines, that's okay too.”",6,81,9.0,0.2319,"industry, crisis, demand, coronavirus,

"A battery fire inside a FedEx truck in 2016 has led the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) to recommend tighter regulation of some lithium-ion batteries. The NTSB released recommendations on 8 June stemming from the 2016 fire, which ignited while the truck's driver was delivering packages in Ontario, Canada. The fire destroyed the truck and its contents. The batteries ignited about 10h after being offloaded from a cargo aircraft in Ontario. The batteries had been transported there from Sarasota, Florida on two FedEx cargo aircraft, the NTSB says. FedEx jets carried the lithium-ion batteries that ignited shortly after being unloaded in Ontario, Canada in 2016 Its recommendations target a special class of “low-production or prototype” lithium-ion batteries that can be exempted from the more-rigorous safety tests that apply to other lithium-ion batteries. “The NTSB concludes that had the thermal runaway event occurred on an airplane, the event could have resulted in significant damage to, or the loss of the airplane,” says the NTSB's Safety Recommendation Report. “Through international cooperation with Canadian authorities, we've uncovered a safety gap in how certain lithium-ion batteries are allowed to be transported,” says NTSB's director of hazardous materials investigations Robert Hall. The NTSB is asking the Department of Transportation's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration to ask ICAO to remove a special exemption that permits low-production or prototype lithium-ion batteries to be exempted from the more rigorous tests. US regulators must make the request to ICAO because US law prohibits US standards from being more stringent than ICAO standards. ICAO generally requires lithium-ion batteries, prior to being transported by air, be tested for their response to vibrations, overcharging, short circuiting and varying pressures and temperatures. But exempted low-production and prototype lithium-ion batteries need only pass a short-circuit test. If ICAO removes the exemption, the NTSB then recommends that US regulators also strike the exemption from US regulations. Braille Battery, which made the batteries that ignited the FedEx truck, did not actually apply for the exemption. Therefore, those batteries were subject to the more-complete tests, but Braille could not prove that the batteries had undergone the tests. Investigators also faulted the company for shipping the batteries in combustible packaging, which violated separate US regulations. But the NTSB says the Braille batteries could have met the standard for the “low-production or prototype” testing exemption. It says the less-stringent short-circuit test might not have identified the fault that caused the fire. The NTSB identified a separate, similar incident in which batteries caught fire in 2004 prior to being loaded on a FedEx aircraft in Memphis. ICAO deferred comment about the NTSB's report to the FAA. But, ICAO says any change to its standards would need to come at the “discretion of the other 192 countries” that cooperate through the organisation. “Aviation functions internationally on the basis of a longstanding and very effective system of diplomatic and technical consensus which governments count on us to support,” ICAO says. The FAA's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration says it will “review the [NTSB's] recommendations and respond appropriately”. “Safety is the department's top priority,” it adds.",6,82,11.0,0.3712,"pilot, faa, issue, safety, include, report, require, training, ground, order","['battery', 'fire', 'inside', 'fedex', 'truck', 'lead', 'national', 'transportation', 'safety', 'board', 'ntsb', 'recommend', 'tighter', 'regulation', 'lithiumion', 'battery', 'ntsb', 'release', 'recommendation', 'june', 'stem', 'fire', 'ignite', 'truck', 'driver', 'deliver', 'package', 'ontario', 'canada', 'fire', 'destroyed', 'truck', 'content', 'battery', 'ignite', 'offload', 'cargo', 'ontario', 'battery', 'transport', 'sarasota', 'florida', 'fedex', 'cargo', 'ntsb', 'say', 'fedex', 'jet', 'carry', 'lithiumion', 'battery', 'ignite', 'shortly', 'unloaded', 'ontario', 'canada', 'recommendation', 'target', 'special', 'class', 'lowproduction', 'prototype', 'lithiumion', 'battery', 'exempt', 'morerigorous', 'safety', 'test', 'apply', 'lithiumion', 'battery', 'ntsb', 'concludes', 'thermal', 'runaway', 'event', 'occur', 'airplane', 'event', 'result', 'significant', 'damage', 'loss', 'airplane', 'say', 'ntsb', 'safety', 'recommendation', 'report', 'international', 'cooperation', 'canadian', 'authority', 'uncovered', 'safety', 'gap', 'certain', 'lithiumion', 'battery', 'allow', 'transport', 'say', 'ntsb', 'director', 'hazardous', 'material', 'investigation', 'robert', 'hall', 'ntsb', 'ask', 'department', 'transportation', 'pipeline', 'hazardous', 'material', 'safety', 'administration', 'ask', 'icao', 'remove', 'special', 'exemption', 'permit', 'lowproduction', 'prototype', 'lithiumion', 'battery', 'exempt', 'rigorous', 'test', 'u', 'regulator', 'must', 'make', 'request', 'icao', 'u', 'law', 'prohibits', 'u', 'standard', 'stringent', 'icao', 'standard', 'icao', 'generally', 'require', 'lithiumion', 'battery', 'prior', 'transport', 'test', 'response', 'vibration', 'overcharge', 'short', 'circuit', 'vary', 'pressure', 'temperature', 'exempt', 'lowproduction', 'prototype', 'lithiumion', 'battery', 'need', 'pas', 'shortcircuit', 'test', 'icao', 'remove', 'exemption', 'ntsb', 'recommends', 'u', 'regulator', 'strike', 'exemption', 'u', 'regulation', 'braille', 'battery', 'make', 'battery', 'ignite', 'fedex', 'truck', 'actually', 'apply', 'exemption', 'therefore', 'battery', 'subject', 'morecomplete', 'test', 'braille', 'prove', 'battery', 'undergone', 'test', 'investigator', 'fault', 'shipping', 'battery', 'combustible', 'packaging', 'violate', 'separate', 'u', 'regulation', 'ntsb', 'say', 'braille', 'battery', 'met', 'standard', 'lowproduction', 'prototype', 'test', 'exemption', 'say', 'lessstringent', 'shortcircuit', 'test', 'might', 'identify', 'fault', 'cause', 'fire', 'ntsb', 'identify', 'separate', 'similar', 'incident', 'battery', 'caught', 'fire', 'prior', 'load', 'fedex', 'memphis', 'icao', 'defer', 'comment', 'ntsb', 'report', 'faa', 'icao', 'say', 'change', 'standard', 'need', 'come', 'discretion', 'country', 'cooperate', 'organisation', 'function', 'internationally', 'basis', 'longstanding', 'effective', 'system', 'diplomatic', 'technical', 'consensus', 'government', 'count', 'u', 'support', 'icao', 'say', 'faa', 'pipeline', 'hazardous', 'material', 'safety', 'administration', 'say', 'review', 'ntsb', 'recommendation', 'respond', 'appropriately', 'safety', 'department', 'top', 'priority', 'add']"
"Experienced airline executives Jaan Albrecht and Chris Browne, together with Aercap's chief risk officer Anton Joiner are among nominations to join the board at Norwegian. In a notice to shareholders ahead of its annual general meeting on 30 June, Norwegian has proposed four nominations for election to its board, together with the proposed re-election of Sonder Gravir. Two existing members of the board, Liv Berstad and Christain Fredrik Stray, are stepping down. The nominations include Albrecht, who after 10 years at the helm of Star Alliance, has served as chief executive of Austrian Airlines, SunExpress and, most recently, Saudia. Albrecht's biography published on the Norwegian website shows he served as chief executive of the Saudi Arabian carrier until the end of 2019 and remains an advisor to the chairman. Former TUI chief operating officer Browne served in the same role at EasyJet between 2015 and 2019, before stepping down for personal reasons. Joiner is chief risk officer at aircraft lessor AerCap. The latter holds a 15.9% stake in Norwegian following the debt-for-equity restructuring Norwegian completed in May, a process which helped secure critical state aid. AerCap chief executive Aengus Kelly has also been proposed to join the airline's nomination committee, from which former chairman Bjorn Kise is stepping down. Lessors including BOC Aviation and Avolon are also among lessors to have converted lease obligations into shares in Norwegian as part of the recent debt conversion plan.

"Ryanair-owned Lauda has cancelled plans to close its Vienna base after the majority of pilots and cabin crew backed a new collective labour agreement. Services will resume on 1 July with three Airbus A320s based at the airport, rising to 10 by August. Originally, Lauda intended to base 16 A320s in the Austrian capital for the summer 2020 season, but this plan has been scaled back because of the coronavirus crisis. ”Lauda will reopen in Vienna in July with lower aircraft costs, lower airport costs, and a more efficient CLA,” says the carrier. On 29 May, Lauda said it was shutting down its Vienna base after failing to reach a pay deal with crew. The plan was for Ryan air to expand at the airport instead of Lauda, but this has now been abandoned. The Austrian carrier says it has “confirmed there will still be some job losses among pilots and cabin crew” but that these will be “significantly reduced thanks to the weekend vote of pilots and cabin crew”. Lauda adds that 90% of pilots and 66% of cabin crew backed the new collective labour agreement.",6,84,4.0,0.311,"airport, fleet, service, data, carrier, operation, passenger, number, operate, operator","['ryanairowned', 'lauda', 'cancel', 'plan', 'close', 'vienna', 'base', 'majority', 'pilot', 'cabin', 'crew', 'back', 'collective', 'labour', 'agreement', 'service', 'resume', 'july', 'base', 'airport', 'rise', 'august', 'originally', 'lauda', 'intend', 'base', 'austrian', 'capital', 'summer', 'season', 'plan', 'scale', 'back', 'coronavirus', 'crisis', 'lauda', 'reopen', 'vienna', 'july', 'low', 'cost', 'low', 'airport', 'cost', 'efficient', 'cla', 'say', 'carrier', 'may', 'lauda', 'say', 'shut', 'vienna', 'base', 'fail', 'reach', 'pay', 'deal', 'crew', 'plan', 'ryan', 'expand', 'airport', 'instead', 'lauda', 'abandon', 'austrian', 'carrier', 'say', 'confirm', 'still', 'job', 'loss', 'among', 'pilot', 'cabin', 'crew', 'significantly', 'reduce', 'thanks', 'weekend', 'vote', 'pilot', 'cabin', 'crew', 'lauda', 'add', 'pilot', 'cabin', 'crew', 'back', 'collective', 'labour', 'agreement']"
"Boeing received new orders for six 767 Freighters in May, though the company's aircraft backlog declined by 90 jets in the month due largely to order cancellations and other negative adjustments. The cancellations included 14 737 Max that had been ordered by several lessors and unidentified customers. The results reflect another month hampered by the industry downturn spurred by coronavirus, which has deflated new-aircraft demand and hindered carriers' ability to take delivery of newly-produced jets. Boeing delivered four aircraft in May. The airframer actually logged nine new aircraft orders in the month, though three of those orders were transferred between customers and had already been in Boeing's backlog. The six new 767Fs orders in May include one aircraft added by longtime 767-operator FedEx and five jets ordered by a customer or customers that remain unnamed.  A FedEx Boeing 767-300 Freighter Those 767F orders bring Boeing's backlog of that type to 91 jets – enough to maintain about 2.5 years of production at Boeing's current three-767-monthly production rate. The other three new orders included one 747-8F ordered by UPS and two 777Fs ordered by unidentified buyers. Those three jets were already in Boeing's backlog, assigned to Russian cargo company Volga-Dnepr's UK affiliate, Volga-Dnepr UK. Boeing resold them after Volga-Dnepr UK signalled its inability to take deliveries due to the coronavirus downturn, according to court papers. Volga-Dnepr UK, which later reversed course and sought to take deliveries, asked a judge this month to block Boeing's resales. A judge denied the request. In transferring the single 747-8F from Volga-Dnepr to UPS, Boeing also removed one 747-8F from UPS's existing backlog, for zero impact on UPS's backlog, it says. UPS holds 13 outstanding 747-8F orders, according to Cirium fleets data. The 14 737 Max cancellations included three aircraft ordered by Aviation Capital Group, one ordered by CIT Aerospace, four ordered by GE Capital Aviation Services and six jets ordered by unidentified customers. Since the start of 2020, Boeing has received orders for 58 jets, but cancellations and conversions bring the figure to negative 264. Boeing removed 77 other aircraft from its backlog in May to meet accounting standards. Those aircraft remain under sales contracts but Boeing, based on factors such as market conditions, credit availability and customers' financial health, has less confidence the sales will close. As a result, Boeing's backlog stood at 4,744 aircraft at the end of May, including 3,776 737s, 13 747s, 91 767s, 355 777s and 509 787s, the company says. The backlog is down from 4,834 jets at the end of April. The four jets Boeing delivered in May included one 737NG-based maritime surveillance jet, one 767F and two 777Fs. The low delivery figure reflects the coronavirus downturn, which has reduced demand for new jets.

"IATA is projecting airlines will post their largest ever collective net loss this year, totalling $84.3 billion, and will remain in the red in 2021, as the association made its first projection of the scale of industry losses since the coronavirus crisis hit. The airline association had already indicated global passenger traffic this year would be roughly half 2019 levels as lockdowns and travel restrictions brought international passenger services to a virtual standstill in the second quarter. IATA today estimated a collective industry net loss of $84 billion for 2020. The figure, which surpasses the $30 billion loss made during the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009, confirms the extent of losses suffered by airlines during the crisis and brings a 10-year run of profits to an end. IATA had in December projected industry profits could reach almost $30 billion this year. The $84.3 billion loss virtually wipes out the $91.3 billion net profits the industry posted over the past three years. Airlines in all regions will suffer. IATA estimates net losses will represent negative margins of between 15-30% of revenues across the different regions in 2020.  While IATA expects a sharp improvement in passenger demand in 2021, albeit still below 2019 levels, a tough cost and yield environment will keep airlines in the red. Detailing the latest outlook, IATA chief economist Brian Pearce explains: ”In this particular forecast we have taken a view that Covid-19 will steadily be contained, so we have not built in a second wave of Covid. ”We are basing it on a phased opening of markets, but have been rather cautious on the return of business travel and passenger confidence, and have built in the impact of the recession, which will damage the ability of people to travel. ”We are still expecting to see a significant rise of revenues in 2021, that will allow airlines to substantially reduce their losses, but we wouldn't expect to see those losses eliminated in 2021. We are still expecting net losses of $15.8 billion.”  He adds: ”That is a similar pattern to the one we saw in the global financial crisis in 2008 and 2009. Obviously much larger, but if you look back at that period, the depth of the crisis, followed by a better performance but still a loss, before a recovery in the subsequent years.” ”We haven't put out a forecast beyond 2021.

Cathay, which has been hard hit by a collapse in travel demand from the coronavirus outbreak, states that the recapitalisation plan - if approved by shareholders - will comprise three tranches. In the first, it will issue HK$19.5 billion in preference shares to Aviation 2020 – a limited company wholly owned by the government – for an undisclosed stake. Aviation 2020 will also provide a HK$7.8 billion bridge loan facility to Cathay – the subject of the third tranche. In the second tranche, Cathay will launch a HK$11.7 billion rights issue of shares to its existing shareholders. The bailout also marks the first time the Hong Kong government has stepped in to rescue a private company. Conglomerate Swire Pacific owns 45% of the Cathay Pacific Group, with Air China holding nearly 30%. Cathay discloses that the recapitalisation plan was drawn up after exploring “available options”, and adds that it was necessary “to ensure it has sufficient liquidity to weather this current crisis”. “In addition, it is expected to place Cathay Pacific in a better position to compete vigorously and to capitalise on any opportunities that may arise as a result of the current crisis and should position Cathay Pacific for growth when the crisis resolves,” the carrier adds. Cathay chairman Patrick Healy adds that the carrier has been losing cash rapidly for the past four months, even as it made attempts to conserve cash. Since February, when the coronavirus outbreak became more widespread, Cathay has lost around HK$2.5 to HK$3 billion in cash a month. Passenger revenue for the period also collapsed to just 1% of what it used to earn in past years. In May, Cathay disclosed that it and sister carrier Cathay Dragon had jointly made a HK$4.5 billion loss for the first four months of the year. It had earlier flagged a “substantial loss” for the first half of the year, due in large part to the coronavirus outbreak. Cathay's announcement of the recapitalisation plan comes the same day as it announced a fresh round of pay cuts for its senior executives and a second round of voluntary special leave scheme for its employees. In the longer term, Cathay says that its business model “will be re-evaluated”. By the end of this year, Cathay's management will make recommendations to its board on the “optimum size and shape” of the group. “Inevitably this will involve rationalisation of future planned capacity compared to the pre-crisis plans, taking into account the market outlook and cost structure at that time,” it adds. Earlier in the day, Cathay, Swire Pacific and Air China all halted trading on Hong Kong's stock exchange, pending the release of the announcement. Cathay's announcement comes two weeks before it was due to hold its Annual General Meeting, which was postponed from May due to social distancing laws in place in Hong Kong.",6,87,5.0,0.2843,"carrier, march, international, outbreak, suspend, capacity, schedule, april, united, coronavirus","['hong', 'kong', 'government', 'step', 'provide', 'beleaguer', 'cathay', 'pacific', 'financial', 'lifeline', 'part', 'hk', 'recapitalisation', 'plan', 'cathay', 'hard', 'hit', 'collapse', 'travel', 'demand', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'state', 'recapitalisation', 'plan', 'approve', 'shareholder', 'comprise', 'tranche', 'issue', 'hk', 'preference', 'share', 'limited', 'wholly', 'government', 'undisclosed', 'stake', 'provide', 'hk', 'bridge', 'loan', 'facility', 'cathay', 'subject', 'third', 'tranche', 'second', 'tranche', 'cathay', 'launch', 'hk', 'right', 'issue', 'share', 'exist', 'shareholder', 'bailout', 'mark', 'hong', 'kong', 'government', 'step', 'rescue', 'private', 'conglomerate', 'swire', 'pacific', 'cathay', 'pacific', 'hold', 'nearly', 'cathay', 'discloses', 'recapitalisation', 'plan', 'drawn', 'explore', 'available', 'option', 'add', 'necessary', 'ensure', 'sufficient', 'liquidity', 'weather', 'current', 'crisis', 'addition', 'expect', 'place', 'cathay', 'pacific', 'well', 'position', 'compete', 'vigorously', 'capitalise', 'opportunity', 'may', 'arise', 'result', 'current', 'crisis', 'position', 'cathay', 'pacific', 'growth', 'crisis', 'resolve', 'carrier', 'add', 'cathay', 'chairman', 'patrick', 'healy', 'add', 'carrier', 'lose', 'cash', 'rapidly', 'past', 'month', 'even', 'make', 'attempt', 'conserve', 'cash', 'since', 'february', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'become', 'widespread', 'cathay', 'lose', 'around', 'hk', 'hk', 'cash', 'month', 'passenger', 'revenue', 'period', 'collapse', 'use', 'earn', 'past', 'may', 'cathay', 'disclose', 'sister', 'carrier', 'cathay', 'dragon', 'jointly', 'make', 'hk', 'loss', 'month', 'earlier', 'flag', 'substantial', 'loss', 'half', 'due', 'large', 'part', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'cathay', 'announcement', 'recapitalisation', 'plan', 'come', 'day', 'announce', 'fresh', 'round', 'pay', 'cut', 'senior', 'executive', 'second', 'round', 'voluntary', 'special', 'leave', 'scheme', 'employee', 'longer', 'term', 'cathay', 'say', 'business', 'model', 'reevaluate', 'end', 'cathay', 'management', 'make', 'recommendation', 'board', 'optimum', 'size', 'shape', 'inevitably', 'involve', 'rationalisation', 'future', 'plan', 'capacity', 'compare', 'precrisis', 'plan', 'take', 'account', 'market', 'outlook', 'cost', 'structure', 'add', 'earlier', 'day', 'cathay', 'swire', 'pacific', 'halt', 'trading', 'hong', 'kong', 'stock', 'exchange', 'pending', 'release', 'announcement', 'cathay', 'announcement', 'come', 'week', 'due', 'hold', 'annual', 'general', 'meeting', 'postpone', 'may', 'due', 'social', 'distance', 'law', 'place', 'hong', 'kong']"
"Thai Airways International has proposed appointing an additional person with state-owned enterprise credentials to join the five other people, as well as a professional services firm, tasked with drafting a turnaround plan for its beleagured business. The Thai flag carrier, which had its application for business rehabilitation accepted by a court on 27 May, wants former president and chief executive of Thai oil and gas company PTT, Chansin Treenuchagron, to become a rehabilitation planner. The airline had appointed him to its board on 4 June, though it did not announce his appointment until 8 June. Treenuchagron took the helm of state-owned PTT in August 2018, and served as president and chief executive until May 2020, according to his profile on the company's website. Treenuchagron replaces Pailin Chuchottaworn, another former PTT president and chief executive, who resigned from Thai's board after just one day following his 25 May appointment. Chuchottaworn had resigned over “potential legal worries”, as he was a deputy transport minister from November 2017 to December 2019. The country's National Anti-Corruption Commission bars a cabinet minister from sitting on the board of a private company for two years after leaving the cabinet, according to a 27 May report by The Bangkok Post. Meanwhile, the airline's legal advisor Kitipong Urapeepatanapong told a news briefing that the rehabilitation timeframe would be five years, extendable by two years, according to an 8 June report by Reuters. “The Thai Airways rehabilitation plan should conclude within seven years, which can include debt to equity conversions, selling assets or an equity injection,” he says.",6,88,8.0,0.2525,"government, uk, carrier, business, state, share, south, airway, financial, plan","['thai', 'airway', 'international', 'propose', 'appoint', 'additional', 'person', 'stateowned', 'enterprise', 'credential', 'join', 'people', 'well', 'professional', 'service', 'firm', 'tasked', 'draft', 'turnaround', 'plan', 'beleagured', 'business', 'thai', 'flag', 'carrier', 'application', 'business', 'rehabilitation', 'accepted', 'court', 'may', 'want', 'former', 'president', 'chief', 'executive', 'thai', 'oil', 'gas', 'ptt', 'chansin', 'treenuchagron', 'become', 'rehabilitation', 'planner', 'appoint', 'board', 'june', 'though', 'announce', 'appointment', 'june', 'treenuchagron', 'take', 'helm', 'stateowned', 'ptt', 'august', 'serve', 'president', 'chief', 'executive', 'may', 'accord', 'profile', 'website', 'treenuchagron', 'replaces', 'pailin', 'chuchottaworn', 'another', 'former', 'ptt', 'president', 'chief', 'executive', 'resign', 'thai', 'board', 'day', 'follow', 'may', 'appointment', 'chuchottaworn', 'resign', 'potential', 'legal', 'worry', 'deputy', 'transport', 'minister', 'november', 'december', 'country', 'national', 'anticorruption', 'commission', 'bar', 'cabinet', 'minister', 'sit', 'board', 'private', 'leave', 'cabinet', 'accord', 'may', 'report', 'bangkok', 'post', 'meanwhile', 'legal', 'advisor', 'kitipong', 'urapeepatanapong', 'told', 'news', 'briefing', 'rehabilitation', 'timeframe', 'extendable', 'accord', 'june', 'report', 'reuters', 'thai', 'airway', 'rehabilitation', 'plan', 'conclude', 'within', 'include', 'debt', 'equity', 'conversion', 'sell', 'asset', 'equity', 'injection', 'say']"
"British Airways, EasyJet and Ryanair have started legal proceedings against the UK government over the introduction of a mandatory 14-day quarantine measure for travellers arriving in the country from 8 June. The three carriers sent a pre-action protocol letter to the government on 5 June, describing the measure as “disproportionate and unfair on British citizens as well as international visitors arriving in the UK”. Under the new rules, all arriving passengers – bar those covered by a short list of exemptions – will be required to self-isolate for 14 days. Failure to comply will be “punishable with a £1,000 [$1,270] fixed-penalty notice in England or potential prosecution and unlimited fine”, says the UK Home Office. It is unclear how the measure will be enforced in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales, a point raised by the three airlines. “We challenge the UK government on a number of defective measures,” say British Airways, EasyJet and Ryanair in a joint statement. These include “the fact that this quarantine is more stringent than the guidelines applied to people who actually have Covid-19”, the airlines note, and that “if you live in Scotland, to date, the rules won't apply”. The joint statement also notes that commuters to the UK from European Union member states such as France and Germany “will be exempted”, and questions the logic of “banning people from countries with lower R rates [the rate at which the virus spreads] than the UK”. Calling for abandonment of the quarantine measure, the airlines argue it would “have a devastating effect on UK's tourism industry and will destroy (even more) thousands of jobs in this unprecedented crisis”.

"For the first time in over four months, Chinese carriers transported more than one million passengers on 5 June, marking a gradual recovery for the industry after being hard hit by the coronavirus outbreak. The Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) states that domestic carriers flew about 1.04 million passengers that day,  about 38% lower than the same day a year ago. The carriers flew more than 11,000 flights that day, a new single-day high for the industry since February. For the first five days of June, the CAAC notes the average number of passengers carried domestically was about 935,000, with the average number of flights per day hitting around 10,600. Average passenger load factor hovered around 70%. While these were lower figures compared to the same period last year, they were better than May's averages. For that month, CAAC data indicates its carriers ferried an average of 786,000 passengers per day, and performed close to 9,500 flights daily. In April, the average number of passengers flown each day was around 523,000, and average daily flights 6,950. Chinese carriers saw traffic figures bottom out in February, when the coronavirus outbreak, which originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan, grew in magnitude, sending cities into lockdowns, and prompting the imposition of travel restrictions. However, the country has seen some degree of recovery since then, particularly in its domestic market, as airlines mounted more flights, and travel demand picked up.",6,90,3.0,0.2793,"passenger, loss, operating, revenue, traffic, month, increase, capacity, decline, result","['month', 'chinese', 'carrier', 'transport', 'passenger', 'june', 'mark', 'gradual', 'recovery', 'industry', 'hard', 'hit', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'civil', 'administration', 'caac', 'state', 'domestic', 'carrier', 'flew', 'passenger', 'day', 'low', 'day', 'ago', 'carrier', 'flew', 'day', 'singleday', 'high', 'industry', 'since', 'february', 'day', 'june', 'caac', 'note', 'average', 'number', 'passenger', 'carry', 'domestically', 'average', 'number', 'per', 'day', 'hit', 'around', 'average', 'passenger', 'load', 'factor', 'hover', 'around', 'low', 'figure', 'compare', 'period', 'well', 'may', 'average', 'month', 'caac', 'data', 'indicates', 'carrier', 'ferry', 'average', 'passenger', 'per', 'day', 'perform', 'close', 'daily', 'april', 'average', 'number', 'passenger', 'flown', 'day', 'around', 'average', 'daily', 'chinese', 'carrier', 'saw', 'traffic', 'figure', 'bottom', 'february', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'originate', 'chinese', 'city', 'wuhan', 'grow', 'magnitude', 'send', 'city', 'lockdown', 'prompt', 'imposition', 'travel', 'restriction', 'however', 'country', 'see', 'degree', 'recovery', 'since', 'particularly', 'domestic', 'market', 'mount', 'travel', 'demand', 'picked']"
"ST Engineering's aerospace subsidiary in the USA has suffered a data breach after being hit by criminal ransomware attack. The incident at VT San Antonio Aerospace involved a cyber criminal group known as the Maze group gaining unauthorised access to its IT network and launching a ransomware attack. ST Engineering says that investigations are ongoing. It adds: “At this point, the ongoing investigation indicates that the threat has been contained and is believed to be isolated to a limited part of ST Engineering's commercial operations in the [USA].” The Straits Times, citing cybersecurity firm Cyfirma, reported that hackers extracted about 1.5 terabytes of data from the MRO, which could have been stolen as early as in March. ST Engineering adds that its IT network in Singapore, where it is headquartered, is not affected by the cyberattack, and that its other businesses are not compromised. It has also stepped up cybersecurity measures within the group, while VT San Antonio Aerospace has began notifying potentially affected customers. Vice-president of VT San Antonio Aerospace Ed Onwe adds: “As part of this process, we are conducting a rigorous review of the incident and our systems to ensure that the data we are entrusted with remains safe and secure. This includes deploying advanced tools to remediate the intrusion and to restore systems.” The San Antonio, Texas based MRO was established in 2002, and specialises in aircraft maintenance and overhaul.

"Preliminary information from the flight recorders of the crashed Pakistan International Airlines Airbus A320 in Karachi have not indicated any reason for A320 operators to take safety action. Airbus has contacted operators of the aircraft type following the 22 May accident which occurred as the PIA jet, arriving from Lahore as flight PK8303, attempted to conduct a second approach after executing a go-around. FlightGlobal understands that operators have been informed that Airbus has “no specific safety recommendations to raise at this stage of the investigation”, following an initial analysis of cockpit-voice and flight-data recordings, air traffic control records, and site information. “Both recorders provided valuable information for the investigation,” operators have been advised. While the inquiry has yet to detail the circumstances of the accident, the absence of recommendations in the Airbus communication provisionally indicates that there was nothing technically unsound about the aircraft and that its systems showed no unexpected or unusual response to crew actions. No specific flight-data recorder information has been released on the status of the landing-gear during the first approach to Karachi's runway 25L, or the dynamics of the final approach such as the descent rate. But the all-operator communication indirectly strengthens the evidence that the landing-gear of the aircraft was not malfunctioning before the jet apparently touched down on the runway on its engine pods, rather than its wheels, and climbed away. For a parked A320 with CFM International CFM56 engines there would normally be 0.57m ground clearance from the underside of the nacelles. The A320 had previously been the subject of main landing-gear deployment issues in 2013 which were traced to actuator jamming. But crew communications with Karachi air traffic control had not referenced any landing-gear problems. A320 normal pre-landing cockpit procedures include a 'landing-gear down' check which typically accompanies setting of the go-around altitude, arming of spoilers, and a check on the flap configuration. After the go-around the crew indicated to air traffic control that the aircraft was unable to hold altitude and had lost engine power. Surveillance video images of the aircraft's final descent, as it attempted a second approach, clearly show the landing-gear deployed. Just two of the 99 occupants survived the accident. Pakistan's aircraft accident investigation board is leading the probe, assisted by Airbus, Safran Aircraft Engines, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency, and French investigation authority BEA which took responsibility for downloading the flight-recorder information at its Paris facilities.

"German leisure carrier TUIfly intends to cut around 700 jobs and approximately halve its fleet in response to the coronavirus crisis, according to pilot union Vereinigung Cockpit. Describing the move as a “heavy blow for employees”, the union says TUIfly will concentrate its operations on its Hannover base, Dusseldorf, Frankfurt, Munich and Stuttgart. TUIfly has not responded to a request for comment. Under a previous plan, the Boeing 737 operator was to launch long-haul flights with 787s from Dusseldorf in November, but this has been put on hold, the union notes. Its president, Markus Wahl, states that TUIfly management should “quickly” start staff talks and conduct them “honestly and without calculation”, and that “neither employees nor the company can afford to waste time”. Cirium fleets data shows that TUIfly has 38 737-800s and a single -700. All but two of the aircraft are listed as being in storage. On 3 June, TUI Group disclosed an agreement with Boeing to delay the delivery of 61 on-order 737 Max jets by an average of two years. Under the revised schedule, fewer than half of the originally planned 737 Max jets will be delivered to TUI over the next two years. The aircraft have been ordered for multiple operators within the group. TUI has airline operations in Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Sweden and the UK, and says it will reduce the fleet across the group to address the impact of the crisis.

"Willie Walsh, the chief executive of British Airways parent IAG, has disclosed that the group is considering legal action over the UK government's mandatory two-week quarantine for travellers arriving in the country from 8 June. “It's terrible, I wrote to MPs [members of parliament] last night to say that this initiative has torpedoed our opportunity to get flying in July,” Walsh told Sky News on 5 June. “We think it's irrational, we think it's disproportionate, and we are giving consideration to a legal challenge to this legislation so we are reviewing that with the lawyers later on today.” He added: “I suspect there are other airlines who are doing so because it's important to point out there was no consultation with the industry prior to enacting this legislation and we do believe it's an irrational piece of legislation.” Ryanair is backing the move to bring the quarantine before the courts, telling Cirium that it would “support any legal action launched by IAG against the UK's ineffective and useless visitor quarantine”. The Irish carrier's chief executive Michael O'Leary has criticised the UK government's plans, arguing that they make little sense and have been badly prepared. “You don't have a quarantine,” he told the BBC on 4 June. “People are going to be allowed to come in through Heathrow and Gatwick, they then get on the London underground, the trains, taxis to get to their destination, they can go to the supermarket...There is no quarantine.” Relations between the airline industry and the UK government have soured over the quarantine plan. IAG reportedly refused to attend a 4 June meeting with UK home secretary Priti Patel to discuss the plan, although the group has declined to comment.

"Boeing is developing a modification for passenger and freighter 777s after the discovery of a fuel discrepancy problem involving the centre wing tank. The modification follows at least 25 instances of disparity between the aircraft's fuel-quantity indicator for the centre tank and the uplifted amount from refuelling trucks – after which the crew received a 'fuel disagree' or 'insufficient fuel' message within 3h of departure. At least 16 of these occurrences led the crew to continue the flight, after which six aircraft arrived at their destination while 10 had to land at a diversion airport. Boeing 777s have a centre wing tank of 98,700 litres (26,100USgal) plus a left and right wing tank each with capacity of 35,200 litres. The issue affects only the centre tank. Investigation of the insufficient fuel situation has traced the issue to a “design flaw” in the fuel-quantity indicating system, says a US FAA directive. This flaw results in improper fuel-density calculation and leads the indicator to show a different fuel quantity to that actually present in the centre wing tank. “In almost all of the events, the [indicator] showed more fuel than the actual fuel quantity in the [tank], resulting in less fuel on the [aircraft] than the required fuel load for the mission,” says the directive. But it states that the discrepancy can also work the other way, with the indicator suggesting less fuel than the total uplifted, and the aircraft carrying more than necessary. The problem is complicated by difficulties in comparing the fuel uplifted from the truck, or hydrant, with the quantity on board the aircraft. This is because the fuelling system uses the aircraft's indicator to stop the fuelling process when the requested uplift has been carried out. Paying for fuel requires a volume measurement, which involves calculations that consider the fuel mass and take into account remaining fuel in the tank from the previous flight. These calculations are not easy, says the FAA, and are “prone to significant inaccuracies”. While fuelling procedures require checks to verify the correct fuel has been uplifted to the aircraft, it adds, there is evidence that such verification is sometimes “not accomplished or done incorrectly”. If the aircraft subsequently departs with insufficient fuel, its fuel-management system will typically advise of quantity anomalies within the first 3h of flight – requiring the crew to carry out leak checks, or consider either turning back or diverting. Opting to proceed with the flight, the FAA points out, presents the potential risk of fuel exhaustion before the aircraft is able to land at its destination or reach its diversion airport. While Boeing has been developing a modification for 777s, the FAA says there is an “urgency” to the situation which requires interim safety measures. It is ordering a repetitive check on the centre wing tank fuel-quantity indication through a new procedure, called refuelling station door cycling, to be carried out after any centre tank fuelling. This procedure involves accessing the refuelling station door on the left wing, closing it for a few seconds, then re-opening the door and waiting for the fuel-quantity display to reset. If the fuel-tanks quantities are incorrect – outside of loadsheet requirements – then the fuel load must be adjusted, and the cycling procedure repeated. The directive also requires the aircraft flight manual to be revised to include flight crew acknowledgement that they have received notification of the door cycling procedure having been carried out. Once the Boeing modification for the 777's fuel-quantity indicating system is developed, approved, and available, the FAA says it might consider issuing additional directives.",6,95,6.0,0.5914,"engine, maintenance, fuel, takeoff, result, failure, system, problem, power, issue","['develop', 'modification', 'passenger', 'freighter', 'discovery', 'fuel', 'discrepancy', 'problem', 'involve', 'centre', 'wing', 'tank', 'modification', 'follow', 'least', 'instance', 'disparity', 'fuelquantity', 'indicator', 'centre', 'tank', 'uplifted', 'amount', 'refuel', 'truck', 'crew', 'receive', 'disagree', 'fuel', 'message', 'within', 'departure', 'least', 'occurrence', 'lead', 'crew', 'continue', 'arrive', 'destination', 'land', 'diversion', 'airport', 'centre', 'wing', 'tank', 'litre', 'plus', 'left', 'right', 'wing', 'tank', 'capacity', 'litre', 'issue', 'affect', 'centre', 'tank', 'investigation', 'insufficient', 'fuel', 'situation', 'trace', 'issue', 'design', 'flaw', 'fuelquantity', 'indicate', 'system', 'say', 'u', 'faa', 'directive', 'flaw', 'result', 'improper', 'fueldensity', 'calculation', 'lead', 'indicator', 'different', 'fuel', 'quantity', 'actually', 'present', 'centre', 'wing', 'tank', 'almost', 'event', 'indicator', 'fuel', 'actual', 'fuel', 'quantity', 'tank', 'result', 'less', 'fuel', 'require', 'fuel', 'load', 'mission', 'say', 'directive', 'state', 'discrepancy', 'work', 'way', 'indicator', 'suggest', 'less', 'fuel', 'total', 'uplifted', 'carry', 'necessary', 'problem', 'complicate', 'difficulty', 'compare', 'fuel', 'uplifted', 'truck', 'hydrant', 'quantity', 'board', 'fuel', 'system', 'indicator', 'stop', 'fuel', 'process', 'request', 'uplift', 'carry', 'pay', 'fuel', 'require', 'volume', 'measurement', 'involves', 'calculation', 'consider', 'fuel', 'mass', 'take', 'account', 'remain', 'fuel', 'tank', 'previous', 'calculation', 'easy', 'say', 'faa', 'prone', 'significant', 'inaccuracy', 'fuel', 'procedure', 'require', 'check', 'verify', 'correct', 'fuel', 'uplifted', 'add', 'evidence', 'verification', 'sometimes', 'accomplish', 'incorrectly', 'subsequently', 'departs', 'insufficient', 'fuel', 'fuelmanagement', 'system', 'typically', 'advise', 'quantity', 'anomaly', 'within', 'require', 'crew', 'carry', 'leak', 'check', 'consider', 'either', 'turn', 'back', 'divert', 'opt', 'proceed', 'faa', 'point', 'present', 'potential', 'risk', 'fuel', 'exhaustion', 'able', 'land', 'destination', 'reach', 'diversion', 'airport', 'develop', 'modification', 'faa', 'say', 'urgency', 'situation', 'require', 'interim', 'safety', 'measure', 'order', 'repetitive', 'check', 'centre', 'wing', 'tank', 'fuelquantity', 'indication', 'procedure', 'call', 'refuel', 'station', 'door', 'cycling', 'carry', 'centre', 'tank', 'fuel', 'procedure', 'involves', 'access', 'refuel', 'station', 'door', 'left', 'wing', 'closing', 'second', 'reopen', 'door', 'wait', 'fuelquantity', 'display', 'reset', 'fueltanks', 'quantity', 'incorrect', 'outside', 'loadsheet', 'requirement', 'fuel', 'load', 'must', 'adjust', 'cycling', 'procedure', 'repeat', 'directive', 'require', 'manual', 'revise', 'include', 'crew', 'acknowledgement', 'receive', 'notification', 'door', 'cycling', 'procedure', 'carry', 'modification', 'fuelquantity', 'indicate', 'system', 'developed', 'approve', 'available', 'faa', 'say', 'might', 'consider', 'issue', 'additional', 'directive']"
"Croatia Airlines has held preliminary talks with Slovenian government and airport officials over potentially beginning flights from Ljubljana. The Slovenian airport has been without a home carrier since the collapse of Adria Airways last year. Cirium schedules data shows that prior to the coronavirus shutdown, no single carrier had a dominant presence - Aeroflot, EasyJet and Turkish Airlines were the largest operators with each representing around a fifth of ASK capacity from the airport. A spokesperson for Croatia Airlines says it is potentially interested in establishing flights from Ljubljana, the prime hub of neighbouring Slovenia. ”In that context, an initial meeting was held with representatives of the Slovenian Ministry of Infrastructure and Ljubljana Airport, but so far nothing specifically has been agreed,” the spokesperson says. Croatia Airlines has been gradually restoring its flight network since May, initially on domestic routes. From 7 June it will expand service to five destinations from Zagreb, serving Amsterdam, Copenhagen and Frankfurt as well as the domestic links to Dubrovnik and Split. A week later the carrier will add Zurich to its international links and from 15 June it plans to restore flights to Brussels, Dublin, London, Munich, Rome, Sarajevo and Vienna.

"Bell has struck agreements with nine aerospace firms to supply parts, software and services for its 360 Invictus helicopter, the company's prototype submission for the US Army Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft (FARA) programme. Bell and its team have to move quickly to build the first prototype, as the US Army expects to see examples of FARA flying by the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022. The other aerospace manufacturer in the competition, Sikorsky, has yet to announce suppliers for its Raider X helicopter prototype submission. Both companies were selected in March 2020 by the US Army to build competing aircraft.  Astronics Corporation: will provide a modular framework for airframe power generation, conversion, and distribution. Collins Aerospace: will integrate avionics hardware and software, as well as mission systems. GE Aviation:will provide the T901 turboshaft engine, a 3,000hp (2,240kW) powerplant that the US Army has chosen as the future turbine for the aircraft that wins the FARA competition. The company is also integrating the aircraft's Health Awareness System. ITT-Enidine:will provide passive liquid inertia vibration eliminator units for all modes of helicopter operation, including high-speed flight. L3Harris Technologies: will provide the Wescam MX-15D, a stabilised multi-sensor, multi-spectral imaging and targeting camera to be placed on the nose of the helicopter. Parker Lord:will provide rotor dampers, the main rotor CF bearing, the tail rotor tension torsion strap and the active vibration control system. Mecaer Aviation Group: will provide for a tail dragger landing gear system that is fully retractable to enable better aerodynamics. Moog:will provide flight control computer electronics, software and flight control actuation, as well as critical components of Bell's fly-by-wire flight control system. TRU Simulation + Training:will provide a high-fidelity flight simulator. Bell's 360 Invictus is a conventional helicopter with a short wing to provide lift and an auxiliary power unit to help meet the US Army's minimum cruise speed of at least 180kt (333km/h). The US Army wants FARA to replace its Bell OH-58 Kiowa Warrior helicopter, retired in 2017, as its scouting and light attack rotorcraft.

"Lufthansa Group chief executive Carsten Spohr is not ruling out a possible future part-sale of the airline's MRO arm, but stresses that the group intends to remain the majority shareholder as the technical division is “close to our heart”. Speaking during a first-quarter results briefing on 3 June, Spohr confirmed that an initial public offering for shares in Lufthansa Technik had been discussed as an option prior to the coronavirus crisis. Noting existing co-operation arrangements with manufacturers and other airlines, Spohr says an alternative option could be to merge parts of LHT with another party. LHT has separate, jointly owned engine overhaul shops with GE Aviation, MTU and Rolls-Royce. Additionally, the German MRO provider has established close partnerships with multiple OEMs for certain products and services. A shareholding in Air China's maintenance centre Ameco was among Lufthansa's early MRO investments, prior LHT's establishment in 1995. Spohr says: “Can I imagine to bring part of [LHT] to the stock exchange or merge some of it with a partner? Yes.” But he rules out the possibility of divesting LHT's entire shareholding. ”Lufthansa Technik is part of our core...It's close to our heart. We will not give that up easily at all.” He says the coronavirus crisis has put any ownership-change evaluations on hold as “the market at this point of time is the wrong one to do any divestment”. However, the possibility of part-divestment could return to the table if conditions improve and divestment opportunities arise, Spohr indicates. “It's good to have that value [LHT] in the company. And the options we had before corona might be the options we have after corona.” LHT's adjusted EBIT declined to €4 million ($4.5 million) during the first quarter, from €123 million in the same period of 2019.Lufthansa says that lost income from hour-based service agreements with third-party airline customers that are flying less or not all because of the pandemic is “increasingly having an impact on Lufthansa Technik”. As part of restructuring measures, LHT's line-maintenance business has been transferred to Lufthansa Group. “[Line maintenance] is now part of the network airlines business segment,” it says. Last year, Lufthansa agreed to sale of its European catering business LSG to GateGroup. That deal was cleared by the European Commission in April, but hasn't been closed yet as it hinges on the sale of certain GateGroup divisions, Lufthansa notes in its quarterly report. Lufthansa also intends to divest its international catering operations. But the sale effort has been put on hold because of the pandemic. The group intends to divest non-core activities as part of strategy to improve its cash position and repay loans provided by the governments of Germany and Switzerland in the wake of the coronavirus crisis.

"Parliamentarians have urged the UK aviation minister to explore whether pressure can be put on British Airways' lucrative slots at London Heathrow to deter the carrier from measures to shed thousands of jobs. Under-secretary of state for transport Kelly Tolhurst, who has responsibility for aviation, was even asked if the government could examine whether BA could be brought back under public ownership. But Tolhurst stressed, during the 3 June debate about coronavirus and the impact on aviation, that BA's actions amount to a “commercial decision”. Several members of parliament expressed concern that BA and other carriers were taking advantage of government financial support to preserve employment while simultaneously arranging to cut jobs. “These are commercial decisions that I regret,” said Tolhurst, “particularly from companies that benefit from the job retention scheme, which was not designed for taxpayers to fund the wages of employees only for those companies to put the same staff on notice of redundancy during the furlough period.” Opposition Labour party member Zarah Sultana was among those asking whether the government was prepared to withdraw BA's airport slots in response. But she also queried whether the minister would commit to “exploring the option to bring the company back under public control”. Tolhurst did not respond specifically to the ownership question, or even clarify whether the government could realistically pursue such a course, simply stating that it would “look at all the options we, as a government, have to make use of”.  Under-secretary of state for transport Kelly Tolhurst spoke during the 3 June debate Conservative party member Huw Merriman asked whether the government would ask the Civil Aviation Authority to “undertake an urgent review” of slot allocation at Heathrow, and examine whether slots can be transferred from “downsizing” companies and handed to airlines that want to expand. But while Tolhurst said Merriman was “right” to raise the slots query, she pointed out: “The government are currently legally prevented from intervening in the slots allocation process.” She stated that the government wants slots to be “used as effectively as possible” and to ensure that the slot-allocation process “encourages competition and provides connectivity”. “That is something I will be looking at,” she said. BA disclosed in April that it was considering a restructuring programme which could result in 12,000 redundancies. But the Unite union has accused BA of trying to “fire and rehire” its workforce on different terms, and has demanded a government review of the airline's slots.

"The Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) will allow more foreign carriers to fly into Mainland China, as it rolls out incentives for airlines based on passengers not testing positive for the coronavirus. From 8 June, foreign airlines which were previously not allowed to operate to China will now be able to do so, but can only operate one flight a week to a Chinese city of their choosing. While the CAAC did not explicitly state which carriers will be able to benefit from the new easing of restrictions, it is understood that the move will benefit US carriers, which have so far not been able to operate flights to China. In May, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines applied to the CAAC for authority to resume numerous passenger flights between the countries, after suspending their routes due to the coronavirus outbreak. However, the CAAC denied their requests. China restricted the number of international flights into the country in March, in a bid to stem the number of imported coronavirus cases. Its order in March also also prohibited carriers from adding more capacity than they had in schedules on 12 March – a date on which US airlines had no China flights. The CAAC's latest move comes a day after the USA barred all Chinese passenger carriers from flying into its airports, citing travel restrictions imposed by Beijing on US carriers. Separately, the CAAC has rolled out an incentive scheme for foreign carriers – airlines will be allowed to increase the number of flights per week to two, if there are no incoming passengers testing positive for the coronavirus for three consecutive weeks. If an airline was found to have carried up to five passengers who test positive, they will have to suspend their operations into China for a week, before being allowed to restart flights. If there are 10 passengers, that carrier will suspend operations for a month.",6,101,5.0,0.3136,"carrier, march, international, outbreak, suspend, capacity, schedule, april, united, coronavirus","['civil', 'administration', 'caac', 'allow', 'foreign', 'carrier', 'fly', 'mainland', 'roll', 'incentive', 'base', 'passenger', 'test', 'positive', 'coronavirus', 'june', 'foreign', 'previously', 'allow', 'operate', 'able', 'operate', 'week', 'chinese', 'city', 'choose', 'caac', 'explicitly', 'state', 'carrier', 'able', 'benefit', 'ease', 'restriction', 'understood', 'move', 'benefit', 'u', 'carrier', 'far', 'able', 'operate', 'may', 'delta', 'line', 'united', 'apply', 'caac', 'authority', 'resume', 'numerous', 'passenger', 'country', 'suspend', 'route', 'due', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'however', 'caac', 'deny', 'request', 'restrict', 'number', 'international', 'country', 'march', 'bid', 'stem', 'number', 'import', 'coronavirus', 'case', 'order', 'march', 'prohibit', 'carrier', 'add', 'capacity', 'schedule', 'march', 'date', 'u', 'caac', 'late', 'move', 'come', 'day', 'usa', 'bar', 'chinese', 'passenger', 'carrier', 'fly', 'airport', 'cite', 'travel', 'restriction', 'impose', 'beijing', 'u', 'carrier', 'separately', 'caac', 'roll', 'incentive', 'scheme', 'foreign', 'carrier', 'allow', 'increase', 'number', 'per', 'week', 'incoming', 'passenger', 'test', 'positive', 'coronavirus', 'consecutive', 'week', 'found', 'carry', 'passenger', 'test', 'positive', 'suspend', 'operation', 'week', 'allow', 'restart', 'passenger', 'carrier', 'suspend', 'operation', 'month']"
"A US federal judge has sided with Boeing in a dispute with the UK division of cargo airline Volga-Dnepr, striking down the airline's request that Boeing be barred from selling four cargo jets to other customers. Judge Ricardo Martinez of US District Court for the Western District of Washington ruled that Volga-Dnepr UK's breach of sales contracts left Boeing open to resell the aircraft. “Boeing...was under no contractual obligation to continue performing” its obligations under its contracts with Volga-Dnepr, the judge's 2 June order says. “Customer remains in breach of both purchase agreements.” The case involves one 747-8 Freighter (registration VQ-BIO) and three 777F that Volga-Dnepr had ordered in recent years and that were scheduled for delivery in 2020.  Volga-Dnepr company AirBridgeCargo now operates this 747-8F (registration VP-BIN), seen at the 2018 Farnborough air show in the colours of its previous operator, CargoLogicAir, also a Volga-Dnepr affiliate. Boeing was to deliver the 747-8F to Volga-Dnepr on 29 February, and deliver the 777Fs in the first half of 2020, according to court papers. But as coronavirus struck, Volga Dnepr notified Boeing it was unable to take the aircraft due to financial difficulties, citing “force majeure factors”, the papers show. The carrier said coronavirus “decimated” its business, and the airline did not show for the 29 February 747-8F delivery. Boeing responded by saying it would attempt to resell the four aircraft, filings show. But in a twist, Volga-Dnepr's financial situation improved. As the year progressed, “demand for air freight soared” and the carrier secured financing needed to acquire the 747-8F. In April and May, Volga-Dnepr wrote Boeing, retracting its previous notices, confirming “readiness to accept delivery of the Boeing 747-8F” and expressing its intention to take the three 777Fs. But Boeing had already resold the aircraft; one other customer signed an agreement to purchase the 747-8 and another customer agree to buy the 777Fs, papers show. In response, on 27 May Volga-Dnepr asked the court to ban Boeing from selling the aircraft to other customers, arguing it had retracted the previous notices – those saying it did not intend to take the aircraft. Judge Martinez has now denied that request. Volga-Dnepr UK's attorney declined to comment about the case to FlightGlobal, deferring comment to the airline. The carrier could not immediately be reached by FlightGlobal. Volga-Dnepr Group of Companies owns AirBridgeCargo, which operates its 747-8Fs, Cirium fleets data shows. Boeing declines to comment “on pending litigation” but says “Volga-Dnepr is a valued customer with 27 Boeing airplanes in their fleet”. “We work very closely with all of our customers to fully understand their requirements and develop flexible solutions to support them,” Boeing says.",6,102,0.0,0.2769,"order, business, jet, delivery, production, customer, deliver, commercial, quarter, include","['u', 'federal', 'judge', 'side', 'dispute', 'uk', 'division', 'cargo', 'volgadnepr', 'strike', 'request', 'bar', 'sell', 'cargo', 'jet', 'customer', 'judge', 'ricardo', 'martinez', 'u', 'district', 'court', 'western', 'district', 'washington', 'rule', 'volgadnepr', 'uk', 'breach', 'sale', 'contract', 'left', 'open', 'resell', 'contractual', 'obligation', 'continue', 'perform', 'obligation', 'contract', 'volgadnepr', 'judge', 'june', 'order', 'say', 'customer', 'remains', 'breach', 'purchase', 'case', 'involves', 'freighter', 'registration', 'vqbio', 'volgadnepr', 'order', 'recent', 'schedule', 'delivery', 'volgadnepr', 'airbridgecargo', 'operates', 'registration', 'vpbin', 'see', 'farnborough', 'colour', 'previous', 'operator', 'cargologicair', 'volgadnepr', 'affiliate', 'deliver', 'volgadnepr', 'february', 'deliver', 'half', 'accord', 'court', 'paper', 'coronavirus', 'struck', 'volga', 'dnepr', 'notify', 'unable', 'take', 'due', 'financial', 'difficulty', 'cite', 'force', 'majeure', 'factor', 'paper', 'carrier', 'say', 'coronavirus', 'decimate', 'business', 'february', 'delivery', 'respond', 'say', 'attempt', 'resell', 'filing', 'twist', 'volgadnepr', 'financial', 'situation', 'improve', 'progress', 'demand', 'freight', 'soar', 'carrier', 'secure', 'financing', 'need', 'acquire', 'april', 'may', 'volgadnepr', 'write', 'retract', 'previous', 'notice', 'confirm', 'readiness', 'accept', 'delivery', 'express', 'intention', 'take', 'already', 'resold', 'customer', 'sign', 'agreement', 'purchase', 'another', 'customer', 'agree', 'buy', 'paper', 'response', 'may', 'volgadnepr', 'ask', 'court', 'ban', 'sell', 'customer', 'argue', 'retract', 'previous', 'notice', 'say', 'intend', 'take', 'judge', 'martinez', 'deny', 'request', 'volgadnepr', 'uk', 'attorney', 'decline', 'comment', 'case', 'flightglobal', 'defer', 'comment', 'carrier', 'immediately', 'reach', 'flightglobal', 'volgadnepr', 'airbridgecargo', 'operates', 'fleet', 'data', 'decline', 'comment', 'pending', 'litigation', 'say', 'volgadnepr', 'value', 'customer', 'airplane', 'fleet', 'work', 'closely', 'customer', 'fully', 'understand', 'requirement', 'develop', 'flexible', 'solution', 'support', 'say']"
"The operator of Berlin's Tegel International airport, the primary airfield for commercial passenger service to the German capital, has decided to keep the Cold War-era facility open until November as travel restrictions ease following the global coronavirus pandemic. Flughafen Berlin-Brandenburg (FBB) now says that the airport, where it had previously decided to suspend operations in June, will remain in use past the opening of the newly erected Berlin-Brandenburg International airport (BER). Berlin-Brandenburg was built to replace Tegel. Last month, FBB's shareholders had unanimously agreed to a temporary exemption from obligations to operate the old airport in the northwest of the city, allowing it to effectively shutter on 15 June. That would have left the German capital without a major airfield for almost four months. Flights would have been operated in and out of Berlin-Schoenefeld, in the southeast, a much smaller facility than Tegel. Schoenefeld is also the site of BER, which is yet to open. But on 3 June, FBB backtracked on its plan to close Tegel earlier, as demand for flights to Berlin begins to rise following the easing of lockdowns imposed by many European countries to stop the spread of the coronavirus. FBB has now decided Tegel will keep operating until 8 November, just over a week after BER is due to open. The German government has said it will lift travel warnings for 29 European countries on 15 June, driving demand for the flights during the summer holiday travel season. “In the last few days there has been more information about the recovery of aviation,” FBB chief executive Engelbert Luetke Daldrup said on 3 June. “Air traffic will continuously rise over the summer. At the end of July we will probably have so many regular flights that we will need both airports to process them under current [coronavirus] conditions.” Daldrup says the two Berlin airports could see as many as 100 flights per day by July, and process about 20,000 passengers. That is up from the current 3,000 passengers per day but far lower than the 100,000 passengers prior to the pandemic. The new Berlin-Brandenburg airport has had a troubled history, with its official opening delayed for eight years. Construction and design problems as well as numerous management changes slowed completion. It is now scheduled to open on 31 October.",6,103,4.0,0.3743,"airport, fleet, service, data, carrier, operation, passenger, number, operate, operator","['operator', 'berlin', 'tegel', 'international', 'airport', 'primary', 'airfield', 'commercial', 'passenger', 'service', 'german', 'capital', 'decide', 'keep', 'cold', 'warera', 'facility', 'open', 'november', 'travel', 'restriction', 'ease', 'follow', 'global', 'coronavirus', 'pandemic', 'flughafen', 'berlinbrandenburg', 'fbb', 'say', 'airport', 'previously', 'decide', 'suspend', 'operation', 'june', 'remain', 'use', 'past', 'opening', 'newly', 'erect', 'berlinbrandenburg', 'international', 'airport', 'ber', 'berlinbrandenburg', 'built', 'replace', 'tegel', 'month', 'fbb', 'shareholder', 'unanimously', 'agree', 'temporary', 'exemption', 'obligation', 'operate', 'old', 'airport', 'northwest', 'city', 'allow', 'effectively', 'shutter', 'june', 'left', 'german', 'capital', 'without', 'major', 'airfield', 'almost', 'month', 'operate', 'berlinschoenefeld', 'southeast', 'much', 'small', 'facility', 'tegel', 'schoenefeld', 'site', 'ber', 'yet', 'open', 'june', 'fbb', 'backtrack', 'plan', 'close', 'tegel', 'earlier', 'demand', 'berlin', 'begin', 'rise', 'follow', 'ease', 'lockdown', 'impose', 'many', 'european', 'country', 'stop', 'spread', 'coronavirus', 'fbb', 'decide', 'tegel', 'keep', 'operating', 'november', 'week', 'ber', 'due', 'open', 'german', 'government', 'say', 'lift', 'travel', 'warning', 'european', 'country', 'june', 'drive', 'demand', 'summer', 'holiday', 'travel', 'season', 'day', 'information', 'recovery', 'fbb', 'chief', 'executive', 'engelbert', 'luetke', 'daldrup', 'say', 'june', 'traffic', 'continuously', 'rise', 'summer', 'end', 'july', 'probably', 'many', 'regular', 'need', 'airport', 'process', 'current', 'coronavirus', 'daldrup', 'say', 'berlin', 'airport', 'see', 'many', 'per', 'day', 'july', 'process', 'passenger', 'current', 'passenger', 'per', 'day', 'far', 'low', 'passenger', 'prior', 'pandemic', 'berlinbrandenburg', 'airport', 'troubled', 'history', 'official', 'opening', 'delayed', 'construction', 'design', 'problem', 'well', 'numerous', 'management', 'change', 'slow', 'completion', 'schedule', 'open', 'october']"
"The chairman of the US Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation has introduced a bill aimed at increasing aircraft safety in the wake of two fatal Boeing 737 Max crashes, while the House is drafting a bill expected to seek more aggressive safety regulations. Republican Senator Roger Wicker introduced the “Aircraft Safety Improvement Act of 2020” based on investigation into the certification process of 737 Max aircraft that his committee began in March 2019. The legislation aims to require the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to eliminate instances of undue pressure or “regulatory coziness” that could lead to lapses in safety protocols. The committee will have further questions about aviation safety and the ongoing process to recertify 737 Max aircraft for FAA administrator Steve Dickson when he testifies on 17 June.  Boeing 737 Max on the ground in 2019 during the regulatory grounding. A key part of the bill would address the FAA's Organization Designation Authorisation (ODA) certification process because it potentially allowed Boeing to avoid longer, more thorough safety oversight for Max aircraft. The bill would require the FAA to develop best practices for the ODA process, which allows the agency to delegate data reports during safety certification to individuals or organisations that represent them before the agency grants final certification approval. Lawmakers and safety advocates have criticised the ODA process for its potential conflict of interest because the jobs of such ODA delegates and engineer whistleblowers are at risk if they report problems during an airframer's certification process. The bill states “at a minimum, the best practices shall address preventing and deterring instances of undue pressure” in case a company attempts to hasten a safety review. The bill would also require the FAA to coordinate with airframers to develop a Safety Management System, similar to those used by airlines, which determine whether an aircraft is safe to fly after delivery by a manufacturer. This step would include “a documented surveillance process by defining and planning inspections, audits and monitoring activities on a continuous basis” to ensure potential safety risks are addressed, according to the bill. During flight testing “a representative sample of international and domestic airline pilots” would also be required to provide input about new aircraft. While lawmakers have determined that Boeing did not share enough information about the automated flight controls created for 737 Max aircraft that contributed to the deaths of 346 victims, investigations showed that the responses of pilots to the automated controls also contributed to the two fatal crashes. To prevent similar mistakes in the future, Wicker's bill would “require FAA to conduct more research into human factors with respect to the design and certification of aircraft”. The Democratic-led House transportation committee is drafting its own bill that will reflect findings from its ongoing investigation into the design, development and certification of Max aircraft, a committee aide tells FlightGlobal partner Cirium. The committee's Democratic leaders – Reps. Rick Larsen and Peter DeFazio – have discussed a more-thorough approach to the certification process, despite concerns voiced by airline industry groups that claim undue influence and safety gaps are very rare. “Despite the wishes of industry, it would be the height of irresponsibility to leave the ODA system as is and just hope for the best the next time,” DeFazio has said. “Not addressing the failures head-on would be a grave mistake and that will not happen on my watch.” There could be stricter regulation of the FAA if Democrats win the Senate during November elections, but the costs of new rules would likely fall on Boeing and other airframers rather than airlines who buy the aircraft, Teal Group aerospace analyst Richard Aboulafia tells Cirium. “Max sales contracts would transfer the costs of additional pilot training back to Boeing,” Aboulafia says. “From an airline standpoint, I don't think it will change much.” The slump in air travel demand related to coronavirus will likely also postpone the need for additional spending on pilot training or mandated aircraft conversion to meet new safety rules, he adds. Many airlines reduced capacity by 90% or more in response to the crisis, Cirium fleets data shows, but after 16 April global airline capacity began steadily to increase from a low of 12,500 aircraft in service worldwide to 15,125 on 2 June. With that slow pace of recovery there will likely be a surplus of both aircraft and pilots “for a long time”, Aboulafia says.",6,104,11.0,0.5327,"pilot, faa, issue, safety, include, report, require, training, ground, order","['chairman', 'u', 'senate', 'committee', 'commerce', 'science', 'transportation', 'introduce', 'bill', 'aim', 'increase', 'safety', 'wake', 'fatal', 'crash', 'house', 'draft', 'bill', 'expect', 'seek', 'aggressive', 'safety', 'regulation', 'republican', 'senator', 'roger', 'wicker', 'introduce', 'safety', 'improvement', 'act', 'base', 'investigation', 'certification', 'process', 'committee', 'begin', 'march', 'legislation', 'aim', 'require', 'u', 'federal', 'administration', 'faa', 'eliminate', 'instance', 'undue', 'pressure', 'regulatory', 'coziness', 'lead', 'lapse', 'safety', 'protocol', 'committee', 'far', 'question', 'safety', 'ongoing', 'process', 'recertify', 'faa', 'administrator', 'steve', 'dickson', 'testifies', 'june', 'ground', 'regulatory', 'ground', 'key', 'part', 'bill', 'address', 'faa', 'organization', 'designation', 'authorisation', 'oda', 'certification', 'process', 'potentially', 'allow', 'avoid', 'longer', 'thorough', 'safety', 'oversight', 'bill', 'require', 'faa', 'develop', 'best', 'practice', 'oda', 'process', 'allows', 'agency', 'delegate', 'data', 'report', 'safety', 'certification', 'individual', 'organisation', 'represent', 'agency', 'grant', 'final', 'certification', 'approval', 'lawmaker', 'safety', 'advocate', 'criticise', 'oda', 'process', 'potential', 'conflict', 'interest', 'job', 'oda', 'delegate', 'engineer', 'whistleblower', 'risk', 'report', 'problem', 'airframer', 'certification', 'process', 'bill', 'state', 'minimum', 'best', 'practice', 'shall', 'address', 'prevent', 'deter', 'instance', 'undue', 'pressure', 'case', 'attempt', 'hasten', 'safety', 'review', 'bill', 'require', 'faa', 'coordinate', 'airframers', 'develop', 'safety', 'management', 'system', 'similar', 'use', 'determine', 'whether', 'safe', 'fly', 'delivery', 'manufacturer', 'step', 'include', 'document', 'surveillance', 'process', 'define', 'planning', 'inspection', 'audit', 'monitoring', 'activity', 'continuous', 'basis', 'ensure', 'potential', 'safety', 'risk', 'address', 'accord', 'bill', 'test', 'representative', 'sample', 'international', 'domestic', 'pilot', 'require', 'provide', 'input', 'lawmaker', 'determine', 'share', 'enough', 'information', 'automate', 'control', 'create', 'contribute', 'death', 'victim', 'investigation', 'response', 'pilot', 'automate', 'control', 'contribute', 'fatal', 'crash', 'prevent', 'similar', 'mistake', 'future', 'wicker', 'bill', 'require', 'faa', 'conduct', 'research', 'human', 'factor', 'respect', 'design', 'certification', 'democraticled', 'house', 'transportation', 'committee', 'draft', 'bill', 'reflect', 'finding', 'ongoing', 'investigation', 'design', 'development', 'certification', 'committee', 'aide', 'tell', 'flightglobal', 'partner', 'committee', 'democratic', 'leader', 'rick', 'larsen', 'peter', 'defazio', 'discuss', 'morethorough', 'approach', 'certification', 'process', 'despite', 'concern', 'voiced', 'industry', 'claim', 'undue', 'influence', 'safety', 'gap', 'rare', 'despite', 'wish', 'industry', 'height', 'irresponsibility', 'leave', 'oda', 'system', 'hope', 'best', 'next', 'defazio', 'say', 'address', 'failure', 'headon', 'grave', 'mistake', 'happen', 'stricter', 'regulation', 'faa', 'democrat', 'win', 'senate', 'november', 'election', 'cost', 'rule', 'likely', 'fall', 'airframers', 'rather', 'buy', 'teal', 'analyst', 'richard', 'aboulafia', 'tell', 'sale', 'contract', 'transfer', 'cost', 'additional', 'pilot', 'training', 'back', 'aboulafia', 'say', 'standpoint', 'think', 'change', 'slump', 'travel', 'demand', 'related', 'coronavirus', 'likely', 'postpone', 'need', 'additional', 'spending', 'pilot', 'training', 'mandate', 'conversion', 'meet', 'safety', 'rule', 'add', 'many', 'reduce', 'capacity', 'response', 'crisis', 'fleet', 'data', 'april', 'global', 'capacity', 'begin', 'steadily', 'increase', 'low', 'service', 'worldwide', 'june', 'slow', 'pace', 'recovery', 'likely', 'surplus', 'pilot', 'long', 'aboulafia', 'say']"
"All Armenian carriers have been blacklisted by the European Commission, after more than six months of discussions with the Civil Aviation Committee of Armenia over safety concerns relating to its oversight capability. Two Armenian airlines – Aircompany Armenia and Armenia Airways – as well as the Civil Aviation Committee were visited in February by a European air safety delegation, following notification of the concerns the previous October. The on-site visit resulted in multiple findings with particular unease over staff training and serious deficiencies in effective capacity to conduct certification and oversight properly. “It is clear from the assessment visit report that the [committee] has a systemic weakness in terms of personnel management,” says documentation accompanying the blacklisting decision. The visit revealed the committee lacked procedures to determine manpower requirements and training requirements, as well as their implementation. It also lacked a structured document-management system to assure certification traceability as well as quality-management functions needed to oversee administration and effective transposition of legal, regulatory and technical requirements. “[The committee] was unable to provide requested evidence of activities performed as part of the initial air operator certificate [process] for its certified air carriers,” the blacklist documentation states. Examination of the carriers during the visit turned up “several issues”, it adds, which “should have been detected” as part of regulatory oversight. Six operators and the Civil Aviation Committee were invited to a formal European safety hearing on 12 May. These operators included Aircompany Armenia, Atlantis Armenian Airlines, Atlantis European Airways, Armenia Airways, Armenian Helicopters, and hot-air balloon firm Skyball. During the hearing the Armenian committee outlined the safety improvements made since the visit, particularly regarding personnel and document management, improvements to the flight operations department, air operator certification, and inspector training. The regulatory also informed that it had taken steps to revoke certification from Armenian carriers considered non-compliant with international safety standards. While the European safety team acknowledged that the situation in Armenia has resulted from a “long period of inefficiency and neglect”, and that rectification measures are being pursued with government support, they added that the Civil Aviation Committee's capability to oversee aviation activities is “insufficient” and does not meet minimum standards. “Significant further improvement of [the committee's] capabilities will be necessary in order to address the current safety deficiencies,” the blacklist documentation adds, citing the deficiencies with personnel management and training, as well as “inadequate” certification processes and “ineffective” oversight. While the six aviation operators provided evidence to the hearing, they failed to convince the European safety team that they were capable of independent self-regulation. “None of the information or evidence provided by any of the air carriers, before or during the hearing, provided...the assurance that the lack of safety oversight by [the Civil Aviation Committee] could be mitigated through the air carriers' own compliance and safety systems,” the documentation says. European transport commissioner Adina Valean says the decision to impose a blanket blacklisting on Armenia was unanimous, but that the Commission and the European Union Aviation Safety Agency are “ready to co-operate and invest in Armenia to improve its aviation safety”.",6,105,11.0,0.4727,"pilot, faa, issue, safety, include, report, require, training, ground, order","['armenian', 'carrier', 'blacklist', 'european', 'commission', 'month', 'discussion', 'civil', 'committee', 'armenia', 'safety', 'concern', 'relate', 'oversight', 'capability', 'armenian', 'aircompany', 'armenia', 'armenia', 'airway', 'well', 'civil', 'committee', 'visit', 'february', 'european', 'safety', 'delegation', 'follow', 'notification', 'concern', 'previous', 'october', 'onsite', 'visit', 'result', 'multiple', 'finding', 'particular', 'unease', 'staff', 'training', 'serious', 'deficiency', 'effective', 'capacity', 'conduct', 'certification', 'oversight', 'properly', 'clear', 'assessment', 'visit', 'report', 'committee', 'systemic', 'weakness', 'term', 'personnel', 'management', 'say', 'documentation', 'accompany', 'blacklisting', 'decision', 'visit', 'reveal', 'committee', 'lack', 'procedure', 'determine', 'manpower', 'requirement', 'training', 'requirement', 'well', 'implementation', 'lack', 'structure', 'documentmanagement', 'system', 'assure', 'certification', 'traceability', 'well', 'qualitymanagement', 'function', 'need', 'oversee', 'administration', 'effective', 'transposition', 'legal', 'regulatory', 'technical', 'requirement', 'committee', 'unable', 'provide', 'request', 'evidence', 'activity', 'perform', 'part', 'initial', 'operator', 'certificate', 'process', 'certify', 'carrier', 'blacklist', 'documentation', 'state', 'examination', 'carrier', 'visit', 'turn', 'several', 'issue', 'add', 'detect', 'part', 'regulatory', 'oversight', 'operator', 'civil', 'committee', 'invite', 'formal', 'european', 'safety', 'hearing', 'may', 'operator', 'include', 'aircompany', 'armenia', 'atlantis', 'armenian', 'atlantis', 'european', 'airway', 'armenia', 'airway', 'armenian', 'helicopter', 'hotair', 'balloon', 'firm', 'skyball', 'hearing', 'armenian', 'committee', 'outline', 'safety', 'improvement', 'make', 'since', 'visit', 'particularly', 'regard', 'personnel', 'document', 'management', 'improvement', 'operation', 'department', 'operator', 'certification', 'inspector', 'training', 'regulatory', 'inform', 'take', 'step', 'revoke', 'certification', 'armenian', 'carrier', 'consider', 'noncompliant', 'international', 'safety', 'standard', 'european', 'safety', 'team', 'acknowledge', 'situation', 'armenia', 'result', 'long', 'period', 'inefficiency', 'neglect', 'rectification', 'measure', 'pursue', 'government', 'support', 'add', 'civil', 'committee', 'capability', 'oversee', 'activity', 'insufficient', 'meet', 'minimum', 'standard', 'significant', 'far', 'improvement', 'committee', 'capability', 'necessary', 'order', 'address', 'current', 'safety', 'deficiency', 'blacklist', 'documentation', 'add', 'cite', 'deficiency', 'personnel', 'management', 'training', 'well', 'inadequate', 'certification', 'process', 'ineffective', 'oversight', 'operator', 'provide', 'evidence', 'hearing', 'fail', 'convince', 'european', 'safety', 'team', 'capable', 'independent', 'selfregulation', 'none', 'information', 'evidence', 'provide', 'carrier', 'hearing', 'provide', 'assurance', 'lack', 'safety', 'oversight', 'civil', 'committee', 'mitigate', 'carrier', 'compliance', 'safety', 'system', 'documentation', 'say', 'european', 'transport', 'commissioner', 'adina', 'valean', 'say', 'decision', 'impose', 'blanket', 'blacklisting', 'armenia', 'unanimous', 'commission', 'european', 'union', 'safety', 'agency', 'ready', 'cooperate', 'invest', 'armenia', 'improve', 'safety']"
"Greece has suspended flights to and from Qatar until mid-June after 12 passengers arriving in Athens on a Qatar Airways flight from Doha tested positive for Covid-19. The Greek civil protection ministry states that 12 of the 91 people on board the 1 June Qatar Airways flight tested positive for the virus on arrival in Athens. Those 12 people will now be quarantined in a hotel for 14 days, while the arrivals who tested negative will be isolated for a week before being tested again. “We also announce that after the above epidemiological data, flights to and from Qatar will be suspended until 15 June,” says the ministry. Qatar Airways has maintained flights to at least 30 destinations throughout the coronavirus pandemic, and is in the process of reinstating service to 80 cities by the end of June. The airline announced on 3 June that it would resume flights to Venice on 15 July and increase frequencies to Dublin, Milan and Rome from 13 June. Greece has a relatively low number of confirmed Covid-19 cases compared with many other countries, including Qatar. Data from Johns Hopkins University shows that Greece has 2,937 cases, while Qatar has 60,259. The country is reopening its tourism market in three phases. Until 15 June, international flights are permitted to arrive only in national capital Athens and all passengers must be tested and quarantined, says Greece's ministry of foreign affairs. Between 15 and 30 June, international flights will also be allowed to land at Thessaloniki. Passengers arriving from airports that are not included on European Union Aviation Safety Agency's list of areas considered to have a high risk of Covid-19 transmission will be subject to random testing.

"Lufthansa Group has confirmed earlier guidance that it made an adjusted EBIT loss of €1.2 billion ($1.3 billion) in the first quarter and warns it expects around 300 aircraft still to be parked next year. The group, which has just agreed conditions on a vital €9 billion state loan to support it through the crisis, is embarking on restructuring talks with unions. It also says it is in negotiations over “extensive postponements” of planned aircraft deliveries and is examining the sale of non-core business units in the medium term. Lufthansa, which delayed full publication of its first-quarter results from 30 April because of the pandemic, had already flagged the likely loss in a market statement on 23 April. The figure, which compares with a loss of €336 million in the same period of 2019, was driven by an 18% fall in revenues to €6.4 billion. Passenger numbers across the group were down 26% in the first quarter and load factors slid almost five points to 73.3%. Crisis-related asset impairments and the negative development of its fuel hedges further dented performance at a net level. The group recorded impairment charges of €266 million on decommissioned aircraft and €157 million on the goodwill of LSG North America and Eurowings. Fuel hedging hits had a €950 million impact in the quarter. These pushed the group's net loss to €2.1 billion for the three months ending 31 March. The group says the uncertain further development of the pandemic makes it impossible to give a precise forecast of the earnings trend for 2020. But it says it continues to expect a “significant decline” in adjusted EBIT. “Global air traffic has come to a virtual standstill in recent months. This has impacted our quarterly results to an unprecedented extent,” says group chairman Carsten Spohr. ”In view of the very slow recovery in demand, we must now take far-reaching restructuring measures to counteract this.” Passenger numbers across the group in April were down 98% as it carried just 241,000 customers across a skeleton service. Passenger load factor slumped 36 percentage points, to 47.5%. While freight load factors improved in its cargo operation, the big reduction in bellyhold capacity on passenger aircraft meant its freight traffic was still down 53% in April. Lufthansa Group carriers have parked around 700 of their 763 aircraft during the crisis. The group though is resuming a number of services from the middle of this month and now expects to operate 40% of its original schedule by September. This will cover around 70% of its long-haul destinations and 90% of its short-haul destinations. But the group expects 300 aircraft will still be parked in 2021, and 200 in 2022. ”Even after the end of the crisis, which is expected to end in 2023, the group expects its fleet to remain 100 aircraft smaller. A considerable decline in demand is also initially expected for the service companies' third-party business,” it says. While Lufthansa says has cut its fixed costs by a one-third since the crisis began, the group says it is consuming €800 million of liquidity reserves each month. It also notes the reimbursement of cancelled tickets and repayment of financial liabilities that have fallen due “will have a foreseeable negative impact on our liquidity development”. At the end of May Lufthansa's supervisory board approved a €9 billion state support package offered by the German federal WSF fund. “In order to repay the loans and coupons quickly, we will have to significantly increase our annual free cash flow compared to pre-crisis levels - even though global demand for flights will remain below pre-crisis levels for years to come,” says Thorsten Dirks, board member for digital and finance. “This will only succeed if we implement restructuring programmes in all areas of the group and agree on innovative solutions with the unions and working councils.” Restructuring programmes are already under way at its Austrian Airlines and Brussels Airlines units - the former having agreed a long-term 20% cut in its fleet and personnel costs. “Restructuring and cost-cutting programs will also be launched in other Lufthansa Group companies,” the company says. “Negotiations with aircraft manufacturers on extensive postponements of planned aircraft takeovers are continuing. In addition, the sale of individual non-core business units is being examined in the medium term.”",6,107,3.0,0.2579,"passenger, loss, operating, revenue, traffic, month, increase, capacity, decline, result","['lufthansa', 'confirm', 'earlier', 'guidance', 'make', 'adjust', 'ebit', 'loss', 'quarter', 'warns', 'expect', 'around', 'still', 'park', 'next', 'agree', 'condition', 'vital', 'state', 'loan', 'support', 'crisis', 'embark', 'restructuring', 'talk', 'union', 'say', 'negotiation', 'extensive', 'postponement', 'plan', 'delivery', 'examine', 'sale', 'noncore', 'business', 'unit', 'medium', 'term', 'lufthansa', 'delayed', 'full', 'publication', 'firstquarter', 'result', 'april', 'pandemic', 'already', 'flag', 'likely', 'loss', 'market', 'statement', 'april', 'figure', 'compare', 'loss', 'period', 'driven', 'fall', 'revenue', 'passenger', 'number', 'across', 'quarter', 'load', 'factor', 'slid', 'almost', 'point', 'crisisrelated', 'asset', 'impairment', 'negative', 'development', 'fuel', 'hedge', 'far', 'dent', 'performance', 'net', 'level', 'record', 'impairment', 'charge', 'decommission', 'goodwill', 'lsg', 'north', 'america', 'eurowings', 'fuel', 'hedge', 'hit', 'impact', 'quarter', 'push', 'net', 'loss', 'month', 'end', 'march', 'say', 'uncertain', 'far', 'development', 'pandemic', 'make', 'impossible', 'give', 'precise', 'forecast', 'earnings', 'trend', 'say', 'continue', 'expect', 'significant', 'decline', 'adjust', 'ebit', 'global', 'traffic', 'come', 'virtual', 'standstill', 'recent', 'month', 'impact', 'quarterly', 'result', 'unprecedented', 'extent', 'say', 'chairman', 'carsten', 'spohr', 'view', 'slow', 'recovery', 'demand', 'must', 'take', 'farreaching', 'restructuring', 'measure', 'counteract', 'passenger', 'number', 'across', 'april', 'carry', 'customer', 'across', 'skeleton', 'service', 'passenger', 'load', 'factor', 'slump', 'percentage', 'point', 'freight', 'load', 'factor', 'improve', 'cargo', 'operation', 'big', 'reduction', 'bellyhold', 'capacity', 'passenger', 'meant', 'freight', 'traffic', 'still', 'april', 'lufthansa', 'carrier', 'park', 'around', 'crisis', 'though', 'resume', 'number', 'service', 'middle', 'month', 'expect', 'operate', 'original', 'schedule', 'september', 'cover', 'around', 'longhaul', 'destination', 'shorthaul', 'destination', 'expect', 'still', 'park', 'even', 'end', 'crisis', 'expect', 'end', 'expect', 'fleet', 'remain', 'small', 'considerable', 'decline', 'demand', 'initially', 'expect', 'service', 'thirdparty', 'business', 'say', 'lufthansa', 'say', 'cut', 'fix', 'cost', 'onethird', 'since', 'crisis', 'begin', 'say', 'consume', 'liquidity', 'reserve', 'month', 'note', 'reimbursement', 'cancel', 'ticket', 'repayment', 'financial', 'liability', 'fall', 'due', 'foreseeable', 'negative', 'impact', 'liquidity', 'development', 'end', 'may', 'lufthansa', 'supervisory', 'board', 'approve', 'state', 'support', 'package', 'offer', 'german', 'federal', 'wsf', 'fund', 'order', 'repay', 'loan', 'coupon', 'quickly', 'significantly', 'increase', 'annual', 'free', 'cash', 'flow', 'compare', 'precrisis', 'level', 'even', 'though', 'global', 'demand', 'remain', 'precrisis', 'level', 'come', 'say', 'thorsten', 'dirk', 'board', 'member', 'digital', 'finance', 'succeed', 'implement', 'restructuring', 'programme', 'area', 'agree', 'innovative', 'solution', 'union', 'work', 'restructuring', 'programme', 'already', 'way', 'austrian', 'brussels', 'unit', 'former', 'agree', 'longterm', 'cut', 'fleet', 'personnel', 'cost', 'restructuring', 'costcutting', 'program', 'launch', 'lufthansa', 'say', 'negotiation', 'manufacturer', 'extensive', 'postponement', 'plan', 'takeover', 'continue', 'addition', 'sale', 'individual', 'noncore', 'business', 'unit', 'examine', 'medium', 'term']"
"Despite the negative impact of the coronavirus outbreak across various segments of the aviation industry, there are pockets of growth opportunities, such as digital solutions and research and development. Consultancy firm Frost & Sullivan, in its latest analysis report of the global commercial aircraft market, also notes that amid the backdrop of disruption from the pandemic, “some aerospace companies, especially suppliers, will be positioned to experience extreme growth as some competitors may cease to exist”. To this end, the report states that digitalisation is one possible growth opportunity. It calls on aerospace companies to invest in digital platforms “for every aspect of aircraft production as customers look for turnkey solutions”. “Market players can leverage emerging digital technologies such as blockchain to help comply with regulator-mandated traceability requirements of many aerospace digital services,” the report adds. As for the broader industry, the consultancy says there is a need to continue investing in research and development of other technologies, including additive manufacturing, robotics and artificial intelligence. The report also outlines two sets of revenue forecasts for the aerospace industry. Under the conservative scenario, it states that the market will “witness a dramatic drop in revenues”, reaching about $149 billion this year. By 2025, this figure is expected to hit about $272 billion. Taking a more optimistic outlook in which the industry rebounds at a faster pace, the consultancy estimates revenue to be around $412 billion by 2025, at a compound annual growth rate of 6.2%. Says Frost & Sullivan's aerospace and defence analyst Timothy Kuder: “2020 was going to be a year of reconfiguration that would not only affect Boeing because of its 737 Max grounding saga, but the whole industry...[It] has now turned into a year of survival.” Frost & Sullivan also notes that the “premature and ...overabundance of lease returns offer opportunities for OEMs, airlines, suppliers, and the aftermarket”, with Kuder adding that the pandemic will force the adjustment of the lessor structure of purchasing aircraft.",6,108,9.0,0.2991,"industry, crisis, demand, coronavirus, global, iata, market, level, cargo, expect","['despite', 'negative', 'impact', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'across', 'various', 'segment', 'industry', 'pocket', 'growth', 'opportunity', 'digital', 'solution', 'research', 'development', 'consultancy', 'firm', 'frost', 'sullivan', 'late', 'analysis', 'report', 'global', 'commercial', 'market', 'note', 'amid', 'backdrop', 'disruption', 'pandemic', 'especially', 'supplier', 'position', 'experience', 'extreme', 'growth', 'competitor', 'may', 'cease', 'exist', 'end', 'report', 'state', 'digitalisation', 'possible', 'growth', 'opportunity', 'call', 'invest', 'digital', 'platform', 'every', 'aspect', 'production', 'customer', 'look', 'turnkey', 'solution', 'market', 'player', 'leverage', 'emerge', 'digital', 'technology', 'blockchain', 'help', 'comply', 'regulatormandated', 'traceability', 'requirement', 'many', 'digital', 'service', 'report', 'add', 'broader', 'industry', 'consultancy', 'say', 'need', 'continue', 'invest', 'research', 'development', 'technology', 'include', 'additive', 'manufacturing', 'robotics', 'artificial', 'intelligence', 'report', 'outline', 'set', 'revenue', 'forecast', 'industry', 'conservative', 'scenario', 'state', 'market', 'witness', 'dramatic', 'drop', 'revenue', 'reach', 'figure', 'expect', 'hit', 'take', 'optimistic', 'outlook', 'industry', 'rebound', 'faster', 'pace', 'consultancy', 'estimate', 'revenue', 'around', 'compound', 'annual', 'growth', 'rate', 'say', 'frost', 'sullivan', 'defence', 'analyst', 'timothy', 'kuder', 'go', 'reconfiguration', 'affect', 'ground', 'saga', 'whole', 'industry', 'turn', 'frost', 'sullivan', 'note', 'premature', 'overabundance', 'lease', 'return', 'offer', 'opportunity', 'oems', 'supplier', 'aftermarket', 'kuder', 'add', 'pandemic', 'force', 'adjustment', 'lessor', 'structure', 'purchasing']"

The inquiry team has yet to release any detailed information about the circumstances of the 22 May accident.

"French investigators believe cabin crew's increased workload, after an unexpected change of aircraft type, meant a trolley was left unsecured and injured several passengers when it broke free. The accident occurred on board an Air France Boeing 777-300ER (F-GSQL) departing Mauritius for Paris Charles de Gaulle on 16 September 2018. French investigation authority BEA says the aircraft was a replacement for one with a different configuration. While there are procedures for advising of, and preparing for, such a change, the inquiry found the operations control centre transmitted the wrong configuration data. This incorrect configuration not only implied changes including a significant number of business-class upgrades – with some four times as many business seats as the normal cabin layout on the route – and changes to the crew and catering. But the information could not be accessed through the crew's tablets early enough, meaning the preparation of the flight and the boarding process were disrupted. “In order to limit the impact on on-board service during the flight, the cabin crew made numerous adjustments within the cabin,” says BEA, adding that these additional tasks led the cabin crew to “deviate” from roles normally assigned to them. The disruption crucially meant a final pre-take-off galley check was not carried out and, during the departure, an unrestrained trolley left its housing at the forward galley and rolled rapidly along the right-hand aisle, travelling three-quarters of the length of the aircraft and injuring eight passengers. Among them was the passenger in seat 25K, who was leaning into the aisle and was struck in the face and badly injured. The trolley, about 1m tall and 0.8m in length, continued to roll until it reached seat 39J in the economy-class cabin. The passenger was treated by medical personnel on board and cabin crew, and the flight continued to Paris without diversion. BEA says the crew's late receipt of the cabin preparation information meant they had to “quickly adapt to an unanticipated situation” and did not consider the advisability of postponing certain on-board services – with the result that they focused on the commercial desire to satisfy passengers to the “detriment” of certain safety actions.",6,110,7.0,0.2729,"crew, runway, inquiry, land, approach, accident, investigator, captain, incident, pilot","['french', 'investigator', 'believe', 'cabin', 'crew', 'increase', 'workload', 'unexpected', 'change', 'type', 'meant', 'trolley', 'left', 'unsecured', 'injured', 'several', 'passenger', 'broke', 'free', 'accident', 'occur', 'board', 'france', 'fgsql', 'depart', 'mauritius', 'paris', 'charles', 'de', 'gaulle', 'september', 'french', 'investigation', 'authority', 'bea', 'say', 'replacement', 'different', 'configuration', 'procedure', 'advise', 'prepare', 'change', 'inquiry', 'found', 'operation', 'control', 'centre', 'transmit', 'wrong', 'configuration', 'data', 'incorrect', 'configuration', 'imply', 'change', 'include', 'significant', 'number', 'businessclass', 'upgrade', 'many', 'business', 'seat', 'normal', 'cabin', 'layout', 'route', 'change', 'crew', 'catering', 'information', 'access', 'crew', 'tablet', 'early', 'enough', 'meaning', 'preparation', 'boarding', 'process', 'disrupt', 'order', 'limit', 'impact', 'onboard', 'service', 'cabin', 'crew', 'make', 'numerous', 'adjustment', 'within', 'cabin', 'say', 'bea', 'add', 'additional', 'task', 'lead', 'cabin', 'crew', 'deviate', 'role', 'normally', 'assign', 'disruption', 'crucially', 'meant', 'final', 'pretakeoff', 'galley', 'check', 'carry', 'departure', 'unrestrained', 'trolley', 'left', 'housing', 'forward', 'galley', 'roll', 'rapidly', 'along', 'righthand', 'aisle', 'travel', 'threequarters', 'length', 'injure', 'passenger', 'among', 'passenger', 'seat', 'lean', 'aisle', 'struck', 'face', 'badly', 'injured', 'trolley', 'tall', 'length', 'continued', 'roll', 'reach', 'seat', 'economyclass', 'cabin', 'passenger', 'treat', 'medical', 'personnel', 'board', 'cabin', 'crew', 'continued', 'paris', 'without', 'diversion', 'bea', 'say', 'crew', 'late', 'receipt', 'cabin', 'preparation', 'information', 'meant', 'quickly', 'adapt', 'unanticipated', 'situation', 'consider', 'advisability', 'postpone', 'certain', 'onboard', 'service', 'result', 'focus', 'commercial', 'desire', 'satisfy', 'passenger', 'detriment', 'certain', 'safety', 'action']"
"Global air freight demand was down nearly 28% in April compared with a year earlier, according to IATA – the sharpest fall ever recorded. But because three-quarters of passenger aircraft belly space was removed from the market by the coronavirus grounding, there was still insufficient capacity to meet demand. Total capacity was cut 42% in April, though there was a 15% rise in dedicated freighter capacity. The worst-hit regions were Latin America, the Middle East and Europe, with demand down by over a third and capacity by over 40%. In Latin America, capacity more than halved. “There is a severe capacity crunch in air cargo,” states IATA director general and chief executive Alexandre de Juniac. “Airlines are deploying as much capacity as possible, including special charter operations and the temporary use of passenger cabins for cargo. Governments need to continue to ensure that vital supply lines remain open and efficient.” He highlights Africa and Latin America as two regions where government red tape is preventing the industry from flexibly deploying its aircraft to respond to the coronavirus crisis.

"Investigators have determined that snow-clearance at Usinsk airport was inadequate before a landing accident in which a Utair Boeing 737-500 struck a shallow snow bank, about 1.1m high, situated 32m before the runway. The inquiry has also revealed that the aircraft was consistently slightly low on its descent path during the approach. Flight UT595 had been inbound from Moscow Vnukovo on 9 February and, while the weather at Usinsk had appeared marginal, the crew opted not to divert, in the belief the conditions would improve. Russia's Interstate Aviation Committee says, in interim findings, that the crew decided to conduct a satellite-based area navigation approach, with NDB back-up, following the GIGES 1L pattern. This required passing the GIGES waypoint, following a heading of 021° to the YS001 initial approach fix, then turning right to intercept intermediate fix YS004 and then YS005 on the inbound approach path to runway 13. After passing the transition altitude the crew set the altimeter to the QNH level of 999mb. But when the aircraft reached YS001, crossing it in a right turn, it was flying at 2,210ft – slightly below the 2,240ft QNH height listed on the chart. The crew received a weather update confirming the runway visibility was sufficient to land, and proceeded to pass the YS004 point at 2,200ft, again below the 2,240ft listed. Investigators state that the first officer then referred to a descent altitude of 1,500ft as the aircraft headed for YS005 – which has a QNH height requirement of 1,570ft – and passed it at 1,530ft. During the descent the captain, who had remarked about the “whiteness” of the snow-covered ground, also expressed concern about the wind before configuring the aircraft with a flap setting of 30. But the inquiry says the wind speed gradually fell from 40kt to 14kt as the aircraft descended and there was no alert over sudden wind changes. Cleared to land, and with the runway in sight, the aircraft flew over both the outer and inner marker beacons at heights some 40-50ft lower than required. The pilot did not mention the heights over the markers but the first officer cautioned the captain to avoid descending below the glidepath, and warned again as the aircraft reached 100ft. Engine thrust was increased, causing a slight increase in pitch, but this was countered by a push on the control column. The inquiry says that, below 50ft, no actions were taken to reduce the descent rate. The aircraft struck a 1.1m bank of snow, located 32m before the runway entrance, while travelling at 138kt and pitched 3° nose-up. It then touched down with a 1.86g impact, its right-hand main landing-gear shearing off while the left-hand assembly collapsed, causing the jet to settle onto its engines and aft fuselage underside. The crew apparently was not aware of the damage to the undercarriage, because the captain ordered reverse-thrust and speedbrake deployment before finding that the braking and nose-wheel could not be controlled. It slid to a halt, spinning 80° clockwise relative to the centreline. None of the 100 occupants was injured. Investigators have yet to reach formal conclusions on the cause of the accident. But the inquiry points out that the winter preparations of Usinsk airport were not in line with regulations, with snow clearance “not fully carried out” in the area of the entrance to runway 13.",6,112,7.0,0.6276,"crew, runway, inquiry, land, approach, accident, investigator, captain, incident, pilot","['investigator', 'determine', 'snowclearance', 'usinsk', 'airport', 'inadequate', 'land', 'accident', 'utair', 'struck', 'shallow', 'snow', 'bank', 'high', 'situate', 'runway', 'inquiry', 'reveal', 'consistently', 'slightly', 'low', 'descent', 'path', 'approach', 'inbound', 'moscow', 'vnukovo', 'february', 'weather', 'usinsk', 'appear', 'marginal', 'crew', 'opt', 'divert', 'belief', 'condition', 'improve', 'russia', 'interstate', 'committee', 'say', 'interim', 'finding', 'crew', 'decide', 'conduct', 'satellitebased', 'area', 'navigation', 'approach', 'ndb', 'backup', 'follow', 'giges', 'pattern', 'require', 'passing', 'giges', 'waypoint', 'follow', 'head', 'initial', 'approach', 'fix', 'turn', 'right', 'intercept', 'intermediate', 'fix', 'inbound', 'approach', 'path', 'runway', 'passing', 'transition', 'altitude', 'crew', 'set', 'altimeter', 'qnh', 'level', 'reach', 'cross', 'right', 'turn', 'fly', 'slightly', 'qnh', 'height', 'list', 'chart', 'crew', 'receive', 'weather', 'update', 'confirm', 'runway', 'visibility', 'sufficient', 'land', 'proceed', 'pas', 'point', 'list', 'investigator', 'state', 'officer', 'refer', 'descent', 'altitude', 'head', 'qnh', 'height', 'requirement', 'pass', 'descent', 'captain', 'remark', 'whiteness', 'snowcovered', 'ground', 'express', 'concern', 'wind', 'configure', 'flap', 'set', 'inquiry', 'say', 'wind', 'speed', 'gradually', 'fell', 'descend', 'alert', 'sudden', 'wind', 'change', 'clear', 'land', 'runway', 'sight', 'flew', 'outer', 'inner', 'marker', 'beacon', 'height', 'low', 'require', 'pilot', 'mention', 'height', 'marker', 'officer', 'caution', 'captain', 'avoid', 'descend', 'glidepath', 'warn', 'reach', 'engine', 'thrust', 'increase', 'cause', 'slight', 'increase', 'pitch', 'counter', 'push', 'control', 'column', 'inquiry', 'say', 'action', 'take', 'reduce', 'descent', 'rate', 'struck', 'bank', 'snow', 'locate', 'runway', 'entrance', 'travel', 'pitch', 'noseup', 'touch', 'impact', 'righthand', 'main', 'landinggear', 'shear', 'lefthand', 'assembly', 'collapse', 'cause', 'jet', 'settle', 'onto', 'engine', 'aft', 'fuselage', 'underside', 'crew', 'apparently', 'aware', 'damage', 'undercarriage', 'captain', 'order', 'reversethrust', 'speedbrake', 'deployment', 'find', 'brake', 'nosewheel', 'control', 'slid', 'halt', 'spin', 'clockwise', 'relative', 'centreline', 'none', 'occupant', 'injured', 'investigator', 'yet', 'reach', 'formal', 'conclusion', 'cause', 'accident', 'inquiry', 'point', 'winter', 'preparation', 'usinsk', 'airport', 'line', 'regulation', 'snow', 'clearance', 'fully', 'carry', 'area', 'entrance', 'runway']"
"In November 2017, an Indonesia AirAsia first officer assumed the departure runway from Perth would be the same as the arrival runway, and inputed the wrong data into the flight management guidance system. As a result, the Airbus A320 made a left turn after take off that was lower than minimum specified height, and deviated from the flight path instructed by air traffic controllers. In its final investigation report, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) says that “deviating from standard procedures, even slightly, can render them ineffective and result in errors.” Investigations revealed that on 24 November 2017 the aircraft, registered PK-AZE, was preparing to depart Perth for Denpasar. As part of pre-flight checks, the first officer, who was the pilot flying, had to input flight data into the flight management guidance system (FMGS). He programmed the arrival runway, 03, into the system, “as experienced on previous occasions”. Investigations found out that he did not follow the airline's standard procedure of first listening in to the automatic terminal information service, which stated that the runway to be used was the opposite, Runway 21. Instead, after obtaining the information from the automatic terminal information service, he scribbled the information down on a separate sheet of paper, but did not rectify the FMGS. The captain was also found to have not listened in to the information service, and “likely relied on the briefing conducted by the first officer”. The ATSB adds: “Despite the various cues available to the flight crew, including several ATC instructions for using runway 21 and airport signage, and the flight crew reporting feelings of unease about the flight preparations, the incorrect programming of the FMGS was not detected.” Shortly after taking off from Runway 21, the aircraft flight director indicated a left turn, as the next programmed waypoint was behind the aircraft and in the opposite direction. Perth ATC noticed the deviation and corrected the crew's heading. The crew also noticed the error and turned the aircraft to the correct track. However, instead of selecting the heading assigned by the ATC, the captain reprogrammed the correct flight plan in the FMGS. “This resulted in the aircraft turning through the assigned heading, requiring further instructions by ATC,” the ATSB states. It notes that the ATC was “unaware of the nature of the problem” and was not “utilised fully” to assist the flight crew. The aircraft, which was carrying 145 passengers and six crew, finally returned to its planned track and continued to Denpasar without further incident. Following the incident, Indonesia AirAsia has included a “change of departure runway” scenario in its line operations flight training. It has also rolled out training for its pilots in the area of threat and error management. The ATSB says the incident “further highlights the significance of stopping and re-evaluating the situation while on the ground when there is a feeling of uncertainty about the flight, even if it results in undesirable delays”. It adds: “This provides an opportunity to detect errors before they affect operations. Once airborne, workload and time limitations become even more critical due to the rapidly changing situation.” Cirium fleets data indicates PK-AZE was delivered to Indonesia AirAsia in 2013.",6,113,7.0,0.3876,"crew, runway, inquiry, land, approach, accident, investigator, captain, incident, pilot","['november', 'indonesia', 'airasia', 'officer', 'assume', 'departure', 'runway', 'perth', 'arrival', 'runway', 'input', 'wrong', 'data', 'management', 'guidance', 'system', 'result', 'make', 'left', 'turn', 'take', 'low', 'minimum', 'specify', 'height', 'deviate', 'path', 'instruct', 'traffic', 'controller', 'final', 'investigation', 'report', 'australian', 'transport', 'safety', 'bureau', 'atsb', 'say', 'deviate', 'standard', 'procedure', 'even', 'slightly', 'render', 'ineffective', 'result', 'investigation', 'reveal', 'november', 'register', 'pkaze', 'prepare', 'depart', 'perth', 'denpasar', 'part', 'preflight', 'check', 'officer', 'pilot', 'fly', 'input', 'data', 'management', 'guidance', 'system', 'fmgs', 'programmed', 'arrival', 'runway', 'system', 'experienced', 'previous', 'occasion', 'investigation', 'found', 'follow', 'standard', 'procedure', 'listen', 'automatic', 'terminal', 'information', 'service', 'state', 'runway', 'use', 'opposite', 'runway', 'instead', 'obtain', 'information', 'automatic', 'terminal', 'information', 'service', 'scribble', 'information', 'separate', 'sheet', 'paper', 'rectify', 'fmgs', 'captain', 'found', 'listen', 'information', 'service', 'likely', 'rely', 'briefing', 'conduct', 'officer', 'atsb', 'add', 'despite', 'various', 'cue', 'available', 'crew', 'include', 'several', 'atc', 'instruction', 'use', 'runway', 'airport', 'signage', 'crew', 'reporting', 'feeling', 'unease', 'preparation', 'incorrect', 'program', 'fmgs', 'shortly', 'take', 'runway', 'director', 'indicate', 'left', 'turn', 'next', 'programmed', 'waypoint', 'behind', 'opposite', 'direction', 'perth', 'atc', 'notice', 'deviation', 'correct', 'crew', 'head', 'crew', 'notice', 'error', 'turn', 'correct', 'track', 'however', 'instead', 'select', 'head', 'assign', 'atc', 'captain', 'reprogrammed', 'correct', 'plan', 'fmgs', 'result', 'turn', 'assign', 'head', 'require', 'far', 'instruction', 'atc', 'atsb', 'state', 'note', 'atc', 'unaware', 'nature', 'problem', 'utilised', 'fully', 'assist', 'crew', 'carry', 'passenger', 'crew', 'finally', 'return', 'plan', 'track', 'continued', 'denpasar', 'without', 'far', 'incident', 'follow', 'incident', 'indonesia', 'airasia', 'include', 'change', 'departure', 'runway', 'scenario', 'line', 'operation', 'training', 'roll', 'training', 'pilot', 'area', 'threat', 'error', 'management', 'atsb', 'say', 'incident', 'far', 'highlight', 'significance', 'stop', 'reevaluate', 'situation', 'ground', 'feel', 'uncertainty', 'even', 'result', 'undesirable', 'delay', 'add', 'provide', 'opportunity', 'detect', 'error', 'affect', 'operation', 'airborne', 'workload', 'limitation', 'become', 'even', 'critical', 'due', 'rapidly', 'change', 'fleet', 'data', 'indicates', 'pkaze', 'deliver', 'indonesia', 'airasia']"
"Embraer is exploring new partnerships for the KC-390 military transport after Boeing terminated its joint-venture agreement with the Brazilian company in April. The airframer remains positive about the international prospects for the aircraft, despite losing the sales network of the aerospace giant and a potential entry point into the US military market, it said in a first-quarter 2020 earnings call on 1 June. “The original business plan for the [KC-390] did not include countries such as the US, for example. So the market perspective remains positive for the [KC-390],” says Francisco Gomes Neto, chief executive of Embraer. “And of course, I mean here we also have opportunities for future partnerships. But at this moment, we are still in the process to evaluate alternatives and possible business models.” Gomes Neto does not name potential collaborators on the KC-390, though China and India have been mentioned as possible partners for the company's commercial aviation division. Partnerships with companies in those Asian countries could open huge regional airliner markets for the manufacturer's E-Jets. However, linking the production or sale of the KC-390 to China or India could be tricky given fraught geopolitics. In particular, increasing Western hostility towards Beijing amid the coronavirus crisis and rivalry with the USA might make such a deal difficult. The USA remains an important market for the Sierra Nevada/Embraer A-29 Super Tucano light-attack aircraft. Washington also has the ability to issue financial sanctions against countries who buy aircraft from nations it does not like, a tool it has used to hurt sales of Russian military aircraft. Nonetheless, partnering with a company with strategic ties to a foreign government could help sales of the KC-390 as deals for military aircraft often are influenced by local politics. For example, the first international customer for the KC-390 was Portugal, a country with strong historical ties to Brazil and with industrial participation in the programme. Embraer says it started production of the first of Lisbon's five jets in late 2019. The company has five KC-390s at different stages of production. It anticipates delivering two more examples to the Brazilian air force by the end of 2020, in line with its first-quarter projections. In 2019, the company delivered two KC-390s to Brasilia. Embraer's defence and security business unit generated $149 million in revenue in the first quarter of 2020, a 16.9% decline compared to the same period a year earlier. The company's financial performance across all its divisions, including military, commercial airliner, business jet and service units, fell 23% in the first quarter, to $634 million.",6,114,0.0,0.3503,"order, business, jet, delivery, production, customer, deliver, commercial, quarter, include","['embraer', 'explore', 'partnership', 'military', 'transport', 'terminate', 'jointventure', 'agreement', 'brazilian', 'april', 'airframer', 'remains', 'positive', 'international', 'prospect', 'despite', 'lose', 'sale', 'network', 'giant', 'potential', 'entry', 'point', 'u', 'military', 'market', 'say', 'firstquarter', 'earnings', 'call', 'june', 'original', 'business', 'plan', 'include', 'country', 'u', 'example', 'market', 'perspective', 'remains', 'positive', 'say', 'francisco', 'gomes', 'neto', 'chief', 'executive', 'embraer', 'course', 'mean', 'opportunity', 'future', 'partnership', 'moment', 'still', 'process', 'evaluate', 'alternative', 'possible', 'business', 'gomes', 'neto', 'name', 'potential', 'collaborator', 'though', 'india', 'mention', 'possible', 'partner', 'commercial', 'division', 'partnership', 'asian', 'country', 'open', 'huge', 'regional', 'airliner', 'market', 'manufacturer', 'ejets', 'however', 'link', 'production', 'sale', 'india', 'tricky', 'give', 'fraught', 'geopolitics', 'particular', 'increase', 'western', 'hostility', 'towards', 'beijing', 'amid', 'coronavirus', 'crisis', 'rivalry', 'usa', 'might', 'make', 'deal', 'difficult', 'usa', 'remains', 'important', 'market', 'sierra', 'super', 'tucano', 'lightattack', 'washington', 'ability', 'issue', 'financial', 'sanction', 'country', 'buy', 'nation', 'like', 'tool', 'use', 'hurt', 'sale', 'russian', 'military', 'nonetheless', 'partner', 'strategic', 'tie', 'foreign', 'government', 'help', 'sale', 'deal', 'military', 'often', 'influence', 'local', 'politics', 'example', 'international', 'customer', 'portugal', 'country', 'strong', 'historical', 'tie', 'brazil', 'industrial', 'participation', 'programme', 'embraer', 'say', 'start', 'production', 'lisbon', 'jet', 'late', 'different', 'stage', 'production', 'anticipates', 'deliver', 'example', 'brazilian', 'force', 'end', 'line', 'firstquarter', 'projection', 'deliver', 'brasilia', 'embraer', 'defence', 'security', 'business', 'unit', 'generate', 'revenue', 'quarter', 'decline', 'compare', 'period', 'earlier', 'financial', 'performance', 'across', 'division', 'include', 'military', 'commercial', 'airliner', 'business', 'jet', 'service', 'unit', 'fell', 'quarter']"
"Congo Airways' decision to swap orders for Embraer 175s to larger E190-E2s party reflects an effort by the company to expand on routes previously served by financially struggling competitor South African Airways (SAA). “This will be an opportunity for us...We wanted to increase the capacity,” says Kinshasa-based Congo's chief executive Desire Balazire Bantu. In December 2019, Congo ordered two 76-seat Embraer E175s and took options to acquire an additional two examples. Deliveries were to begin this December. But the government-funded carrier has now swapped those orders and options to four E190-E2s. It has also pushed back deliveries until May 2022, though the jets could arrive sooner, says Bantu. Congo will outfit the E190-E2s with 96 seats, including 12 in business class. It will use them to replace De Havilland Canada Dash 8-400s. Bantu notes that SAA has historically flown from Johannesburg to both Kinshasa, capital of Democratic Republic of Congo, and Lubumbashi, in the country's south. But with SAA's future uncertain amid a government-led rescue plan, Bantu seen an opportunity for Congo to expand on such routes. Another South African airline, Comair, has also struggled and in May filed for business rescue. Congo's other aircraft include two Airbus A320s and two Dash 8-400s.

"UK budget carrier Jet2's parent, Dart Group, has sold its sister logistics business to investor Culina Group. The divestment of Fowler Welch, for a gross cash consideration of £98 million, leaves Dart Group able to concentrate exclusively on the leisure airline operation. Jet2 is based at Leeds Bradford airport and has an associated travel operation Jet2holidays. But the carrier has had its flight programme suspended since mid-March, as a result of the coronavirus crisis, and Dart Group has moved to shore up liquidity. Although Dart Group has forecast a full-year profit of £265-270 million for the 12 months to 31 March, it says its exceptional charges will include £109 million relating to ineffectiveness of fuel and currency hedges. It recently raised £172 million in new capital, through a share placing, as part of its liquidity measures. Dart Group has also taken advantage of the UK government financing scheme developed to help businesses cope with the crisis. Divestment of Fowler Welch, it says, will enable Dart to “focus on its long-term strategy” of expanding its leisure travel operation, while enabling the logistic firm to “flourish” under new ownership.

"Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) has, from today, resumed allowing some transit passengers to use the airport. “From 1 June 2020 until further notice, only transit/transfer passengers who have been checked through at the origin port and take transit/transfer flights operated by the same airline group are accepted at HKIA,” the airport says. “Passengers should confirm in advance that they are able to enter the final destination. Please check with airlines for details.” The ban on non-Hong Kong residents entering the city remains in place, and all non-Hong Kong residents arriving from overseas by aircraft will be denied entry to Hong Kong, the airport says. As has been the case since 25 March, non-Hong Kong residents coming from mainland China, Macau, and Taiwan may enter, but are subjected to a 14-day compulsory quarantine. However, if they have travelled to other countries or regions within 14 days before coming to Hong Kong, they will be denied entry. Local carrier Cathay Pacific says that its passengers will be able to transit through Hong Kong if their itinerary is contained in a single booking and the connection time to their next Cathay Pacific or Cathay Dragon-operated flight is within 8h. “Subject to both requirements being met, from 1 June 2020, transit connections will be available between Hong Kong and the destinations that we operate flights to,” the airline says. However, in this “first phase” of reopening, transiting to and from destinations in mainland China is not allowed.

"Investigators have not been able to explain why the captain of a Diamond Aircraft DA62 calibration flight repeatedly breached minimum separation distances from commercial traffic at Dubai before a fatal wake-turbulence accident. Analysis of the accident sequence indicates the UK Flight Calibration Services DA62, conducting approaches to runway 30L, had been 90s behind a Thai Airways International Airbus A350-900 descending to the parallel 30R. Vortices from the A350's left and right wing drifted with the crosswind at about 4.5m/s and respectively reached the 30L approach path after 74s and 87s, according to the United Arab Emirates General Civil Aviation Authority. The analysis calculates that the vortices decayed to about 81% of their initial circulation strength at the point they reached the DA62 at 1,300ft altitude. It rolled to the left, losing about 100ft in height, recovering after 9s. But 7s later it abruptly rolled to the left again, becoming inverted before diving steeply into the ground. None of the four occupants survived the accident, on 16 May last year. The DA62 had conducted 10 approaches. The nature of the work meant it flew 200-900ft lower than preceding aircraft operating to runway 30R, and the captain had the discretion to self-separate horizontally. But the inquiry states that the captain – while concerned about A380 wake – appeared prepared to allow the light DA62 to breach normal ICAO separation between heavy and light aircraft, as well as the additional 3nm margin provided by Dubai air traffic control given the close proximity of runways 30L and 30R. The captain had previously informed that Dubai air navigation service that he was experienced with calibration flights at the airport and was “content to be tighter” than normal wake separation. “Other company pilots described him as safety conscious and they sometimes consulted him on flight operational issues,” says the inquiry. “The investigation carefully considered possible causes for the [captain's] misjudgment which led him to generally reduce the separation from other air traffic, but could not determine his reasoning.” It states that, for the first five of the 10 approaches, the air traffic controller provided cautionary warnings of possible wake turbulence from heavy aircraft using runway 30R. But for the subsequent five approaches, following a controller handover, these cautions were no longer issued. The inquiry says neither the provision of the advisories nor their absence influenced the captain's judgement regarding self-separation from preceding aircraft. “It is possible that the [captain] did not develop a mental picture of the surrounding air traffic, or simply underestimated the hazard,” it adds. “He may have compared the flight with other uneventful missions at single-runway airports.” Two A380s and four Boeing 777s were among the aircraft followed by the DA62, which trailed them by just 5-6nm compared with the Dubai standard of 9nm for the 777 and 11nm for the A380. “The [captain] had been provided with sufficient distance from preceding air traffic to establish a safe approach and was not provided with any time constraints by [controllers] that may have caused time pressure to complete the flight earlier,” the inquiry points out. During the 10th approach the aircraft was 200ft below and 3.7nm behind the A350-900 – compared with the 6nm separation standard for ICAO and 9nm standard for Dubai – when it was struck by the wake vortex. Airbus analysis for the inquiry states that, using ICAO separation, the vortex would have been 35-49% of its maximum strength at the point of the DA62 encounter, rather than around 70%.",6,118,7.0,0.483,"crew, runway, inquiry, land, approach, accident, investigator, captain, incident, pilot","['investigator', 'able', 'explain', 'captain', 'diamond', 'calibration', 'repeatedly', 'breach', 'minimum', 'separation', 'distance', 'commercial', 'traffic', 'dubai', 'fatal', 'waketurbulence', 'accident', 'analysis', 'accident', 'sequence', 'indicates', 'uk', 'calibration', 'service', 'conduct', 'approach', 'runway', 'behind', 'thai', 'airway', 'international', 'descend', 'parallel', 'vortex', 'left', 'right', 'wing', 'drift', 'crosswind', 'respectively', 'reach', 'approach', 'path', 'accord', 'united', 'arab', 'emirate', 'general', 'civil', 'authority', 'analysis', 'calculates', 'vortex', 'decayed', 'initial', 'circulation', 'strength', 'point', 'reach', 'altitude', 'roll', 'left', 'lose', 'height', 'recover', 'later', 'abruptly', 'roll', 'left', 'become', 'invert', 'dive', 'steeply', 'ground', 'none', 'occupant', 'survive', 'accident', 'may', 'conduct', 'approach', 'nature', 'work', 'meant', 'flew', 'low', 'precede', 'operating', 'runway', 'captain', 'discretion', 'selfseparate', 'horizontally', 'inquiry', 'state', 'captain', 'concerned', 'wake', 'appear', 'prepared', 'allow', 'light', 'breach', 'normal', 'icao', 'separation', 'heavy', 'light', 'well', 'additional', 'margin', 'provide', 'dubai', 'traffic', 'control', 'give', 'close', 'proximity', 'runway', 'captain', 'previously', 'inform', 'dubai', 'navigation', 'service', 'experienced', 'calibration', 'airport', 'content', 'tighter', 'normal', 'wake', 'separation', 'pilot', 'described', 'safety', 'conscious', 'sometimes', 'consult', 'operational', 'issue', 'say', 'inquiry', 'investigation', 'carefully', 'consider', 'possible', 'cause', 'captain', 'misjudgment', 'lead', 'generally', 'reduce', 'separation', 'traffic', 'determine', 'state', 'approach', 'traffic', 'controller', 'provide', 'cautionary', 'warning', 'possible', 'wake', 'turbulence', 'heavy', 'use', 'runway', 'subsequent', 'approach', 'follow', 'controller', 'handover', 'caution', 'longer', 'issue', 'inquiry', 'say', 'neither', 'provision', 'advisory', 'absence', 'influence', 'captain', 'judgement', 'regard', 'selfseparation', 'precede', 'possible', 'captain', 'develop', 'mental', 'picture', 'surround', 'traffic', 'simply', 'underestimated', 'hazard', 'add', 'may', 'compare', 'uneventful', 'mission', 'singlerunway', 'among', 'follow', 'trail', 'compare', 'dubai', 'standard', 'captain', 'provide', 'sufficient', 'distance', 'precede', 'traffic', 'establish', 'safe', 'approach', 'provide', 'constraint', 'controller', 'may', 'cause', 'pressure', 'complete', 'earlier', 'inquiry', 'point', 'approach', 'behind', 'compare', 'separation', 'standard', 'icao', 'standard', 'dubai', 'struck', 'wake', 'vortex', 'analysis', 'inquiry', 'state', 'use', 'icao', 'separation', 'vortex', 'maximum', 'strength', 'point', 'encounter', 'rather', 'around']"
"Bulgarian investigators have revealed that a Boeing MD-82 almost stalled while nose-high at low level, after the crew did not engage go-around thrust during a missed approach at Tarbes-Lourdes airport. The Bulgarian Air Charter aircraft descended to about 40ft while still nearly 500m from the runway, flying close to the ground for over 800m before a go-around decision and nearly 1.7km before the engines powered up. Such was the alarming attitude of the MD-82 that Tarbes air traffic controllers notified French investigators that they had watched the aircraft as it “flew over the entire runway” at abnormally high pitch and low speed, unable to climb, with its tail just 20m (65ft) from the ground. The controllers' notification compared the sight to that of the Air France Airbus A320 which failed to climb away and carved into a forest following a low pass at the 1988 Habsheim air show. But the MD-82, it states, managed to start climbing at the end of the runway, flew “very close to a hill” and turned left, diverting to Toulouse. Full details of the serious event could not be obtained because the aircraft's captain did not report the incident immediately to airline management or ground personnel, which meant the cockpit-voice recorder data was not retrieved. But the flight-data recorder captured the dynamics of the event as the aircraft (LZ-LDM) arrived from Catania on 16 July 2018. Some 90s before arrival it had been fully configured and stable on the ILS glideslope for runway 20, according to the Bulgarian ministry of transport's aircraft accidents investigation unit. At about 470ft above ground the first officer, who was flying, disengaged the autopilot, leaving the autothrottle active with a speed setting of 140kt. But he was unable to maintain the heading and glideslope because the aircraft was subjected to strong wind gusts and heavy rain. The jet started to deviate to the left and descend below the glidepath, prompting the captain to take control. Despite the aircraft's straying outside of the stable approach criteria, including falling “significantly under” the glidepath, the captain did not order a go-around. The autothrottle was disengaged at 85ft above ground and at 59ft the captain raised the aircraft's pitch from 4° to 11° – without increasing engine power. It descended to around 40ft while still 480m from the runway threshold and flew horizontally at this height for 10s while its airspeed fell from 136kt to 128kt. The aircraft crossed the threshold, right of the centreline, and the “extremely concerned” first officer suggested a go-around, says the inquiry. After the jet had travelled 350m, still at low height, along the runway, the captain ordered a go-around and increased the aircraft's pitch, while the first officer retracted the flaps from 40° to 11°, raised the landing-gear, and selected an airspeed of 180kt. But neither crew member realised that the thrust levers had been left close to idle and that, after the autothrottle had been disengaged, the jet operated for 29s without the thrust required for a go-around. The airspeed bled away to just 116kt as the aircraft' pitch increased to 15° – its lift hampered by the flap retraction – and only when the first officer was disarming the spoilers did he notice the thrust levers had not been advanced. Flight-data recorder information shows the thrust levers were aggressively pushed forward as the aircraft was still labouring at 71ft and 119kt. Three seconds later the pitch reached its maximum of just under 20° while the aircraft's angle of attack reached 38.6°. The aircraft travelled 1.68km without sufficient thrust – close to critical angles of attack and stall speeds – at heights varying from 33-107ft before go-around power was applied. Once the engine thrust increased, and the aircraft moved comfortably back into the flight envelope, the crew diverted to Toulouse. It touched down on Toulouse's runway 32L about half an hour after the incident. None of the 136 passengers and six crew members was injured. But the captain “did not report what happened” to the airline's management, or the maintenance staff, immediately after landing which meant the cockpit-voice recorder could not be downloaded and examined to clarify the situation on the flightdeck, says the inquiry. Its analysis points out that the thrust levers had been left above the idle position before the autothrottle was disengaged, and that this was a reason that the flight “did not end fatally”. Although the wing almost reached its limit in terms of generating lift, this limit was not passed, and the crew's realisation “at the last moment” that the MD-82 did not have enough thrust meant an accident was averted.

"All Nippon Airways' parent company has decided to undertake a fresh round of debt financing from the Development Bank of Japan, amounting to Y350 billion ($3.3 billion). The agreement is subject to a 29 June borrowing deadline and the debt financing will be repaid over the long term, “determined by negotiation with the lender”, ANA Holdings said in a 28 May statement. This is based on the company's financing plan for the current financial year ending 31 March 2021, approved at a 28 April board meeting. ANA says: “Though the consolidated forecast of the company for [the financial year ending 31 March 2022] is yet to be determined at the present time while it is unknown when the outbreak of coronavirus will end, the impact of this financing on the business results for the current year is expected to be minor.” In the recently concluded financial year, the company carried on its balance sheet Y843 billion of interest-bearing debt, which has a 6.5-year repayment period against operating cash flows.

"The US Air Force (USAF) is moving forward with an experiment to drop cruise missiles from the back ramp of cargo aircraft. The Air Force Research Laboratory and Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) successfully tested releasing mock cruise missiles on 28 January 2020 from the rear cargo ramp of a Lockheed Martin MC-130J Commando II, the service said on 27 May. Dropping cruise missiles from cargo aircraft is considered a cheaper alternative to designing a clean-sheet bomber. USAF leaders have recently discussed the possibility of developing an “Arsenal Plane”, a new bomber which would carry large numbers of cruise missiles into combat. As part of the January experiment, munitions were stacked on wooden pallets, called Combat Expendable Platforms, and rolled off the back of the MC-130J. “AFSOC aircrew released five [Combat Expendable Platforms] rigged with six simulated munitions, the same mass as the actual weapons, including four Cargo Launch Expendable Air Vehicles with Extended Range (CLEAVERs) across a spectrum of low and high altitude airdrops,” says the USAF. “These long-range, high precision weapons destroy moving and non-moving targets.” The Phase 1 demonstrations were conducted during three airdrops at Dugway Proving Ground, Utah. CLEAVER is an experimental cruise missile. The USAF envisions cargo aircraft, such as the C-130 or Boeing C-17 carrying the weapons to the edge of the air battle, and then dropping and firing them deep into enemy territory. The weapons would be networked with each other and other aircraft. The missiles would be semi-autonomous, and accompany unmanned air vehicles and fighters on combat missions, the service says. The USAF wants the missiles to swarm and overwhelm a target. In particular, long-range cruise missiles are seen as a means of destroying military targets while their release aircraft remain beyond the reach of China and Russia's anti-aircraft missile batteries. In future demonstrations, AFSOC plans to test different variants of CLEAVER, including glider and powered types, as well as fully functional missiles with warheads and terminal guidance systems, it says.",5,121,1.0,0.5845,"test, force, helicopter, fire, system, service, attack, design, usaf, missile","['u', 'force', 'usaf', 'move', 'forward', 'experiment', 'drop', 'cruise', 'missile', 'back', 'ramp', 'cargo', 'force', 'research', 'laboratory', 'force', 'special', 'operation', 'command', 'afsoc', 'successfully', 'test', 'release', 'mock', 'cruise', 'missile', 'january', 'rear', 'cargo', 'ramp', 'lockheed', 'martin', 'commando', 'ii', 'service', 'say', 'may', 'drop', 'cruise', 'missile', 'cargo', 'consider', 'cheaper', 'alternative', 'design', 'cleansheet', 'bomber', 'usaf', 'leader', 'recently', 'discuss', 'possibility', 'develop', 'arsenal', 'plane', 'bomber', 'carry', 'large', 'number', 'cruise', 'missile', 'combat', 'part', 'january', 'experiment', 'munition', 'stack', 'wooden', 'pallet', 'call', 'combat', 'expendable', 'platform', 'roll', 'back', 'afsoc', 'aircrew', 'release', 'combat', 'expendable', 'platform', 'rig', 'simulated', 'munition', 'mass', 'actual', 'weapon', 'include', 'cargo', 'launch', 'expendable', 'vehicle', 'extend', 'range', 'cleaver', 'across', 'spectrum', 'low', 'high', 'altitude', 'airdrop', 'say', 'usaf', 'longrange', 'high', 'precision', 'weapon', 'destroy', 'move', 'nonmoving', 'phase', 'demonstration', 'conduct', 'airdrop', 'dugway', 'prove', 'ground', 'utah', 'cleaver', 'experimental', 'cruise', 'missile', 'usaf', 'envisions', 'cargo', 'carry', 'weapon', 'edge', 'battle', 'drop', 'fire', 'deep', 'enemy', 'territory', 'weapon', 'networked', 'missile', 'semiautonomous', 'accompany', 'unmanned', 'vehicle', 'fighter', 'combat', 'mission', 'service', 'say', 'usaf', 'want', 'missile', 'swarm', 'overwhelm', 'target', 'particular', 'longrange', 'cruise', 'missile', 'see', 'mean', 'destroy', 'military', 'target', 'release', 'remain', 'beyond', 'reach', 'russia', 'antiaircraft', 'missile', 'battery', 'future', 'demonstration', 'afsoc', 'plan', 'test', 'different', 'variant', 'cleaver', 'include', 'glider', 'power', 'type', 'well', 'fully', 'functional', 'missile', 'warhead', 'terminal', 'guidance', 'system', 'say']"

"SAS has agreed with Airbus to delay delivery of four A320neos and is in talks with the airframer on further deferrals as the Scandinavian carrier prepares for a slow recovery in traffic after the coronavirus crisis. Chief financial officer Torbjorn Wist said during a second-quarter results briefing today that “so far” negotiations with Airbus had resulted in the deferral of four A320neos from 2022 to 2024. “We continue our discussion on additional solutions,” he says. Cirium fleets data shows that SAS has 40 A320neo-family jets on order – including three A321LRs – and holds options on a further 16. Additionally, the Scandinavian carrier has five A350-900s on order and hold six options. Chief executive Rickard Gustafson said during the briefing that SAS intended to delay “some” deliveries and accelerate the retirement of older aircraft in an effort to reduce the fleet size to match a lower-demand environment. “We might be able to reach a one-type fleet faster than previously anticipated before the crisis,” he says. SAS had already decided to phase out its remaining Boeing 737s and older A320-family jets in order to concentrate its narrowbody operation around the A320neo series. Earlier this year, Willis Lease Finance disclosed a deal with SAS under which the US engine lessor would manage the decommissioning process for the engines powering the carrier's 737s, to be phased out by 2024. In addition to the 737-700/800s,SAS's fleet includes A319ceos, A320ceos/neos, A321ceos, A330-300s, A340-300s and A350-900s. As part of an operational ramp-up plan, the carrier intends double its active fleet from 15 to 30 aircraft by mid-June, Gustafson says. The airline is currently operating A320neos on domestic routes in Norway and Sweden. The narrowbodies will initially be used for additional domestic services and then gradually deployed on selected European routes, while long-haul flights will “primarily” be operated with A330s and A350s, Gustavson says. In addition to the mainline activity, SAS has operated Bombardier CRJ900 regional jets and ATR 72 turboprops under wet-lease agreements. The airline is currently conducting turboprop services on Danish domestic routes, and Gustafson foresees scope for additional services and a return of regional jets. He says SAS has renegotiated “a lot” of contracts with its wet-lease partners in the wake of the coronavirus crisis. Gustafson expresses confidence that traffic demand will recover, but expects it will take “rather a long time” given the prospect of economic recession, passengers' health concerns, and the different timescales under which countries will lift travel restriction. “The world will not open up in a synchronised manner,” notes Gustafson. He thinksSASwill not face a “new normal” before 2022 and that demand will still be lower then than before the crisis.",5,124,4.0,0.2171,"airport, fleet, service, data, carrier, operation, passenger, number, operate, operator","['sa', 'agree', 'delay', 'delivery', 'talk', 'airframer', 'far', 'deferral', 'scandinavian', 'carrier', 'prepares', 'slow', 'recovery', 'traffic', 'coronavirus', 'crisis', 'chief', 'financial', 'officer', 'torbjorn', 'wist', 'say', 'secondquarter', 'result', 'briefing', 'today', 'far', 'negotiation', 'result', 'deferral', 'continue', 'discussion', 'additional', 'solution', 'say', 'fleet', 'data', 'sa', 'jet', 'order', 'include', 'hold', 'option', 'far', 'additionally', 'scandinavian', 'carrier', 'order', 'hold', 'option', 'chief', 'executive', 'rickard', 'gustafson', 'say', 'briefing', 'sa', 'intend', 'delay', 'delivery', 'accelerate', 'retirement', 'old', 'effort', 'reduce', 'fleet', 'size', 'match', 'lowerdemand', 'environment', 'might', 'able', 'reach', 'onetype', 'fleet', 'faster', 'previously', 'anticipate', 'crisis', 'say', 'sa', 'already', 'decide', 'phase', 'remain', 'old', 'jet', 'order', 'concentrate', 'narrowbody', 'operation', 'around', 'series', 'earlier', 'willis', 'lease', 'finance', 'disclose', 'deal', 'sa', 'u', 'engine', 'lessor', 'manage', 'decommission', 'process', 'engine', 'power', 'carrier', 'phase', 'addition', 'sa', 'fleet', 'include', 'part', 'operational', 'rampup', 'plan', 'carrier', 'intend', 'double', 'active', 'fleet', 'midjune', 'gustafson', 'say', 'currently', 'operating', 'domestic', 'route', 'norway', 'sweden', 'narrowbodies', 'initially', 'use', 'additional', 'domestic', 'service', 'gradually', 'deployed', 'select', 'european', 'route', 'longhaul', 'primarily', 'operate', 'gustavson', 'say', 'addition', 'mainline', 'activity', 'sa', 'operate', 'bombardier', 'regional', 'jet', 'atr', 'turboprop', 'wetlease', 'agreement', 'currently', 'conduct', 'turboprop', 'service', 'danish', 'domestic', 'route', 'gustafson', 'foresees', 'scope', 'additional', 'service', 'return', 'regional', 'jet', 'say', 'sa', 'renegotiate', 'lot', 'contract', 'wetlease', 'partner', 'wake', 'coronavirus', 'crisis', 'gustafson', 'express', 'confidence', 'traffic', 'demand', 'recover', 'expect', 'take', 'rather', 'long', 'give', 'prospect', 'economic', 'recession', 'passenger', 'health', 'concern', 'different', 'timescales', 'country', 'lift', 'travel', 'restriction', 'world', 'open', 'synchronise', 'manner', 'note', 'gustafson', 'thinkssaswill', 'face', 'normal', 'demand', 'still', 'low', 'crisis']"
"Norwegian's first-quarter losses have widened significantly to NKr3.28 billion ($331 million) and the company remains in “hibernation mode”, in the hope that its recent financial restructuring and state-aid lifeline will enable it to have a future. Having been forced to convert NKr12.7 billion of debt into equity to access vital government funding – a move that has put creditors firmly in charge of its destiny – the Scandinavian budget carrier aims to gradually “re-emerge” in a slimmed-down form from the second quarter of 2021. Norwegian says it took “drastic measures to preserve liquidity” as the coronavirus pandemic took hold. Just seven of the 147 aircraft it had at the end of March remain in operation, 80% of its staff have been temporarily laid off, and more than 4,000 pilots and flight attendants were axed when the airline's four crew subsidiaries in Denmark and Sweden filed for bankruptcy in April. The carrier reported on 28 May that its pre-tax loss for the first quarter of 2020 had worsened by 66% compared with the same period last year. Norwegian's operating loss widened by 43% to NKr2.08 billion and revenue dropped 19% to NKr6.51 billion. The airline's ASK capacity was cut by 35% and passenger numbers declined 37%. “The coming months will be challenging for Norwegian and the industry, but our goal is to ensure tha tNorwegian has a strong position in the future airline industry with a clear direction and strategy,” states the airline's chief executive Jacob Schram. “As soon as the world returns to normalcy, we will be prepared to return with improved service to our customers.” But the carrier acknowledges that the long-term impact of Covid-19 on its operation is “highly uncertain” and dependent on various factors. “The situation is evolving rapidly, and it is unclear how the virus will continue to develop or when the airline industry, and thus the company, will see a recovery to baseline levels,” says Norwegian. Bernstein analyst Daniel Roeska describes Norwegian's first-quarter financial results as “worryingly opaque”. He expresses concern that its net debt was NKr5 billion greater than a year ago, “as cash continues to flow out of the business”. The carrier's net debt as of 31 March stood at NKr66 billion, since which time it has converted NKr12.7 billion of debt into equity and secured a NKr 3 billion state-guaranteed loan package from the Norwegian government. “With no cash-flow statement or balance sheet at Q1 (we normally get one), and no information about the rate of cash burn (unlike other airlines), the worry must be that this would paint a bleak picture of liquidity, and we would not be surprised if current resources could run out at some point during Q3,” writes Roeska in a research note.",5,125,9.0,0.2041,"industry, crisis, demand, coronavirus, global, iata, market, level, cargo, expect","['norwegian', 'firstquarter', 'loss', 'widen', 'significantly', 'remains', 'hibernation', 'mode', 'hope', 'recent', 'financial', 'restructuring', 'stateaid', 'lifeline', 'enable', 'future', 'force', 'convert', 'debt', 'equity', 'access', 'vital', 'government', 'funding', 'move', 'put', 'creditor', 'firmly', 'charge', 'destiny', 'scandinavian', 'budget', 'carrier', 'aim', 'gradually', 'reemerge', 'slimmeddown', 'form', 'second', 'quarter', 'norwegian', 'say', 'take', 'drastic', 'measure', 'preserve', 'liquidity', 'coronavirus', 'pandemic', 'take', 'hold', 'end', 'march', 'remain', 'operation', 'staff', 'temporarily', 'laid', 'pilot', 'attendant', 'axed', 'crew', 'subsidiary', 'denmark', 'sweden', 'file', 'bankruptcy', 'april', 'carrier', 'report', 'may', 'pretax', 'loss', 'quarter', 'worsen', 'compare', 'period', 'norwegian', 'operating', 'loss', 'widen', 'revenue', 'drop', 'ask', 'capacity', 'cut', 'passenger', 'number', 'decline', 'come', 'month', 'challenge', 'norwegian', 'industry', 'goal', 'ensure', 'tha', 'tnorwegian', 'strong', 'position', 'future', 'industry', 'clear', 'direction', 'strategy', 'state', 'chief', 'executive', 'jacob', 'schram', 'soon', 'world', 'return', 'normalcy', 'prepared', 'return', 'improve', 'service', 'carrier', 'acknowledges', 'longterm', 'impact', 'coronavirus', 'operation', 'highly', 'uncertain', 'dependent', 'various', 'factor', 'situation', 'evolve', 'rapidly', 'unclear', 'virus', 'continue', 'develop', 'industry', 'thus', 'see', 'recovery', 'baseline', 'level', 'say', 'norwegian', 'bernstein', 'analyst', 'daniel', 'roeska', 'describes', 'norwegian', 'firstquarter', 'financial', 'result', 'worryingly', 'opaque', 'express', 'concern', 'net', 'debt', 'great', 'ago', 'cash', 'continue', 'flow', 'business', 'carrier', 'net', 'debt', 'march', 'stood', 'since', 'convert', 'debt', 'equity', 'secure', 'nkr', 'stateguaranteed', 'loan', 'package', 'norwegian', 'government', 'cashflow', 'statement', 'balance', 'sheet', 'normally', 'get', 'information', 'rate', 'cash', 'burn', 'unlike', 'worry', 'must', 'paint', 'bleak', 'picture', 'liquidity', 'surprised', 'current', 'resource', 'run', 'point', 'writes', 'roeska', 'research', 'note']"
"Avation is ending its formal sale process as the Covid-19 pandemic brings unprecedented disruption to the aviation industry that is still ongoing.

In light of that, the company's board has concluded that “at present, a formal sale process is unlikely to produce an outcome that accurately reflects the long-term value of the company and at a value that is attractive to shareholders.” “The board is also mindful of the distraction posed to its day to day operational activities by a protracted formal sale process. Consequently, the board has decided to terminate the strategic review and formal sale process and confirms that it is no longer in active discussions with any interested parties.” Avation says it will continue to focus on “near-term execution and liquidity, including managing its capital structure as necessary”.

"Russia has started building its first stealth bomber, also known as the Perspective Aviation Complex for Long-Range Aviation (PAK DA) programme, according to state media. “Development of working design documentation is complete, material shipping has commenced,” according to a source in the “military-industrial complex”, says Russian government-controlled news agency TASS on 26 May. Commons Red Square in Moscow Production of the PAK DA airframe is to be handled by United Aircraft, while the aircraft was designed by the Tupolev design bureau. TASS says a source told it that construction of the aircraft's cockpit has also begun. “The final assembly of the entire machine should be complete in 2021,” its source adds. The addition of a stealth bomber would strengthen Russia's nuclear triad. The nuclear triad is a strategy employed by Washington and Moscow that gives each country three options for launching nuclear attacks: aircraft, submarines and ballistic missiles. While Russia has aircraft capable of launching nuclear-tipped cruise missiles, the country lacks a stealth bomber. The USA has a fleet of 20 Northrop Grumman B-2s. The type is a flying wing design: an airframe shape that makes it more difficult to detect on radar. The aircraft also sports a radar-absorbent coating. Russia appears to be going with a similar airframe design, though publicly available renderings of the stealth bomber are difficult to verify. “It is known that the PAK DA is designed using the flying wing scheme. The machine will feature technologies and materials that reduce its radar visibility (stealth technology),” says TASS. “The plane will be subsonic, and will be able to carry current and future cruise missiles, precision bombs and hypersonic weapons, it will be provided with the newest communications and jamming equipment.” China is also building a long-range stealth bomber, the Xian H-20.",5,127,1.0,0.5097,"test, force, helicopter, fire, system, service, attack, design, usaf, missile","['russia', 'start', 'building', 'stealth', 'bomber', 'know', 'perspective', 'complex', 'longrange', 'pak', 'da', 'programme', 'accord', 'state', 'medium', 'development', 'work', 'design', 'documentation', 'complete', 'material', 'shipping', 'commenced', 'accord', 'source', 'militaryindustrial', 'complex', 'say', 'russian', 'governmentcontrolled', 'news', 'agency', 'ta', 'may', 'common', 'red', 'square', 'moscow', 'production', 'pak', 'da', 'airframe', 'handle', 'united', 'design', 'tupolev', 'design', 'bureau', 'ta', 'say', 'source', 'told', 'construction', 'cockpit', 'begin', 'final', 'assembly', 'entire', 'machine', 'complete', 'source', 'add', 'addition', 'stealth', 'bomber', 'strengthen', 'russia', 'nuclear', 'triad', 'nuclear', 'triad', 'strategy', 'employ', 'washington', 'moscow', 'give', 'country', 'option', 'launch', 'nuclear', 'attack', 'submarine', 'ballistic', 'missile', 'russia', 'capable', 'launch', 'nucleartipped', 'cruise', 'missile', 'country', 'lack', 'stealth', 'bomber', 'usa', 'fleet', 'northrop', 'grumman', 'type', 'fly', 'wing', 'design', 'airframe', 'shape', 'make', 'difficult', 'detect', 'radar', 'sport', 'radarabsorbent', 'coat', 'russia', 'appear', 'go', 'similar', 'airframe', 'design', 'though', 'publicly', 'available', 'rendering', 'stealth', 'bomber', 'difficult', 'verify', 'know', 'pak', 'da', 'design', 'use', 'fly', 'wing', 'scheme', 'machine', 'feature', 'technology', 'material', 'reduce', 'radar', 'visibility', 'stealth', 'technology', 'say', 'ta', 'plane', 'subsonic', 'able', 'carry', 'current', 'future', 'cruise', 'missile', 'precision', 'bomb', 'hypersonic', 'weapon', 'provide', 'communication', 'jamming', 'building', 'longrange', 'stealth', 'bomber', 'xian']"
"Mitsubishi Aircraft's decision to suspend SpaceJet M100 development comes amid fresh questions about the future of “scope clauses” – those pilot contract provisions that dictate which aircraft US regional airlines can operate. Found in contracts between major US airlines and their pilot unions, scope clauses generally prohibit those carriers' regional partners from operating aircraft with maximum take-off weights (MTOW) exceeding 86,000lb (39,000kg). Until recently, market conditions suggested scope clauses would remain unchanged for years, in which case Mitsubishi Aircraft would need the lighter-weight 76-seat M100 for the US market. But the downturn could conceivably give airline managers leverage needed to renegotiate scope clauses, say analysts. If that happens, US regional carriers might be able to operate Mitsubishi Aircraft's M90, a higher-weight 88-seater already in flight testing. Such a development would also bode well for Embraer's E175-E2, which, like the M90, exceeds the 86,000lb cap. “In less than two months we are in a completely reversed situation, where it is the airline management in the driver's seat,” says Michele Merluzeau of aerospace consultancy AIR. “Maybe Mitsubishi is better off seeing how this issue of scope clause evolves over time...because the M90 might be just fine in the future.” Ascend by Cirium's head of valuations George Dimitroff says scope clause changes are far from certain. But factors like a prolonged airline-industry downturn, bankruptcy filings and pilot lay-offs would make contract revisions more conceivable, he says. But Dimitroff doubts any changes would occur sooner than next year. “I think [Mitsubishi Aircraft] may be having a bit of a strategy dilemma,” Dimitroff says, “Everything is really hanging on the scope clauses.” American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines have scope clauses written into their contracts with pilots. Pilot unions see the provisions as protections that keep airlines from farming out the flying of larger jets to lower-cost affiliates.  A rendering of Mitsubishi Aircraft's SpaceJet. Mitsubishi Aircraft is already well into flight testing the M90. But at the 2019 Paris air show it launched the M100, an aircraft that, with an 86,000lb MTOW, would be tailored to the US market. Mitsubishi Aircraft had intended to begin M100 deliveries in 2024. But on 22 May, Mitsubishi Aircraft said it was shelving M100 development and closing on non-Japan sites. The company is bringing all work back to Japan, where it intends to continue M90 flight testing. That testing had been underway both in Nagoya, Japan and in the USA, at Moses Lake, Washington. That news came several weeks after parent Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) announced it was reviewing the M100 programme and cutting the SpaceJet's budget by half, to Y60 billion ($557 million) in fiscal year 2020. Mitsubishi Aircraft declines to comment about whether scope clauses influenced those decisions. Its most-recent projection was to deliver the first M90 in FY2021, which starts in April 2021, or later. Analysts express confidence that Mitsubishi Aircraft will see the M90 through to certification. They feel the programme has cost too much and is too close to certification to be shuttered. Dimitroff warns Mitsubishi Aircraft can only pause M100 development for so long. The SpaceJet programme is already years behind schedule and the M100 remains in early development stages. At some point, the M100's technology will become dated. Merluzeau suspects Mitsubishi Aircraft's decision to slow the SpaceJet reflects factors other than the scope clause. Those include the collapse of new-aircraft demand and the cheap price of fuel, which erodes the efficiency benefits of next-generation jets. He also notes that the downturn will affect MHI's other aerospace businesses. The company manufactures major components for all of Boeing's commercial products. Boeing has already responded to the downturn by planning major production cuts. It intends to slash 787 production from 14 to seven aircraft monthly by 2022, cut 777/777X output to three from five aircraft monthly in 2021 and produce only 31 737 Max in 2021, down from a pre-grounding rate of 52 aircraft monthly. SpaceJet's struggles to gain traction in the USA also reflect the difficulty of penetrating the ultra-competitive, ultra-cost-conscious US regional aircraft market, Merluzeau adds. US regional airlines operate on “razor thin profits” and have long experience flying E175s and Bombardier CRJs, making them particularly cautious to bet on new aircraft types. “I think the Covid crisis has accelerated the realisation in Japan that the...US market is going to be a tougher challenge,” he says. “It's been a painful journey for Mitsubishi.”",5,128,0.0,0.4502,"order, business, jet, delivery, production, customer, deliver, commercial, quarter, include","['mitsubishi', 'decision', 'suspend', 'spacejet', 'development', 'come', 'amid', 'fresh', 'question', 'future', 'scope', 'clause', 'pilot', 'contract', 'provision', 'dictate', 'u', 'regional', 'operate', 'found', 'contract', 'major', 'u', 'pilot', 'union', 'scope', 'clause', 'generally', 'prohibit', 'carrier', 'regional', 'partner', 'operating', 'maximum', 'takeoff', 'weight', 'mtow', 'exceed', 'recently', 'market', 'condition', 'suggest', 'scope', 'clause', 'remain', 'unchanged', 'case', 'mitsubishi', 'need', 'lighterweight', 'u', 'market', 'downturn', 'conceivably', 'give', 'manager', 'leverage', 'need', 'renegotiate', 'scope', 'clause', 'say', 'analyst', 'happens', 'u', 'regional', 'carrier', 'might', 'able', 'operate', 'mitsubishi', 'higherweight', 'already', 'test', 'development', 'bode', 'well', 'embraer', 'like', 'exceeds', 'cap', 'less', 'month', 'completely', 'reverse', 'situation', 'management', 'driver', 'seat', 'say', 'michele', 'merluzeau', 'consultancy', 'maybe', 'mitsubishi', 'well', 'see', 'issue', 'scope', 'clause', 'evolves', 'might', 'fine', 'ascend', 'head', 'valuation', 'george', 'dimitroff', 'say', 'scope', 'clause', 'change', 'far', 'certain', 'factor', 'like', 'prolong', 'airlineindustry', 'downturn', 'bankruptcy', 'filing', 'pilot', 'layoff', 'make', 'contract', 'revision', 'conceivable', 'say', 'dimitroff', 'doubt', 'change', 'occur', 'sooner', 'next', 'think', 'mitsubishi', 'may', 'bit', 'strategy', 'dilemma', 'dimitroff', 'say', 'everything', 'really', 'hang', 'scope', 'american', 'delta', 'line', 'united', 'scope', 'clause', 'write', 'contract', 'pilot', 'pilot', 'union', 'see', 'provision', 'protection', 'keep', 'farm', 'fly', 'large', 'jet', 'lowercost', 'affiliate', 'render', 'mitsubishi', 'spacejet', 'mitsubishi', 'already', 'well', 'test', 'paris', 'launch', 'mtow', 'tailor', 'u', 'market', 'mitsubishi', 'intend', 'begin', 'delivery', 'may', 'mitsubishi', 'say', 'shelve', 'development', 'closing', 'nonjapan', 'site', 'bring', 'work', 'back', 'japan', 'intend', 'continue', 'test', 'test', 'underway', 'nagoya', 'japan', 'usa', 'moses', 'lake', 'washington', 'news', 'come', 'several', 'week', 'parent', 'mitsubishi', 'heavy', 'industry', 'mhi', 'announce', 'review', 'programme', 'cut', 'spacejet', 'budget', 'half', 'fiscal', 'mitsubishi', 'decline', 'comment', 'whether', 'scope', 'clause', 'influence', 'decision', 'mostrecent', 'projection', 'deliver', 'start', 'april', 'later', 'analyst', 'express', 'confidence', 'mitsubishi', 'see', 'certification', 'feel', 'programme', 'cost', 'much', 'close', 'certification', 'shutter', 'dimitroff', 'warns', 'mitsubishi', 'pause', 'development', 'long', 'spacejet', 'programme', 'already', 'behind', 'schedule', 'remains', 'early', 'development', 'stage', 'point', 'technology', 'become', 'date', 'merluzeau', 'suspect', 'mitsubishi', 'decision', 'slow', 'spacejet', 'reflect', 'factor', 'scope', 'clause', 'include', 'collapse', 'newaircraft', 'demand', 'cheap', 'price', 'fuel', 'erodes', 'efficiency', 'benefit', 'nextgeneration', 'jet', 'note', 'downturn', 'affect', 'mhi', 'business', 'manufacture', 'major', 'component', 'commercial', 'product', 'already', 'respond', 'downturn', 'planning', 'major', 'production', 'cut', 'intend', 'slash', 'production', 'monthly', 'cut', 'output', 'monthly', 'produce', 'pregrounding', 'rate', 'monthly', 'spacejet', 'struggle', 'gain', 'traction', 'usa', 'reflect', 'difficulty', 'penetrate', 'ultracompetitive', 'ultracostconscious', 'u', 'regional', 'market', 'merluzeau', 'add', 'u', 'regional', 'operate', 'razor', 'thin', 'profit', 'long', 'experience', 'fly', 'bombardier', 'crjs', 'make', 'particularly', 'cautious', 'bet', 'type', 'think', 'covid', 'crisis', 'accelerate', 'realisation', 'japan', 'u', 'market', 'go', 'tougher', 'challenge', 'say', 'painful', 'journey', 'mitsubishi']"
"South African Airways' plan to restart domestic flights in mid-June has been called into question by its rescuers, who have criticised the airline for releasing an “unvetted” public statement that created an “unfair expectation” among stakeholders. The struggling state-owned carrier said in a 26 May statement that it “looks forward to resuming domestic services” from mid-June.  “Everyone at SAA is looking forward to welcoming and serving our customers once again,” stated the airline's chief commercial officer, Philip Saunders. “Our operational preparedness is underlined by the significant role the airline has played in global repatriations to and from South Africa and by our desire to serve the domestic market.” However, SAA's business-rescue practitioner Matuson Associates says the airline made the service-resumption suggestion “incorrectly”. Matuson adds that SAA's statement was released “in violation” of the rescue practitioners' communications protocol, and deems it “unfortunate that the unvetted press statement created an unfair expectation on our relevant stakeholders, including SAA's customers as well as employees, who are on unpaid absence as a result of the travel ban which led to the halting of the company's operations and compounded its financial distress”. The cessation of flights “remains as is until SAA has a better sense of what the Level 3 lockdown means in terms of domestic air travel”, Matuson stresses, noting that the airline “also needs to consider what the opening of the skies will mean from a commercial and load-factor perspective”. Earlier this month, SAA's rescuers were instructed by the standing committee on public accounts to produce a formal business plan for airline within 25 days, after a parliamentary standing committee expressed dissatisfaction with a draft publication. Matuson acknowledged the committee's remarks and promised to “accelerate production of the business rescue plan”. The flag carrier has been undergoing a business rescue process since December last year. On 20 May, South Africa's government announced that it had provisionally set aside R3.8 billion ($217 million) for the airline.",5,129,8.0,0.3439,"government, uk, carrier, business, state, share, south, airway, financial, plan","['south', 'african', 'airway', 'plan', 'restart', 'domestic', 'midjune', 'call', 'question', 'rescuer', 'criticise', 'release', 'unvetted', 'public', 'statement', 'create', 'unfair', 'expectation', 'among', 'stakeholder', 'struggle', 'stateowned', 'carrier', 'say', 'may', 'statement', 'look', 'forward', 'resume', 'domestic', 'service', 'midjune', 'everyone', 'saa', 'look', 'forward', 'welcome', 'serve', 'customer', 'state', 'chief', 'commercial', 'officer', 'philip', 'saunders', 'operational', 'preparedness', 'underlined', 'significant', 'role', 'played', 'global', 'repatriation', 'south', 'africa', 'desire', 'serve', 'domestic', 'however', 'saa', 'businessrescue', 'practitioner', 'matuson', 'associate', 'say', 'make', 'serviceresumption', 'suggestion', 'incorrectly', 'matuson', 'add', 'saa', 'statement', 'release', 'violation', 'rescue', 'practitioner', 'communication', 'protocol', 'deems', 'unfortunate', 'unvetted', 'press', 'statement', 'create', 'unfair', 'expectation', 'relevant', 'stakeholder', 'include', 'saa', 'customer', 'well', 'employee', 'unpaid', 'absence', 'result', 'travel', 'ban', 'lead', 'halt', 'operation', 'compound', 'financial', 'distress', 'cessation', 'remains', 'saa', 'well', 'sense', 'level', 'lockdown', 'mean', 'term', 'domestic', 'travel', 'matuson', 'stress', 'note', 'need', 'consider', 'opening', 'sky', 'mean', 'commercial', 'loadfactor', 'perspective', 'earlier', 'month', 'saa', 'rescuer', 'instruct', 'stand', 'committee', 'public', 'account', 'produce', 'formal', 'business', 'plan', 'within', 'day', 'parliamentary', 'stand', 'committee', 'express', 'dissatisfaction', 'draft', 'publication', 'matuson', 'acknowledge', 'committee', 'remark', 'promise', 'accelerate', 'production', 'business', 'rescue', 'plan', 'flag', 'carrier', 'undergo', 'business', 'rescue', 'process', 'since', 'december', 'may', 'south', 'africa', 'government', 'announce', 'provisionally', 'set', 'aside']"
"LATAM Airlines Group has identified 19 leased aircraft which it will cut from its operators' fleets, following the company's filing for US Chapter 11 creditor protection. Six long-haul jets – comprising two Airbus A350-900s and four Boeing 787-9s – are among the aircraft listed in the filing. The remainder is made up of various Airbus single-aisle types. Ten of the jets are Chilean-registered, the other nine are Brazilian. LATAM's filing states that the debtors' fleet totals 320 aircraft of which 213 are under finance leases, another 98 are under operating leases, and nine are unencumbered. It adds that it has been “undertaking a review” of the fleet to account for the current air transport crisis as well as future demand. LATAM has already decided, however, that it has a number of “excess aircraft” which are “no longer accretive” to its business, adding that maintaining these unnecessary aircraft leases would impose significant insurance and servicing costs. “As such, the debtors are seeking to reject and shed those onerous [lease] agreements,” its filing states. It has requested rejection of the leases from 26 May, with the exception of the four 787-9s for which LATAM is seeking rejection from 3 June. While most of the aircraft have co-located engines, a number of airframes have powerplants which are undergoing work in maintenance facilities – such as Rolls-Royce's centres in Hong Kong, Derby and Singapore for some of the A350s and 787s, while an A319 is listed as having one engine at Israel's IAI and the other with Lufthansa Technik in Tulsa.

"Hainan Airlnes will reduce its stake in its MRO unit and divest its training unit to other HNA Group companies as it seeks to intensify its focus on the core passenger and cargo business. Hainan will reduce its stake in MRO unit HNA Technic to about 68%, with the remaining shareholding taken by an airport infrastructure company related to Hainan parent HNA Group. The transaction will see the Hainan Island Airport Industrial group pump CNY2.5 billion ($350 million) into the MRO unit, bringing the total registered capital of HNA Technic to about CNY3.7 billion. Hainan Island Airport Industrial group is part of the HNA Infrastructure group, itself part of the HNA Group, which owns Hainan Airlines. Hainan discloses that the transaction is useful for HNA Technic to build up its capital and reduce its asset-liability ratio, and is expected “to have a positive impact” on the MRO provider's future development. It adds that even with the shareholding change, it will still be the MRO's controlling shareholder. Separately, Hainan also disclosed that it will divesting flight training unit Hainan Tianyu Flight Training to sister company HNA Infrastructure, with the transaction valued at CNY7.41 billion. The move will allow the carrier to “focus on its core business” of passenger and cargo operations and “optimise resource allocation”. “The transaction...conforms to [Hainan's] current strategic positioning and will not have a significant adverse impact on the company's production and operation,” it adds. Hainan states that the two transactions are still pending internal and shareholder approvals. The carrier's latest move to reduce shareholding comes over a year after it unveiled plans to acquire the two units from parent HNA Group, which itself was facing its own financial woes.

"The Hong Kong Civil Aviation Department (CAD) is investigating a loss of separation incident at Hong Kong International airport, involving a FedEx Boeing MD-11 freighter and a Hong Kong Airlines (HKA) Airbus A330-300. The incident occurred on the evening of 22 May at the airport's Runway 25L. The FedEx MD-11F, registered N595FE, was on final approach, operating flight FX9741 from Anchorage. Meanwhile, the HKA Airbus was on its take-off run when the loss of separation incident happened. The aircraft, registered B-LNM, was operating flight HX765 to Bangkok. The CAD notes that there were no passengers on board the aircraft. As the FedEx freighter was approaching Runway 25L, it noticed the that the HKA A330 “had not fully departed from the runway”, and decided to execute a missed approach. “According to the preliminary information, when the FedEx freighter commenced the climb during the missed approach, the two aircraft were more than 1.7km (5,580ft) apart,” the CAD states. The CAD, which has classified this as a serious incident, says the FedEx aircraft subsequently repositioned itself for approach and landed without incident. No-one was injured, and operations at the airport were not affected. Cirium fleets data indicates the FedEx freighter was delivered to the carrier in 2002, having began its life as a passenger aircraft with American Airlines in 1993.

"The US Department of Defense (DoD) is not concerned that its in-development hypersonic missiles could suffer from a communications blackout caused by a cocoon of plasma. NASA spacecraft and intercontinental ballistic missiles have previously suffered from a communication interference caused by a layer of plasma forming around the vehicles when they re-enter the Earth's atmosphere. Plasma forms when atmospheric gases are ionized – electrons are separated from their atoms – by the heat and compression caused by an object moving through the air at many times the speed of sound. The plasma layer blocks radio transmissions. Many researchers and observers have thought that hypersonic missiles would also form a plasma sheath while flying more than five times the speed of sound through the atmosphere. That could make it difficult to communicate with the missiles. Radioing the high-stakes weapons could be critical, for instance, to abort a mission. However, despite popular perception, the possibility is not a major concern, says Mike White, assistant director of hypersonics with the Pentagon. “When we fly a missile for sustained hypersonic flight within the atmosphere, the plasma tends to not be so much of a problem,” he says. “We see plasma effects when we have relatively blunt bodies entering from space and the velocities they're very, very high, and the shockwaves are very, very strong, so that heats the air even more severely than what we experienced in sustained flight.” The DoD is developing two types of hypersonic missiles: boost-glide and air-breathing cruise missiles. The boost-glide variety is essentially a hypersonic glider mounted on top of a ballistic missile or booster rocket. After it is rocketed to a high altitude, the vehicle is separated from the booster and glides back to Earth at speeds up to Mach 20. Examples include the US Army and US Navy's jointly-developed Common Hypersonic Glide Body (C-HGB), as well as the US Air Force (USAF) and Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's (DARPA) jointly-developed Tactical Boost Glide weapon. The air-breathing cruise missile type of hypersonic weapon relies on a scramjet engine to propel itself through the atmosphere. A scramjet engine has no moving parts, but uses a booster rocket to ram air into a combustion chamber at supersonic speeds. There the air is mixed with fuel and ignited, producing enough thrust to propel a vehicle to hypersonic speeds. Scramjet missiles fly at lesser hypersonic speeds, but on a shallower flight path than a boost-glide hypersonic missile. One example includes DARPA and the USAF's Hypersonic Air-breathing Weapon Concept. The high altitude and high speed that comes with boost-glide hypersonic missiles has often caused observers to worry the weapon would develop a plasma sheath. Compared to the Space Shuttle or Apollo capsule, hypersonic boost-glide vehicles are designed to slip through the atmosphere without too much plasma build-up, however. “We designed the vehicle to be relatively streamlined and slender, and relatively aerodynamically efficient,” says White. The C-HGB, which was successfully test flown in 2011, 2017 and March 2020, has been able to communicate with ground stations, he says. “All of our flight test vehicles had telemetry; measuring things on the vehicle and sending that information to ground stations that are put in place along the trajectory to monitor and take that data,” says White.",5,133,1.0,0.6851,"test, force, helicopter, fire, system, service, attack, design, usaf, missile","['u', 'department', 'defense', 'dod', 'concerned', 'indevelopment', 'hypersonic', 'missile', 'suffer', 'communication', 'blackout', 'cause', 'cocoon', 'plasma', 'nasa', 'spacecraft', 'intercontinental', 'ballistic', 'missile', 'previously', 'suffer', 'communication', 'interference', 'cause', 'layer', 'plasma', 'form', 'around', 'vehicle', 'reenter', 'earth', 'atmosphere', 'plasma', 'form', 'atmospheric', 'gas', 'ionize', 'electron', 'separate', 'atom', 'heat', 'compression', 'cause', 'object', 'move', 'many', 'speed', 'sound', 'plasma', 'layer', 'block', 'radio', 'transmission', 'many', 'researcher', 'observer', 'thought', 'hypersonic', 'missile', 'form', 'plasma', 'sheath', 'fly', 'speed', 'sound', 'atmosphere', 'make', 'difficult', 'communicate', 'missile', 'radio', 'highstakes', 'weapon', 'critical', 'instance', 'abort', 'mission', 'however', 'despite', 'popular', 'perception', 'possibility', 'major', 'concern', 'say', 'mike', 'white', 'assistant', 'director', 'hypersonics', 'pentagon', 'fly', 'missile', 'sustain', 'hypersonic', 'within', 'atmosphere', 'plasma', 'tends', 'much', 'problem', 'say', 'see', 'plasma', 'effect', 'relatively', 'blunt', 'body', 'enter', 'space', 'velocity', 'high', 'shockwaves', 'strong', 'heat', 'even', 'severely', 'experienced', 'sustain', 'dod', 'develop', 'type', 'hypersonic', 'missile', 'boostglide', 'airbreathing', 'cruise', 'missile', 'boostglide', 'variety', 'essentially', 'hypersonic', 'glider', 'mount', 'top', 'ballistic', 'missile', 'booster', 'rocket', 'rocket', 'high', 'altitude', 'vehicle', 'separate', 'booster', 'glide', 'back', 'earth', 'speed', 'mach', 'example', 'include', 'u', 'army', 'u', 'navy', 'jointlydeveloped', 'common', 'hypersonic', 'glide', 'body', 'chgb', 'well', 'u', 'force', 'usaf', 'defense', 'advanced', 'research', 'project', 'agency', 'darpa', 'jointlydeveloped', 'tactical', 'boost', 'glide', 'weapon', 'airbreathing', 'cruise', 'missile', 'type', 'hypersonic', 'weapon', 'relies', 'scramjet', 'engine', 'propel', 'atmosphere', 'scramjet', 'engine', 'move', 'part', 'booster', 'rocket', 'ram', 'combustion', 'chamber', 'supersonic', 'speed', 'mixed', 'fuel', 'ignite', 'produce', 'enough', 'thrust', 'propel', 'vehicle', 'hypersonic', 'speed', 'scramjet', 'missile', 'fly', 'lesser', 'hypersonic', 'speed', 'shallower', 'path', 'boostglide', 'hypersonic', 'missile', 'example', 'include', 'darpa', 'usaf', 'hypersonic', 'airbreathing', 'weapon', 'concept', 'high', 'altitude', 'high', 'speed', 'come', 'boostglide', 'hypersonic', 'missile', 'often', 'cause', 'observer', 'worry', 'weapon', 'develop', 'plasma', 'sheath', 'compare', 'space', 'shuttle', 'apollo', 'capsule', 'hypersonic', 'boostglide', 'vehicle', 'design', 'slip', 'atmosphere', 'without', 'much', 'plasma', 'buildup', 'however', 'design', 'vehicle', 'relatively', 'streamline', 'slender', 'relatively', 'aerodynamically', 'efficient', 'say', 'white', 'chgb', 'successfully', 'test', 'flown', 'march', 'able', 'communicate', 'ground', 'station', 'say', 'test', 'vehicle', 'telemetry', 'measure', 'thing', 'vehicle', 'send', 'information', 'ground', 'station', 'put', 'place', 'along', 'trajectory', 'monitor', 'take', 'data', 'say', 'white']"
"IATA is warning that the increased debt levels being racked up by airlines to counter the revenue shortfall during the coronavirus grounding means a slower recovery and the potential for failures remain even though state interventions have been made. The airline association estimates collective industry debt levels could increase more than a quarter this year to around $550 billion, in part because more than half of the recent round of state funding support is in repayble forms. IATA released analysis today which showed governments have provided airlines $123 billion in financial support during the crisis so far. That government support has helped avert potentially more airline failures, particularly as IATA has previously flagged carriers typically had enough cash to survive for two months and the industry was burning through cash at a rate of $60 billion a quarter while effectively grounded. But while there have been some high profile carriers entering formal restructuring, including Latin America's biggest airline LATAM Airlines Group earlier today, there have been relatively few airline collapses since the crisis began. “We have seen some airline failures, but only a handful,” said IATA chief economist Brian Pearce, during a media conference today. He cites three key factors which have enabled airlines to survive the crisis. ”Airlines have been able to make that cash last longer through cutting some of their costs. Secondly, they have turned to banks and capital markets - or at least the stronger airlines have turned to private sector financial funding to raise more cash. Thirdly, we have seen substantial government support.” IATA notes $67 billion of the government support is in the form of state loans, guarantees and deferred taxes - all of which will need to be repaid. The largest chunk of the balance is almost $35 billion in wage subsidy schemes, while IATA estimates around $11.5 billion in equity financing. ”That's a lot of new debt that has been loaded onto the balance sheets of the airlines that are being supported,” says Pearce. IATA estimates at the end of last year the airline industry had about $430 billion of debt. The combination of government aid and commercial loans raised by airlines, contributes to an expected jump of about $120 billion in debt to $550 billion by the end of the year. ”The problem is we have only seen about $30 billion in new equity - either issues by airlines on the capital markets or the $11 billion equity injection provided by governments,” he says. Given the tough revenue environment for the rest of this and next year, generating cash-flow to service these debt will be challenging. ”So debt is going to be a very substantial burden on the industry as it moves into the recovery phase,” Pearce adds. “The consequences are we could easily see airline failures under the weight of this debt, or alternatively we could see more government involvement if there is the need to swap some of that debt for equity.” While government support during this crisis has been welcomed - and called for - by IATA, the association has flagged concerns about the uneven spread of this support. ”Although in total government support looks fairly substantial at $123 billion, it has been very unevenly spread and where governments haven't supported airlines, we have started to see airlines starting to get into difficulty. “A region like North America has seen aid equivalent to 25% of last year's revenues, very substantial support,” Pearce says, adding in Europe it is around 15% and Asia-Pacific it is 10%. ”But airlines in Latin America, Africa and the Middle East, have seen support of barely 1% of their operating revenues. So there is clearly an issue here with the lack of support for airlines in emerging markets, which is obviously a concern.” Pearce also notes that aid is not just being given to the stronger airlines. ”There is no clear correlation between good prior financial performance the extent of aid, ” he says. ”So you have countries which before the crisis had a very good financial performance [getting] little support. So there remains the possibility that we are going to see some future casualties in the industry of airlines that had business models that were very strong prior to the crisis.” IATA director general Alexandre de Juniac adds: ”Government aid is helping to keep the industry afloat. The next challenge will be preventing airlines from sinking under the burden of debt that the aid is creating.” ",5,134,9.0,0.4091,"industry, crisis, demand, coronavirus, global, iata, market, level, cargo, expect","['iata', 'warn', 'increase', 'debt', 'level', 'rack', 'counter', 'revenue', 'shortfall', 'coronavirus', 'ground', 'mean', 'slow', 'recovery', 'potential', 'failure', 'remain', 'even', 'though', 'state', 'intervention', 'make', 'association', 'estimate', 'collective', 'industry', 'debt', 'level', 'increase', 'quarter', 'around', 'part', 'half', 'recent', 'round', 'state', 'funding', 'support', 'repayble', 'form', 'iata', 'release', 'analysis', 'today', 'government', 'provide', 'financial', 'support', 'crisis', 'far', 'government', 'support', 'help', 'avert', 'potentially', 'failure', 'particularly', 'iata', 'previously', 'flag', 'carrier', 'typically', 'enough', 'cash', 'survive', 'month', 'industry', 'burning', 'cash', 'rate', 'quarter', 'effectively', 'ground', 'high', 'profile', 'carrier', 'enter', 'formal', 'restructuring', 'include', 'latin', 'america', 'big', 'latam', 'earlier', 'today', 'relatively', 'collapse', 'since', 'crisis', 'begin', 'see', 'failure', 'handful', 'say', 'iata', 'chief', 'economist', 'brian', 'pearce', 'medium', 'conference', 'today', 'cite', 'key', 'factor', 'enable', 'survive', 'crisis', 'able', 'make', 'cash', 'longer', 'cut', 'cost', 'secondly', 'turn', 'bank', 'capital', 'market', 'least', 'strong', 'turn', 'private', 'sector', 'financial', 'funding', 'raise', 'cash', 'thirdly', 'see', 'substantial', 'government', 'iata', 'note', 'government', 'support', 'form', 'state', 'loan', 'guarantee', 'defer', 'tax', 'need', 'repaid', 'large', 'chunk', 'balance', 'almost', 'wage', 'subsidy', 'scheme', 'iata', 'estimate', 'around', 'equity', 'financing', 'lot', 'debt', 'load', 'onto', 'balance', 'sheet', 'support', 'say', 'pearce', 'iata', 'estimate', 'end', 'industry', 'debt', 'combination', 'government', 'aid', 'commercial', 'loan', 'raise', 'contributes', 'expect', 'jump', 'debt', 'end', 'problem', 'see', 'equity', 'either', 'issue', 'capital', 'market', 'equity', 'injection', 'provide', 'government', 'say', 'give', 'tough', 'revenue', 'environment', 'rest', 'next', 'generate', 'cashflow', 'service', 'debt', 'challenge', 'debt', 'go', 'substantial', 'burden', 'industry', 'move', 'recovery', 'phase', 'pearce', 'add', 'consequence', 'easily', 'see', 'failure', 'weight', 'debt', 'alternatively', 'see', 'government', 'involvement', 'need', 'swap', 'debt', 'government', 'support', 'crisis', 'welcome', 'call', 'iata', 'association', 'flag', 'concern', 'uneven', 'spread', 'support', 'although', 'total', 'government', 'support', 'look', 'fairly', 'substantial', 'unevenly', 'spread', 'government', 'support', 'start', 'see', 'start', 'get', 'difficulty', 'region', 'like', 'north', 'america', 'see', 'aid', 'equivalent', 'revenue', 'substantial', 'support', 'pearce', 'say', 'add', 'europe', 'around', 'asiapacific', 'latin', 'america', 'africa', 'middle', 'east', 'see', 'support', 'barely', 'operating', 'revenue', 'clearly', 'issue', 'lack', 'support', 'emerge', 'market', 'obviously', 'pearce', 'note', 'aid', 'give', 'strong', 'clear', 'correlation', 'good', 'prior', 'financial', 'performance', 'extent', 'aid', 'say', 'country', 'crisis', 'good', 'financial', 'performance', 'get', 'little', 'support', 'remains', 'possibility', 'go', 'see', 'future', 'casualty', 'industry', 'business', 'model', 'strong', 'prior', 'iata', 'director', 'general', 'alexandre', 'de', 'juniac', 'add', 'government', 'aid', 'help', 'keep', 'industry', 'afloat', 'next', 'challenge', 'prevent', 'sinking', 'burden', 'debt', 'aid', 'create']"
"Philippine Airlines (PAL) has seen revenue shrink by nearly $1 billion since it suspended operations because of the coronavirus pandemic, the flag carrier's parent confirms. Airline president Gilbert Santa Maria was quoted in local newspaper The Philippine Star last week saying that the carrier has seen revenue slide by over $300 million per month - totalling nearly $1 billion - since suspending operations in March. PAL Holdings says that the airline had been “more or less” generating revenues of $300 million per month and Santa Maria's estimate is “not without basis”. In The Philippine Star report, which was published on 22 May and re-reported comments made to local television news channel ANC, Santa Maria also stressed that the airline is “not in immediate danger of bankruptcy”, primarily due to a Ps15 billion ($296 million) cash injection from owner Lucio Tan, who is also PAL's chairman and chief executive. PAL Holdings' 2019 financial results show it had received Ps11.4 billion from Buona Sorte Holdings (BSHI), a company owned by Tan, in the period to 31 December, followed by a separate $93 million (Ps4.7 billion) infusion in the first quarter of 2020. In 2019, PAL Holdings posted an operating profit of Ps2.87 billion and revenue grew by 2.7%, to more than Ps154 billion. Net loss, however, widened from Ps4.33 billion in 2018 to Ps10.3 billion, partly due to the adoption of a new accounting standard. Santa Maria has also suggested that PAL could reduce its fleet size and headcount. “For example, if we find out that we are going to need to return say 10-20% of our aircraft because demand just isn't there – so we don't have to pay rent, we'll return the aircraft – well that means we're going to have to reduce our flightcrews and our cabin crews by [a] similar amount because we will have fewer aircraft.” He adds that while PAL plans to resume operations after the Philippines' quarantine measures are lifted on 31 May, it will operate a limited schedule in June and July: 5-10% of its normal schedule of international flights to points in Asia and North America; and 20-30% of its previous domestic schedule.",5,135,3.0,0.1954,"passenger, loss, operating, revenue, traffic, month, increase, capacity, decline, result","['philippine', 'pal', 'see', 'revenue', 'shrink', 'nearly', 'since', 'suspend', 'operation', 'coronavirus', 'pandemic', 'flag', 'carrier', 'parent', 'confirms', 'president', 'gilbert', 'santa', 'maria', 'quote', 'local', 'newspaper', 'philippine', 'star', 'week', 'say', 'carrier', 'see', 'revenue', 'slide', 'per', 'month', 'total', 'nearly', 'since', 'suspend', 'operation', 'march', 'pal', 'holding', 'say', 'less', 'generate', 'revenue', 'per', 'month', 'santa', 'maria', 'estimate', 'without', 'basis', 'philippine', 'star', 'report', 'publish', 'may', 'rereported', 'comment', 'make', 'local', 'television', 'news', 'channel', 'anc', 'santa', 'maria', 'stress', 'immediate', 'danger', 'bankruptcy', 'primarily', 'due', 'cash', 'injection', 'owner', 'lucio', 'tan', 'pal', 'chairman', 'chief', 'executive', 'pal', 'holding', 'financial', 'result', 'receive', 'buona', 'sorte', 'holding', 'bshi', 'tan', 'period', 'december', 'follow', 'separate', 'infusion', 'quarter', 'pal', 'holding', 'post', 'operating', 'profit', 'revenue', 'grow', 'net', 'loss', 'however', 'widen', 'partly', 'due', 'adoption', 'accounting', 'standard', 'santa', 'maria', 'suggest', 'pal', 'reduce', 'fleet', 'size', 'headcount', 'example', 'find', 'go', 'need', 'return', 'say', 'demand', 'pay', 'rent', 'return', 'well', 'mean', 'go', 'reduce', 'flightcrews', 'cabin', 'crew', 'similar', 'amount', 'add', 'pal', 'plan', 'resume', 'operation', 'philippine', 'quarantine', 'measure', 'lift', 'may', 'operate', 'limited', 'schedule', 'june', 'july', 'normal', 'schedule', 'international', 'point', 'asia', 'north', 'america', 'previous', 'domestic', 'schedule']"
"An increase in aerial fire-fighting activities in Australia over recent years has contributed to a higher rate of safety incidents, according to the country's air accident investigation body, although stresses there has not been a rise in the risk per flight. In a statistical report, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) notes a faster growth in occurrences between July 2019 and March 2020 than at any time during the previous 20 years. There were also two fatal accidents between August 2018 and March 2020, compared to just three in the previous 17 years. “Given the amount of recent bushfire activity in Australia, these results could be expected and probably do not indicate a significant increase in the risk per flight,” says the ATSB. The 2019–2020 fire season is estimated have seen around four times the aerial firefighting activity than other recent bushfire seasons. “However, it does indicate that the reported occurrences associated with aerial firefighting are probably increasing.” The report does not refer to specific incidents, but a major accident occurred in February when a Lockheed Martin EC-130Q operated by Coulson Aviation, crashed while fighting fires in New South Wales, killing three crew members. As for the aircraft types involved in safety incidents while firefighting, “almost half” involved turboshaft-powered helicopters. When hours flown and the number of flights are taken into account, however, the safety occurrence rate is in line with other categories. Moreover, piston-powered helicopters were more than twice as likely than turboshaft-powered helicopters to be involved in a severe occurrence. “Over the [20-year] study period, over half of reported occurrences, all fatal accidents and four fifths of more severe occurrences were operational in nature,” says ATSB. “Terrain collisions accounted for around half of the operational occurrences and 71 per cent of the more severe occurrences. Additionally, around one quarter of operational more severe occurrences involved aircraft control.”",5,136,6.0,0.2362,"engine, maintenance, fuel, takeoff, result, failure, system, problem, power, issue","['increase', 'aerial', 'firefighting', 'activity', 'australia', 'recent', 'contribute', 'high', 'rate', 'safety', 'incident', 'accord', 'country', 'accident', 'investigation', 'body', 'although', 'stress', 'rise', 'risk', 'per', 'statistical', 'report', 'australian', 'transport', 'safety', 'bureau', 'atsb', 'note', 'faster', 'growth', 'occurrence', 'july', 'march', 'previous', 'fatal', 'accident', 'august', 'march', 'compare', 'previous', 'give', 'amount', 'recent', 'bushfire', 'activity', 'australia', 'result', 'expect', 'probably', 'indicate', 'significant', 'increase', 'risk', 'per', 'say', 'atsb', 'fire', 'season', 'estimate', 'see', 'around', 'aerial', 'firefighting', 'activity', 'recent', 'bushfire', 'season', 'however', 'indicate', 'report', 'occurrence', 'associate', 'aerial', 'firefighting', 'probably', 'report', 'refer', 'specific', 'incident', 'major', 'accident', 'occur', 'february', 'lockheed', 'martin', 'operate', 'coulson', 'crashed', 'fight', 'fire', 'south', 'wale', 'kill', 'crew', 'member', 'type', 'involve', 'safety', 'incident', 'firefighting', 'almost', 'half', 'involve', 'turboshaftpowered', 'helicopter', 'hour', 'flown', 'number', 'take', 'account', 'however', 'safety', 'occurrence', 'rate', 'line', 'category', 'moreover', 'pistonpowered', 'helicopter', 'twice', 'likely', 'turboshaftpowered', 'helicopter', 'involve', 'severe', 'occurrence', 'study', 'period', 'half', 'report', 'occurrence', 'fatal', 'accident', 'fifth', 'severe', 'occurrence', 'operational', 'nature', 'say', 'atsb', 'terrain', 'collision', 'account', 'around', 'half', 'operational', 'occurrence', 'per', 'cent', 'severe', 'occurrence', 'additionally', 'around', 'quarter', 'operational', 'severe', 'occurrence', 'involve', 'control']"
"Air Canada starting 1 June plans to fly three modified Airbus A319s with only 58 business-class seats between Toronto, Montreal and Ottowa, aiming to maintain air travel while minimizing the risk of coronavirus infection. The flights sold through its charter subsidiary Air Canada Jetz will fly one morning and one evening round-trip between the three locations without any middle seats to minimize infections, the carrier announced on 22 May. The aircraft were modified from a typical 120-seat configuration for business-class charter travel prior to the coronavirus pandemic that led to a sharp decline in air travel since March. Prior to the pandemic these Air Canada Jetz aircraft flew hockey teams to games across North America. Now that professional sports are suspended along with other public gatherings, Air Canada aims to use its unique assets to offer a safer form of air travel. “Airlines like Air Canada are trying whatever they can to motivate traffic back into the planes in this transitional period,” Air Canada chief financial officer Michael Rousseau said on 19 May during a virtual meeting of the Wolfe Global Transportation Conference. The same day that Rousseau spoke, the USA and Canada extended restrictions at their borders to prevent any non-essential travel through 22 June.

"Russian investigators probing an Airbus A321 hard landing have made the extraordinary accusation that its cockpit-voice recorder was erased and fitted in another aircraft, then re-installed in the damaged jet, ahead of the inquiry commission's arrival. The Nordwind A321 – on final approach to Antalya's runway 36C on 10 January – sustained serious damage after the aircraft, which had slowed below its lowest selectable speed threshold moments before touchdown, was abruptly pitched down and struck the runway nose-gear first. Its crew subsequently executed a go-around, with multiple system problems emerging, before landing on the same runway. None of the seven crew members, the only occupants, was injured. But in its preliminary factual findings from the accident the Interstate Aviation Committee says that the cockpit-voice recorder, while being analysed in Moscow, revealed only a few seconds of information. It says this indicates the button to erase the cockpit-voice recorder “was pressed in the cockpit”. Investigators used specialist techniques to retrieve just over 2h 4min of recordings, but found there was “no record” of the incident on 10 January. But there was a record of a subsequent flight – the next day, 11 January – by a different Nordwind A321 flying the route from Antalya to Moscow Sheremetyevo. There were also recordings of Russian maintenance personnel at Sheremetyevo carrying out maintenance on 11-12 January, and then discussions on 13 January including remarks about pushing the cockpit-voice recorder 'erase' button. The Interstate Aviation Committee says it was informed of the accident on 14 January. Although investigators found the cockpit-voice and flight-data recorders fitted on the damaged aircraft, the operator already had a copy of the flight-data recording. Both recorders were sent to Moscow for analysis, where the missing cockpit-voice information was discovered. The inquiry believes that, in the aftermath of the accident to the A321 (VQ-BRS), both recorders were removed and taken to Antalya's RMS Technic maintenance facility, and the voice recorder was fitted to a second A321 (VP-BHN) flying the return service to Moscow. After this A321 arrived in Moscow, it was removed by another maintenance firm, NW Technic, and – in hand luggage on an Aeroflot flight – transported back to RMS Technic in Antalya where the recorder was refitted to the original damaged A321, before the inquiry team arrived. “The [inquiry] believes the loss of information recorded [on the cockpit recorder] of VQ-BRS became possible as a result of non-compliance by officials of [the airline and maintenance companies],” it says, pointing out that pre-emptive retrieval of flight-recorder information is prohibited. FlightGlobal has contacted Nordwind, NW Technic and RMS Technic for comment on the investigators' findings. The inquiry has recommended that Russian and Turkish regulators “evaluate the actions” of officials of the three companies regarding the loss of the cockpit-voice recording. Analysis of the accident sequence determined that the autopilot and autothrust were disengaged during the base leg and the aircraft was flown manually during the final approach. The crew lowered the landing-gear at 164kt, while at 1,500ft and 5.4nm from the runway, and selected full flap. At 3nm and 1,035ft the aircraft was stable. But as it descended below 270ft – about 100ft above ground – its airspeed began to fall below the approach speed of 122kt. It further decayed to 115kt, below the lowest-selectable speed threshold of 117kt, while descending at 700ft/min. At 20ft above the runway the airspeed reached its minimum of 109kt, with the aircraft pitched 5.5° nose-up, idle thrust was selected. Then the captain abruptly moved the sidestick fully forward, holding it there for 1.5s, resulting in a sudden, sharp reduction in pitch at a rate of 9°/s. Although the captain simultaneously applied full thrust, the aircraft had pitched nose-down by 3.9° and its nose-gear struck the runway with a 2.64g impact. It bounced and the captain pulled the sidestick, while sidestick input also registered from the first officer's position. Several systems immediately began to fail. The A321's flight-control system switched to direct law, two inertial reference systems failed, and attitude indications disappeared from the captain's instruments. Although the flaps were partially retracted during the go-around, the landing-gear could not be retracted – the crew claimed the lever jammed. The first officer was given control of the aircraft, because the attitude indicators were still functioning on the right side, and trimmed it. As the aircraft reached 920ft an avionics smoke alarm triggered and the crew declared an emergency. The third inertial reference system failed at 3,400ft, the attitude indicator on the first officer's side disappeared, and the captain retook control. The crew carried out a flypast for a visual inspection of the landing-gear before attempting another approach. As it passed over the runway the crew received alerts about two different hydraulic circuits. The inquiry says a total of 103 failure messages, concerning various systems, were received. With the landing-gear confirmed in the deployed position, the crew completed the approach and landed on runway 36C where the A321 came to a halt. In its analysis the Interstate Aviation Committee, which published its findings in April, made a number of recommendations about improved awareness of stable approach criteria, go-around procedures, and prevention of hard landings.",5,138,7.0,0.6416,"crew, runway, inquiry, land, approach, accident, investigator, captain, incident, pilot","['russian', 'investigator', 'probe', 'hard', 'land',

"The flight data and cockpit voice recorders of the Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) Airbus A320 that crashed on 22 May have been recovered. Media reports from Pakistan quote PIA as saying that both devices were found on Saturday 23 May, a day after the aircraft crashed in an urban area. The aircraft had operated flight PK8303 from Lahore and crashed while the crew attempted to conduct a go around. Video images on social media purporting to show the aircraft's final moments indicate that it descended into a built-up area with a high nose attitude and its landing-gear deployed. The aircraft bore the registration AP-BLD (MSN 2274)) and 91 passengers and eight crew were aboard. Reports from Pakistan suggest the death toll stands at 97. While some of those on the aircraft survived the disaster, there were fatalities on the ground. Cirium fleets analyser shows that AP-BLD is managed by GECAS. It served with China Eastern Airlines from 2003 to 2014, when it moved to PIA. It was powered by a pair of CFM International CFM56 engines.

"Mitsubishi Aircraft is closing all non-Japan locations and moving all SpaceJet activities back to its headquarters in Nagoya, Japan, a move coming in response to cost pressure amid the coronavirus aerospace downturn. As part of the consolidation to Japan, the company will halt flight testing of its 90-seat SpaceJet M90 regional jet and suspend development of its 76-seat M100, Mitsubishi Aircraft says.  The SpaceJet M90 at the 2019 Paris air show The airframer is continuing M90 certification efforts, though those activities will shift for now to validation and other back-office work, it says. The company will also reevaluate the M90 certification plan after hitting budget objectives, Mitsubishi Aircraft says. Mitsubishi Aircraft had been flight testing the M90 in the USA at Moses Lake, and in Japan. The overseas closures target all non-Japan locations. Mitsubishi Aircraft has not announced any change to a plan under which its parent Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) will acquire Bombardier's CRJ programme for $550 million. Just weeks ago, Mitsubishi and Bombardier said that deal would close on 1 June. News of the overseas retreat follows an announcement last week that Mitsubishi Heavy Industries would halve the SpaceJet's budget for the year ending 31 March 2021. At that time, MHI also said it would review development of the M100, which Mitsubishi Aircraft launched at the Paris air show in 2019.",5,140,0.0,0.3788,"order, business, jet, delivery, production, customer, deliver, commercial, quarter, include","['mitsubishi', 'closing', 'nonjapan', 'location', 'move', 'spacejet', 'activity', 'back', 'headquarters', 'nagoya', 'japan', 'move', 'come', 'response', 'cost', 'pressure', 'amid', 'coronavirus', 'downturn', 'part', 'consolidation', 'japan', 'halt', 'test', 'spacejet', 'regional', 'jet', 'suspend', 'development', 'mitsubishi', 'say', 'spacejet', 'paris', 'airframer', 'continue', 'certification', 'effort', 'though', 'activity', 'shift', 'validation', 'backoffice', 'work', 'say', 'reevaluate', 'certification', 'plan', 'hit', 'budget', 'objective', 'mitsubishi', 'say', 'mitsubishi', 'test', 'usa', 'moses', 'lake', 'japan', 'overseas', 'closure', 'target', 'nonjapan', 'location', 'mitsubishi', 'announce', 'change', 'plan', 'parent', 'mitsubishi', 'heavy', 'industry', 'mhi', 'acquire', 'bombardier', 'crj', 'programme', 'week', 'ago', 'mitsubishi', 'bombardier', 'say', 'deal', 'close', 'june', 'news', 'overseas', 'retreat', 'follow', 'announcement', 'week', 'mitsubishi', 'heavy', 'industry', 'halve', 'spacejet', 'budget', 'end', 'march', 'mhi', 'say', 'review', 'development', 'mitsubishi', 'launch', 'paris']"
"As the global coronavirus pandemic drags on, travellers and crew on intercontinental flights are getting used to wearing face coverings in public spaces and adhering to other measures such as social distancing, imposed by airlines, airports and authorities to stop the spread of infection. But while the industry is still seeing significantly lower passenger traffic than just three months ago, travellers who venture abroad have to deal with a patchwork of government regulations that can be confusing for the uninitiated or the unprepared. Michael Gallagher, in transit from Frankfurt to Chicago on 22 May and whose job regularly takes him to Asia and Europe, says flexibility is key to navigating travel in the age of corona. “The hardest thing about all this is that the rules are different everywhere, and sometimes you even get wrong information at the airport,” he says. For example, at Germany's Frankfurt International airport on 22 May, check-in agents advised passengers that due to “federal police regulations” they were only permitted to take one piece of carry-on luggage through the security checkpoint, even though their airline had told them a carry-on bag and a personal item were allowed. However, at the security checkpoint, officers said there was no one-bag rule. “It's all a bit baffling,” Gallagher adds. “The people working at the airport don't even know the rules.” On a recent transatlantic flight, operated on a Boeing 747-8 aircraft, the total passenger count was 111 – zero in first class, 11 in business class, and 100 in economy, one flight attendant said. Normally, that aircraft can carry almost 300 passengers. All passengers over the age of six were required to wear face coverings. Much of the drop off in demand is a result of government-imposed shelter-in-place orders or quarantine requirements. But as the number of newly-reported cases begins to decline globally, countries are reassessing regulations and airlines are beginning to reinstate some suspended flights. Lufthansa, for example, said on 15 May it will add 80 destinations to its June schedule, including to traditional European summer vacation spots like Spain and Greece. On 12 May, a German court struck down the federal government's blanket quarantine order for all incoming passengers to isolate for 14 days following arrival, which had been in place since mid-April. The court in the state of Lower Saxony said in its ruling that there was no reason to isolate and curtail the liberties of healthy people if they showed no signs of illness. The entry restrictions are expected to be dropped nationwide in coming days. In the past few weeks, travellers arriving in Germany were given an information sheet about the regulations while on their inbound flights, and once through the immigration checkpoint, largely left on their own. Travellers to the United States, however, must fill out a written questionnaire asking where they had arrived from and possible symptoms they may have experienced, in addition to contact information. Once they land on US soil, they are questioned in person by a screener, and their temperature is checked before they are permitted to pick up their luggage. Beyond that, no information is given. In Asia, authorities continue to implement stringent quarantine regulations for arriving passengers and crew. Last week, a FedEx pilot was sentenced to time in jail in Singapore after leaving his hotel room during his mandated quarantine, according to reports. Another cargo pilot, who had recently flown to Japan, said on 22 May that crew were confined to their rooms during the period they were in transit in the country. But non-US-citizen airline crew members heading to the United States said they are permitted to leave their hotels and engage in normal activities – as per the relevant restrictions of the region they are visiting - during layovers. “We've been told we are allowed out, and that there are no restrictions,” the flight attendant said.",5,141,12.0,0.3596,"travel, government, country, coronavirus, measure, restriction, passenger, state, march, canada","['global', 'coronavirus', 'pandemic', 'drag', 'traveller', 'crew', 'intercontinental', 'get', 'use', 'wear', 'face', 'covering', 'public', 'space', 'adhere', 'measure', 'social', 'distance', 'impose', 'airport', 'authority', 'stop', 'spread', 'infection', 'industry', 'still', 'see', 'significantly', 'low', 'passenger', 'traffic', 'month', 'ago', 'traveller', 'venture', 'abroad', 'deal', 'patchwork', 'government', 'regulation', 'confuse', 'uninitiated', 'unprepared', 'michael', 'gallagher', 'transit', 'frankfurt', 'chicago', 'may', 'whose', 'job', 'regularly', 'take', 'asia', 'europe', 'say', 'flexibility', 'key', 'navigate', 'travel', 'age', 'corona', 'hardest', 'thing', 'rule', 'different', 'everywhere', 'sometimes', 'even', 'get', 'wrong', 'information', 'airport', 'say', 'example', 'germany', 'frankfurt', 'international', 'airport', 'may', 'checkin', 'agent', 'advise', 'passenger', 'due', 'federal', 'police', 'regulation', 'permit', 'take', 'piece', 'carryon', 'luggage', 'security', 'checkpoint', 'even', 'though', 'told', 'carryon', 'bag', 'personal', 'item', 'allow', 'however', 'security', 'checkpoint', 'officer', 'say', 'onebag', 'rule', 'bit', 'baffling', 'gallagher', 'add', 'people', 'work', 'airport', 'even', 'know', 'recent', 'transatlantic', 'operate', 'total', 'passenger', 'count', 'zero', 'class', 'business', 'class', 'economy', 'attendant', 'say', 'normally', 'carry', 'almost', 'passenger', 'passenger', 'age', 'require', 'wear', 'face', 'covering', 'much', 'drop', 'demand', 'result', 'governmentimposed', 'shelterinplace', 'order', 'quarantine', 'requirement', 'number', 'newlyreported', 'case', 'begin', 'decline', 'globally', 'country', 'reassess', 'regulation', 'begin', 'reinstate', 'suspend', 'lufthansa', 'example', 'say', 'may', 'add', 'destination', 'june', 'schedule', 'include', 'traditional', 'european', 'summer', 'vacation', 'spot', 'like', 'spain', 'greece', 'may', 'german', 'court', 'struck', 'federal', 'government', 'blanket', 'quarantine', 'order', 'incoming', 'passenger', 'isolate', 'day', 'follow', 'arrival', 'place', 'since', 'midapril', 'court', 'state', 'low', 'saxony', 'say', 'ruling', 'reason', 'isolate', 'curtail', 'liberty', 'healthy', 'people', 'sign', 'illness', 'entry', 'restriction', 'expect', 'drop', 'nationwide', 'come', 'day', 'past', 'week', 'traveller', 'arrive', 'germany', 'give', 'information', 'sheet', 'regulation', 'inbound', 'immigration', 'checkpoint', 'largely', 'left', 'traveller', 'united', 'state', 'however', 'must', 'fill', 'write', 'questionnaire', 'ask', 'arrive', 'possible', 'symptom', 'may', 'experienced', 'addition', 'contact', 'information', 'land', 'u', 'soil', 'question', 'person', 'screener', 'temperature', 'checked', 'permit', 'pick', 'luggage', 'beyond', 'information', 'give', 'asia', 'authority', 'continue', 'implement', 'stringent', 'quarantine', 'regulation', 'arrive', 'passenger', 'crew', 'week', 'fedex', 'pilot', 'sentence', 'jail', 'singapore', 'leave', 'hotel', 'room', 'mandate', 'quarantine', 'accord', 'report', 'another', 'cargo', 'pilot', 'recently', 'flown', 'japan', 'say', 'may', 'crew', 'confine', 'room', 'period', 'transit', 'country', 'nonuscitizen', 'crew', 'member', 'head', 'united', 'state', 'say', 'permit', 'leave', 'hotel', 'engage', 'normal', 'activity', 'per', 'relevant', 'restriction', 'region', 'visit', 'layover', 'told', 'allow', 'restriction', 'attendant', 'say']"
"Pakistan International Airlines is referring to evidence of a “technical fault” on the Airbus A320 which crashed while attempting to land at Karachi. Air-ground communications from flight PK8303 reveal that the crew tried to execute a go-around while conducting an ILS approach to runway 25L, following a service from Lahore on 22 May. But the crew subsequently seemed unable to hold the required altitude and then informed air traffic control that they had “lost engines”. Pakistan's federal minister for aviation, Ghulam Sarwar Khan, says an “immediate inquiry” has been ordered to “ascertain the facts related to the crash”. PIA says the crew reported a “technical fault” and that, shortly afterwards, contact was lost. “Details of what the actual technical fault was can only be established once [an] inquiry is started and critical aircraft parts and evidence from the site is recovered and analysed,” it says. But PIA states that preliminary information points to an “uneventful flight” up to the final approach, during which the crew contacted controllers and provided an “arrival report with everything normal”. The radio communications show the crew reported being “comfortable now” – although the reason for this declaration is unclear – and that the aircraft was descending through 3,500ft for 3,000ft and established on the ILS for 25L. But after confirming again to controllers that the aircraft was established in the ILS, and receiving landing clearance, the crew's next radio transmission appeared to feature the sound of a background chiming. The pilots then informed controllers that they were conducting a go-around and wanted to make another attempt to carry out the ILS approach. But after instructing the crew to turn left on a heading of 110° and climb to 3,000ft, the controller informed that the aircraft was “dropping altitude” to 2,000ft – at which point the pilot asked for 2,000ft instead. Even after having this altitude approved, the crew appeared to be having problems, telling the controller that the aircraft was “now maintaining...trying to maintain”. The controller then queried why the aircraft appeared to be turning left, to which the crew responded: “We have lost engines.” Shortly afterwards the crew transmitted a 'mayday' distress signal and the controller told them that both runways were available for landing. Communications were archived by LiveATC. Video images circulating on social media purported showing the aircraft's final moments indicated that it descended into a built-up area with a high nose attitude and its landing-gear deployed. At least one photograph, claiming to show the jet prior to the crash with its landing-gear retracted, indicates that the ram-air turbine – located on the left underside of the central fuselage – was deployed. Ram-air turbine power enables critical systems to function in the event that primary power sources are unavailable. The same image also appears to show underside damage to both engines, the nature and origin of which is unclear. The status of the undercarriage during the first approach has not been confirmed. Airbus has formally identified the aircraft involved as AP-BLD, a CFM International CFM56-powered jet, and indicates that 91 passengers and eight crew members were on board. It stresses that it has “no confirmed information concerning the circumstances of the accident”. But it states that the aircraft (MSN2274) entered service in 2004 and had been operating with PIA since 2014. Airbus adds that the aircraft had accumulated about 47,100h over the course of 25,860 cycles. The Pakistan civil aviation authority says the aircraft had undertaken eight flights since 21 March, when domestic and international flights were suspended in response to the coronavirus outbreak. It adds that the jet underwent an A-check in March. Pakistani investigators are heading the inquiry, but technical support will be provided by Airbus through the French investigation authority BEA.

"Ryanair Group has followed through on its threat to close Lauda's Vienna base after failing to reach an agreement on cost reductions. The airline's Airbus A320 base in Austria will close on 29 May, resulting in the loss of 300 jobs. Lauda says it “deeply regrets” the closure of the base and places the blame directly on the Vida union. “Shamefully, the Vida union ignored the wishes of over 95% of pilots and 70% of cabin crew at Lauda's A320 Vienna base and has destroyed over 300 well paid jobs,” state Lauda joint chief executives Andreas Gruber and David O'Brien. ”Lauda also deplores the inaction of the Austrian government which could have used its €800 million [$873 million] state aid to Lufthansa subsidiary Austrian Airlines to require Vida to save the jobs of Lauda's A320 Vienna crews.” Ryanair warned earlier this month that it would close Lauda's Vienna base if “meaningful” cost reductions could not be agreed by 20 May. It said that costs at the Austrian unit were “running ahead” of other airlines in the group, and that the management team was putting in place a restructuring plan. Vienna is the largest ofLauda's four bases.

"Cockpit crew representatives are cautioning that resumption of flight operations as the coronavirus crisis recedes will require careful consideration of varying training levels for returning pilots. There will be a range of situations that operators will need to take into account, says international airline pilot federation IFALPA. Some pilots will have continued conducting services, such as those who have flown freight flights during the pandemic, while others will have stayed qualified and current but been subjected to a prolonged absence from operations. Pilots might have remained qualified but operating under regulatory exemptions, while others will have fallen short of requirement for recent flight experience – including the need to perform at least three take-offs, approaches and landings in the last 90 days – or lost qualification altogether. “Minimum training required to requalify a pilot to the regulatory standard may not be sufficient following either a break in operational status or loss of qualification,” says the federation. “Operators must be prepared to provide training above the minimum required by the regulatory authority.” Experienced and long-serving pilots will not necessarily need the same level of restorative training as a relatively new crew member, it says. But the federation also points out that even pilots who have the proficiency and qualifications might need a certain level of training to ensure they are sufficiently confident to return to line flying. “Operators should allow pilots the opportunity to request additional training over and above the normal or expected training footprint,” it adds. Effective return to line operations requires co-operation between the regulatory authorities, the operator, and the cockpit crew members, it says – pointing out that trainers and examiners might also need to undergo their own requalification as a result of the coronavirus disruption. “It is recognised that there will be an increased burden to airlines' training departments,” the federation says. “While it is important that training be designed and conducted efficiently, it is critical that the training is not rushed and its quality is not compromised.” The circumstances of the currency lapses should not be used as an excuse for regulatory waivers allowing retraining on a lower level training device. Nor should on-aircraft training be carried out if it would not normally be. As well as informing pilots of any regular changes in standard procedures, the federation adds, operators must also ensure that crews are aware of any significant amendments introduced as a direct consequence of the coronavirus crisis.",5,145,11.0,0.3786,"pilot, faa, issue, safety, include, report, require, training, ground, order","['cockpit', 'crew', 'representative', 'caution', 'resumption', 'operation', 'coronavirus', 'crisis', 'recedes', 'require', 'careful', 'consideration', 'vary', 'training', 'level', 'return', 'pilot', 'range', 'situation', 'operator', 'need', 'take', 'account', 'say', 'international', 'pilot', 'federation', 'ifalpa', 'pilot', 'continued', 'conduct', 'service', 'flown', 'freight', 'pandemic', 'others', 'stayed', 'qualify', 'current', 'subject', 'prolong', 'absence', 'operation', 'pilot', 'might', 'remain', 'qualify', 'operating', 'regulatory', 'exemption', 'others', 'fall', 'short', 'requirement', 'recent', 'experience', 'include', 'need', 'perform', 'least', 'takeoff', 'approach', 'landing', 'day', 'lose', 'qualification', 'altogether', 'minimum', 'training', 'require', 'requalify', 'pilot', 'regulatory', 'standard', 'may', 'sufficient', 'follow', 'either', 'break', 'operational', 'status', 'loss', 'qualification', 'say', 'federation', 'operator', 'must', 'prepared', 'provide', 'training', 'minimum', 'require', 'regulatory', 'experienced', 'longserving', 'pilot', 'necessarily', 'need', 'level', 'restorative', 'training', 'relatively', 'crew', 'member', 'say', 'federation', 'point', 'even', 'pilot', 'proficiency', 'qualification', 'might', 'need', 'certain', 'level', 'training', 'ensure', 'sufficiently', 'confident', 'return', 'line', 'fly', 'operator', 'allow', 'pilot', 'opportunity', 'request', 'additional', 'training', 'normal', 'expect', 'training', 'footprint', 'add', 'effective', 'return', 'line', 'operation', 'require', 'cooperation', 'regulatory', 'authority', 'operator', 'cockpit', 'crew', 'member', 'say', 'point', 'trainer', 'examiner', 'might', 'need', 'undergo', 'requalification', 'result', 'coronavirus', 'disruption', 'recognise', 'increase', 'burden', 'training', 'department', 'federation', 'say', 'important', 'training', 'design', 'conduct', 'efficiently', 'critical', 'training', 'rush', 'quality', 'circumstance', 'currency', 'lapse', 'use', 'excuse', 'regulatory', 'waiver', 'allow', 'retrain', 'low', 'level', 'training', 'device', 'onaircraft', 'training', 'carry', 'normally', 'well', 'inform', 'pilot', 'regular', 'change', 'standard', 'procedure', 'federation', 'add', 'operator', 'must', 'ensure', 'crew', 'aware', 'significant', 'amendment', 'introduce', 'direct', 'consequence', 'coronavirus', 'crisis']"
"Clarity has yet to emerge over the circumstances in which a Boeing 737-800 arrived at San Diego missing a number of structural parts from its vertical fin. The aircraft, registered N820TJ, was photographed landing at San Diego at around 15:55 on 19 May, after arriving from Southern California Logistics Airport near Victorville. The aircraft touched down on runway 27. Its vertical fin root – from around station lines 1257 to 1396, a section some 3.5m in length – appears entirely absent while a number of panels are also missing between spar attachment points on the left side of the fin. Images of the aircraft circulating on social media also indicate dents in the leading edge of the left-hand horizontal stabiliser. Neither the US FAA nor the US National Transportation Safety Board had recorded any incident involving the aircraft, as of 22 May. IAero Group is listed as the operator of the aircraft. It took over US charter carrier Swift Air last year, rebranding it as IAero Airways. The company has yet to respond to inquiries on the situation. Air-ground communications between San Diego tower and the aircraft during its arrival, archived by LiveATC, do not appear to indicate anything abnormal.

"PAL Holdings posted an operating profit of Ps2.87 billion ($56.6 million) in 2019, reversing 2018's Ps5.98 billion operating loss. Total revenue at the parent company of Philippine Airlines (PAL) grew 2.7% to more than Ps154 billion, driven by a 4.2% increase in the passenger segment revenue to Ps134 billion. Ancillary revenue fell 5% to Ps10.7 billion, while cargo fell 8.2% to Ps9.38 billion. Expenses declined 3% to nearly Ps152 billion, led by a reduction in costs from flying operations. Net loss widened from Ps4.33 billion in 2018 to Ps10.3 billion, partly due to the adoption of a new accounting standard. Cash and cash equivalents stood at Ps15.1 billion as at 31 December 2019, up from the Ps6.98 billion on 31 December 2018. PAL ended 2019 with 97 aircraft, unchanged from the previous year.

"The US Army's Improved Turbine Engine Programme (ITEP) is scheduled to receive a critical design review in mid-June. Development of the GE Aviation T901-GE-900 turboshaft was delayed by two weeks due to coronavirus disruptions, but is still ahead of schedule, says US Army Colonel Roger Kuykendall, Aviation Turbine Engines project manager, on 7 May. “We continue to monitor and assess [risks] daily, in conjunction with [GE Aviation] to minimise future impacts,” he says. ITEP is the designated engine for the US Army's forthcoming scout helicopter, the Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft (FARA). Bell's 360 Invictus and Sikorsky's Raider X are competing in the FARA development programme. The service wants a new rotorcraft designed, built, tested, flown and fielded to its first unit by 2028. The T901 will also replace T700 turboshafts that power the US Army's Boeing AH-64 Apache attack helicopters and Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk utility helicopters. The service plans to install T901s into 1,300 UH-60s and more than 600 AH-64s after 2025. The new ITEP engine is to be 50% more powerful – 3,000shp (2,240kW) – 25% more fuel efficient, and provide a 20% longer design life over the T700. It should also be able to maintain performance at 6,000ft and 35°C (95°F). US Army helicopters have previously struggled to fly in those conditions, which are commonly found in hot and high-altitude countries like Afghanistan. For a UH-60 carrying nine troops that means a range extension of 161% to 141nm (261km).

"Cambodia has removed its ban on visitors from France, Germany, Iran, Italy, Spain and the United States, which was first imposed in mid-March amidst the Covid-19 pandemic. The Agence Kampuchea Presse (AKP) national news agency reported on 20 May that visitors from these countries are now allowed to enter the country, but with conditions. The AKP report adds that all passengers entering Cambodia will be required to have a health certificate, which certifies that the passenger has been tested negative for Covid-19. A health risk assessment will also be made to anyone entering the country. In addition, foreign nationals must provide proof of insurance coverage during their intended stay in Cambodia with a minimum medical coverage of not less than $50,000. Cirium schedules data show that in May 2020, just over 26,000 seats are being offered by 15 carriers on flights departing out of Cambodia for the month. This is a far cry from the 648,700 seats that were offered by 44 carriers in May 2019. The data also indicate that Cambodia Angkor Air is offering nearly 10,000 seats in May 2020, the highest of all 15 carriers. Asiana Airlines is the largest foreign operator into the country for the month, where it is offering 2,500 seats. Emirates and Qatar Airways are the only non-Asian carriers to fly into Cambodia. Meanwhile, a search on Phnom Penh airport's website shows that there are four flights scheduled to operate on 21 May. Two of these are bound for China, while the remaining two are to the domestic destinations of Siem Reap and Sihanoukville. Cirium data show that Cambodia has six local airlines: Bassaka Air, Cambodia Airways, Cambodia Angkor Air, JC International Airlines, Lanmei Airlines, and Sky Angkor Airlines.

"South Africa's government has provisionally set aside R3.8 billion ($212 million) for troubled flag-carrier South African Airways and another R164 million for SA Express in the current fiscal year. Department of public enterprises deputy director general Kgathatso Tlhakudi gave the figure during a 20 May presentation before the parliamentary portfolio committee on public enterprises. Tlhakudi pointed out that the budget allocated by the treasury is “under strain” owing to “unplanned spending” to cope with the coronavirus crisis, and that it “will look different in a couple of weeks”. But he highlighted a transfer of R37 billion to state-owned enterprises this year, with the vast majority to electricity utility firm Eskom. The figures also included R3.8 billion to South African Airways in 2020-21, part of a R9.9 billion sum set aside for the medium term. SAA's allocation includes R4.3 billion for 2021-22 and R1.77 billion for 2022-23. The flag-carrier has been undergoing a business rescue process since December last year, and public enterprises minister Pravin Gordhan has been hoping to create a new, more sustainable airline from SAA.

"Rolls-Royce has increased its civil aerospace workforce by about one-third over the last 10 years, but admits that deep cuts in the sector will be necessary during its newly-unveiled restructuring. The company employs 26,100 personnel in the civil aerospace sector – accounting for about half its global workforce – with around two-thirds of its civil aerospace staff in the UK. Given that the overall workforce reduction will amount to 9,000 personnel, and civil aerospace will bear the burden, the UK is likely to be badly hit by the cuts. The Unite union is expecting nearly 3,400 job losses in the UK this year and more in 2021. There are six primary civil aerospace facilities in the UK, including the Derby headquarters. The company has yet to indicate whether workforce reductions would result in any of these being forced to shut. Rolls-Royce says a previous restructuring programme, detailed in mid-2018, will “transition” into the broader re-organisation of the company. This earlier restructuring emerged as Rolls-Royce was dealing with the fallout from Trent 1000 technical problems as well as the impact of a fraud investigation which had led to a heavy financial penalty. It focused on simplifying corporate and support functions, with a planned reduction of 4,600 jobs in these areas, mainly in the UK. Rolls-Royce says this restructuring programme has “substantially delivered on its objectives”. But the new measures will address the core civil aerospace operation which had already been under pressure from a weak long-haul aircraft market. Rolls-Royce is particularly exposed to this weakness because it is not heavily involved in the single-aisle sector. Although Rolls-Royce delivered 510 large civil engines last year – a record for the company – it had already trimmed its output forecast for this year back to 450 engines, and 400-450 over the medium term. Rolls-Royce exclusively supplies engines for the Airbus A350, A330neo and competes for business on the Boeing 787. But the coronavirus crisis has wrecked the air transport sector and prompted Airbus and Boeing to slash production rates on all three programmes. Airbus had also previously opted to discontinue A380 production, for which Rolls-Royce offered powerplants. Over the first four months of the year Boeing has delivered six Rolls-Royce-powered civil aircraft while Airbus has delivered 17. Rolls-Royce's main revenue stream in civil aerospace, however, derives from aftermarket services which accounted last year for 25% more underlying revenues for the company – more than €3.2 billion – than original equipment in the large engine sector. But fleet grounding means the maintenance and servicing business models start to break down and flying-hour receipts begin to dry up. The impact of coronavirus has been reflected in Rolls-Royce's share price which has fallen by 60% in the three months to 20 May. Rolls-Royce has furloughed around 4,000 personnel but a government-funded job-retention scheme is only intended to cover the immediate impact of the coronavirus crisis, whereas the air transport industry appears likely to remain crippled for two or three years. Chief executive Warren East points out that the government “cannot replace” demand that no longer exists. But he insists: “We have emerged from troubled times before, to achieve incredible things. We will do so again.” The Unite union, unsurprisingly, has expressed shock over the scale of the broader restructuring, and argues that Rolls-Royce should “step back from the brink” and explore alternatives. “We will be meeting with the company over the coming days to convince them to take a different approach, and pressing the government to step up to the plate to protect our manufacturing base,” says assistant general secretary for manufacturing Steve Turner, stating that the UK government should establish a national council for recovery and work with personnel representatives.",5,151,6.0,0.148,"engine, maintenance, fuel, takeoff, result, failure, system, problem, power, issue","['rollsroyce', 'increase', 'civil', 'workforce', 'onethird', 'admits', 'deep', 'cut', 'sector', 'necessary', 'newlyunveiled', 'restructuring', 'employ', 'personnel', 'civil', 'sector', 'accounting', 'half', 'global', 'workforce', 'around', 'twothirds', 'civil', 'staff', 'uk', 'give', 'overall', 'workforce', 'reduction', 'amount', 'personnel', 'civil', 'bear', 'burden', 'uk', 'likely', 'badly', 'hit', 'cut', 'unite', 'union', 'expect', 'nearly', 'job', 'loss', 'uk', 'primary', 'civil', 'facility', 'uk', 'include', 'derby', 'headquarters', 'yet', 'indicate', 'whether', 'workforce', 'reduction', 'result', 'force', 'shut', 'rollsroyce', 'say', 'previous', 'restructuring', 'programme', 'detailed', 'transition', 'broader', 'reorganisation', 'earlier', 'restructuring', 'emerge', 'rollsroyce', 'deal', 'fallout', 'trent', 'technical', 'problem', 'well', 'impact', 'fraud', 'investigation', 'lead', 'heavy', 'financial', 'penalty', 'focus', 'simplify', 'corporate', 'support', 'function', 'plan', 'reduction', 'job', 'area', 'mainly', 'uk', 'rollsroyce', 'say', 'restructuring', 'programme', 'substantially', 'deliver', 'objective', 'measure', 'address', 'core', 'civil', 'operation', 'already', 'pressure', 'weak', 'longhaul', 'market', 'rollsroyce', 'particularly', 'expose', 'weakness', 'heavily', 'involve', 'singleaisle', 'sector', 'although', 'rollsroyce', 'deliver', 'large', 'civil', 'engine', 'record', 'already', 'trim', 'output', 'forecast', 'back', 'engine', 'medium', 'term', 'rollsroyce', 'exclusively', 'supply', 'engine', 'competes', 'business', 'coronavirus', 'crisis', 'wreck', 'transport', 'sector', 'prompt', 'slash', 'production', 'rate', 'programme', 'previously', 'opt', 'discontinue', 'production', 'rollsroyce', 'offer', 'powerplants', 'month', 'deliver', 'rollsroycepowered', 'civil', 'deliver', 'rollsroyce', 'main', 'revenue', 'stream', 'civil', 'however', 'derives', 'aftermarket', 'service', 'account', 'underlie', 'revenue', 'original', 'equipment', 'large', 'engine', 'sector', 'fleet', 'ground', 'mean', 'maintenance', 'service', 'business', 'model', 'start', 'break', 'flyinghour', 'receipt', 'begin', 'dry', 'impact', 'coronavirus', 'reflect', 'rollsroyce', 'share', 'price', 'fall', 'month', 'may', 'rollsroyce', 'furlough', 'around', 'personnel', 'governmentfunded', 'jobretention', 'scheme', 'intend', 'cover', 'immediate', 'impact', 'coronavirus', 'crisis', 'whereas', 'transport', 'industry', 'appear', 'likely', 'remain', 'cripple', 'chief', 'executive', 'warren', 'east', 'point', 'government', 'replace', 'demand', 'longer', 'exists', 'insists', 'emerge', 'troubled', 'achieve', 'incredible', 'thing', 'unite', 'union', 'unsurprisingly', 'express', 'shock', 'scale', 'broader', 'restructuring', 'argues', 'rollsroyce', 'step', 'back', 'brink', 'explore', 'alternative', 'meeting', 'come', 'day', 'convince', 'take', 'different', 'approach', 'press', 'government', 'step', 'plate', 'protect', 'manufacturing', 'base', 'say', 'assistant', 'general', 'secretary', 'manufacturing', 'steve', 'turner', 'state', 'uk', 'government', 'establish', 'national', 'council', 'recovery', 'work', 'personnel', 'representative']"
"As Malaysia Airlines parks nearly half of its fleet in long-term storage amid the coronavirus outbreak, its engineering unit has switched up its usual operations. For instance, various representatives from divisions within the unit – such as technical services, quality assurance, and maintenance control – have come together to form a “command centre” to marshall maintenance and repair resources for the period. Malaysia Airlines senior executive engineer for production, planning and control Chan Kin Ting says the engineering unit has had to “make a lot of ad hoc and prompt decisions” on the fly, because of uncertainty about the outbreak's impact. Malaysia Airlines has parked about half of its fleet of nearly 90 passenger aircraft at Kuala Lumpur international airport for the long-term, including its entire fleet of six Airbus A380s, as well as 29 Boeing 737-800s. Given the unprecedented number of parked aircraft, the engineering division – which has more than 1,990 staff across Malaysian airports – has grouped its line and base maintenance teams and divvied up the work according to tail number. Checks included as part of the long-term parking maintenance procedures include making sure the fuel tanks do not contain microbiological growth, and ensuring engine parts do not fall victim to Malaysia's humid weather. A group of 300-400 engineering staff have also been regrouped as maintenance “frontliners”. Their responsibilities deal primarily with line maintenance checks at its Kuala Lumpur hub, such as physical inspections of aircraft exteriors, and cabin equipment maintenance. Precautions put in place because of the pandemic mean that this group of staff are only allowed access into the aircraft cockpit, to limit exposure to any suspected cases, says Chan. The aircraft is then towed to a remote parking bay for checks and repair works to commence. Once the all-clear is given by the engineering command centre that no suspected infected persons was on the prior flight, the staff will enter the cabin to begin their defect checks. Chan says this process now takes longer than the usual practice, but declined to specify. Checks – and subsequent repair works – on an A330 can usually take about one to 1.5 hours, Chan notes, but that has since been extended as a result precautionary measures. Malaysia Airlines joins other carriers in and around the region, which have also had to tweak their maintenance workflow to cater to an unusually large number of stored aircraft. For instance, Middle Eastern giant Etihad Airways in April said it was working to bring forward maintenance checks of aircraft already grounded, and would be stepping up cabin and airframe maintenance during this period. Separately, Malaysia Airlines is also looking to expand the number of passenger-to-freighter flights during this period.

"The US Air Force (USAF) has lost two stealth fighters in one week during operations from Eglin AFB, Florida. The separate crashes involved a Lockheed Martin F-35A and an F-22, according to the service. An F-22 at Eglin AFB The F-35A crashed while landing at night on 19 May, while the F-22 was lost on 15 May during a training mission. In both instances the pilots ejected safely. Eglin AFB adds that the cause of the accidents will be investigated. Cirium fleets data indicates that prior to the F-22 crash, the USAF had 185 examples in service. Since the F-22's service entry, the service has had to write off four examples of the type, which is no longer in production. Prior to the 19 May Eglin crash the F-35 had suffered two losses. The first occurred in September 2018 when a US Marine Corps F-35B crashed in South Carolina. The pilot safely ejected. The F-35's second crash involved an F-35A operated by the Japan Air Self-Defence Force.

"Rolls-Royce is expecting to have to axe around 9,000 personnel – about 17% of its global workforce – in the aftermath of the economic downturn caused by the coronavirus outbreak. Its civil aerospace division will be “predominantly” affected, it says, following the severe deterioration of the air transport market. “We will carry out a detailed review of our facility footprint [in civil aerospace],” it adds. Rolls-Royce's defence business will not need to reduce staff numbers, says the company, although other operations are likely to be affected. “As part of the re-organisation, we will ensure that our internal civil aerospace supply chain continues to support our defence programmes,” it adds. Rolls-Royce says it will also “explore any opportunities” to move personnel to its defence division. The company says the loss of the staff will contribute £700 million to a broad re-organisation which will save around £1.3 billion per year. Rolls-Royce says it plans to cut expenditure across plants and property, capital and other indirect cost areas. Cash costs relating to the restructuring will probably be around £800 million, the company says, incurred over 2020-22. Rolls-Royce has yet to disclose which facilities or regions might be affected, as it needs to consult first with union representatives. “This is not a crisis of our making,” says chief executive Warren East. “But it is the crisis that we face and we must deal with it. “Our airline customers and airframe partners are having to adapt and so must we.” He says that governments are trying to assist businesses, but they “cannot replace sustainable customer demand that is simply not there”. Rolls-Royce says it has already taken actions to strengthen its finances and reduce cash expenditure in 2020. “It is, however, increasingly clear that activity in the commercial aerospace market will take several years to return to the levels seen just a few months ago,” it states. “We must now address these medium-term structural changes, as demand from customers reduces significantly for our civil aerospace engines and aftermarket services.”",5,154,2.0,0.2062,"executive, chief, cut, add, situation, staff, crisis, make, coronavirus, employee","['rollsroyce', 'expect', 'axe', 'around', 'personnel', 'global', 'workforce', 'aftermath', 'economic', 'downturn', 'cause', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'civil', 'division', 'predominantly', 'affected', 'say', 'follow', 'severe', 'deterioration', 'transport', 'market', 'carry', 'detailed', 'review', 'facility', 'footprint', 'civil', 'add', 'rollsroyce', 'defence', 'business', 'need', 'reduce', 'staff', 'number', 'say', 'although', 'operation', 'likely', 'affected', 'part', 'reorganisation', 'ensure', 'internal', 'civil', 'supply', 'chain', 'continue', 'support', 'defence', 'programme', 'add', 'rollsroyce', 'say', 'explore', 'opportunity', 'move', 'personnel', 'defence', 'division', 'say', 'loss', 'staff', 'contribute', 'broad', 'reorganisation', 'save', 'around', 'per', 'rollsroyce', 'say', 'plan', 'cut', 'expenditure', 'across', 'plant', 'property', 'capital', 'indirect', 'cost', 'area', 'cash', 'cost', 'relate', 'restructuring', 'probably', 'around', 'say', 'incur', 'rollsroyce', 'yet', 'disclose', 'facility', 'region', 'might', 'affected', 'need', 'consult', 'union', 'representative', 'crisis', 'make', 'say', 'chief', 'executive', 'warren', 'east', 'crisis', 'face', 'must', 'deal', 'customer', 'airframe', 'partner', 'adapt', 'must', 'say', 'government', 'try', 'assist', 'business', 'replace', 'sustainable', 'customer', 'demand', 'simply', 'rollsroyce', 'say', 'already', 'take', 'action', 'strengthen', 'finance', 'reduce', 'cash', 'expenditure', 'however', 'increasingly', 'clear', 'activity', 'commercial', 'market', 'take', 'several', 'return', 'level', 'see', 'month', 'ago', 'state', 'must', 'address', 'mediumterm', 'structural', 'change', 'demand', 'customer', 'reduces', 'significantly', 'civil', 'engine', 'aftermarket', 'service']"
"Lifting of Hawaii's blanket coronavirus quarantine order for all inbound travellers will be key to returning to normalcy for the airline, and the state, for which tourism is an essential industry, says Hawaiian Airlines chief executive Peter Ingram. Ingram, speaking via video at the Wolfe Transportation & Industrials Conference on 19 May, says Hawaii's strict quarantine order, in place since 26 March, is making it much more difficult for the Honolulu-based airline to calculate when it can begin to expand its network and rebuild to its pre-coronavirus schedule. All travellers to and between the islands are required to isolate for 14 days after arrival – a policy aimed at minimising the spread of coronavirus. Earlier this week, the order was extended until the end of June. “We really don't even know where demand is because the quarantine removes whatever demand there might be,” Ingram says. “I have some optimism that leisure travel will rebound better as we get through this crisis.” Video conferencing possibilities, he adds, “have proven to be useful tools for business, but I'm not sure this is the way people are going to want to take their next Hawaii vacation.” Hawaii hosts more than 9.4 million tourists annually, more than four times the total population of the state, a string of volcanic islands in the Pacific Ocean. Tourism comprises almost a quarter of the islands' economy. And in the past eight weeks the industry's virtual disappearance has led to an unemployment rate of more than 21%, the highest in the United States. Hawaiian Airlines is burning through $3.6 million daily, but wants to cut that to $3.1 million in the near future, Ingram adds. While the airline has seen a “noticeable” bump in bookings for later in the year, the increase comes off such a small base to be not truly meaningful. “We will see the quarantine for people travelling within the state removed first,” Ingram says. Due to consistent low case counts in the islands, this may even happen before the planned 30 June date. But with its tropical beaches and exotic flair, the islands draw visitors from all over the world. “There is a lot of concern...about where the people are travelling from,” Ingram says. “We are just as interested in what case counts look like in California, Washington, Oregon, Japan, Korea and Australia as we are here, because that's going to inform how people make their decisions locally.” The airline's normal operating schedule includes connections to all of those regions. It is the second-largest carrier of passengers and cargo between Hawaii and Japan, after Japan Air Lines. Hawaiian's interisland flights serve as the main transportation link between the different population centers within the archipelago, which lies about 2,500nm (4,500km) southwest of the US mainland. For these island hops of 100-250nm, the airline operates a fleet of Boeing 717s which can be cycled up to 16 times daily. Much of the clientele for these flights are locals, traveling to visit friends or family. Due to the quarantine order such trips have been severely curtailed. “Hawaiian is in a unique situation in that we are the entire highway system for the state,” Ingram says, adding that he expects to see pent up demand inter-island flights when the state relaxes restrictions.",5,155,5.0,0.2666,"carrier, march, international, outbreak, suspend, capacity, schedule, april, united, coronavirus","['lift', 'hawaii', 'blanket', 'coronavirus', 'quarantine', 'order', 'inbound', 'traveller', 'key', 'return', 'normalcy', 'state', 'tourism', 'essential', 'industry', 'say', 'hawaiian', 'chief', 'executive', 'peter', 'ingram', 'ingram', 'speak', 'via', 'video', 'wolfe', 'transportation', 'industrials', 'conference', 'may', 'say', 'hawaii', 'strict', 'quarantine', 'order', 'place', 'since', 'march', 'make', 'much', 'difficult', 'honolulubased', 'calculate', 'begin', 'expand', 'network', 'rebuild', 'precoronavirus', 'schedule', 'traveller', 'island', 'require', 'isolate', 'day', 'arrival', 'policy', 'aim', 'minimise', 'spread', 'coronavirus', 'earlier', 'week', 'order', 'extend', 'end', 'june', 'really', 'even', 'know', 'demand', 'quarantine', 'remove', 'whatever', 'demand', 'might', 'ingram', 'say', 'optimism', 'leisure', 'travel', 'rebound', 'well', 'get', 'video', 'conferencing', 'possibility', 'add', 'proven', 'useful', 'tool', 'business', 'sure', 'way', 'people', 'go', 'want', 'take', 'next', 'hawaii', 'hawaii', 'host', 'tourist', 'annually', 'total', 'population', 'state', 'string', 'volcanic', 'island', 'pacific', 'ocean', 'tourism', 'comprises', 'almost', 'quarter', 'island', 'economy', 'past', 'week', 'industry', 'virtual', 'disappearance', 'lead', 'unemployment', 'rate', 'high', 'united', 'state', 'hawaiian', 'burning', 'daily', 'want', 'cut', 'near', 'future', 'ingram', 'add', 'see', 'noticeable', 'bump', 'booking', 'later', 'increase', 'come', 'small', 'base', 'truly', 'meaningful', 'see', 'quarantine', 'people', 'travel', 'within', 'state', 'remove', 'ingram', 'say', 'due', 'consistent', 'low', 'case', 'count', 'island', 'may', 'even', 'happen', 'plan', 'june', 'date', 'tropical', 'beach', 'exotic', 'flair', 'island', 'draw', 'visitor', 'world', 'lot', 'concern', 'people', 'travel', 'ingram', 'say', 'interested', 'case', 'count', 'look', 'like', 'california', 'washington', 'oregon', 'japan', 'korea', 'australia', 'go', 'inform', 'people', 'make', 'decision', 'normal', 'operating', 'schedule', 'include', 'connection', 'region', 'secondlargest', 'carrier', 'passenger', 'cargo', 'hawaii', 'japan', 'japan', 'line', 'hawaiian', 'interisland', 'serve', 'main', 'transportation', 'link', 'different', 'population', 'center', 'within', 'archipelago', 'lie', 'southwest', 'u', 'mainland', 'island', 'hop', 'operates', 'fleet', 'cycle', 'daily', 'much', 'clientele', 'local', 'travel', 'visit', 'friend', 'family', 'due', 'quarantine', 'order', 'trip', 'severely', 'curtail', 'hawaiian', 'unique', 'situation', 'entire', 'highway', 'system', 'state', 'ingram', 'say', 'add', 'expect', 'see', 'pent', 'demand', 'interisland', 'state', 'relaxes', 'restriction']"
"South African carrier Comair's business rescue practitioners believe there is a reasonable chance of the Johannesburg-based airline's being saved. The airline's board opted to enter business rescue on 4 May. Practitioners Shaun Collyer and Richard Ferguson met with creditors and employees on 19 May to outline the carrier's position. They state that there are “reasonable prospects” for Comair to be rescued, pointing out that the airline is a “critical infrastructure asset” for the country, holding a 39% market share of domestic travel before the coronavirus crisis. Its assets exceed its liabilities but the grounding of the airline, as a result of the South African lockdown on 26 March, means it is unable to generate revenues and has insufficient cash to meet obligations. South Africa's government is to lift the lockdown in phases but Comair will not be able to restore domestic flights until several of these phases have been implemented. The rescue will involve restructuring the airline's business, debts and equity to maximise its chances of remaining solvent and continuing operations. Comair will depend on post-commencement finance in order to continue with the business rescue plan which is due to be published on 9 June, with a vote on 24 June. “Support of key stakeholders – namely the banks and lessors – for the business rescue process is therefore required,” the practitioners state. “Without it, we will have no choice but to place the company in liquidation.” Comair has suffered financially from the predicament of flag-carrier South African Airways, against which it had been awarded a R1.1 billion ($60 million) settlement in a competition case. The practitioners state that R790 million of this sum will be “unrecoverable” as a result of SAA's own filing for business rescue last December. Comair operates as a franchise partner for British Airways and also serves routes with the budget airline brand Kulula. South African air transport is experiencing a critical period as a result of SAA's and Comair's rescue, as well as the liquidation proceedings against regional operator SA Express.",5,156,8.0,0.4703,"government, uk, carrier, business, state, share, south, airway, financial, plan","['south', 'african', 'carrier', 'comair', 'business', 'rescue', 'practitioner', 'believe', 'reasonable', 'chance', 'johannesburgbased', 'save', 'board', 'opt', 'enter', 'business', 'rescue', 'may', 'practitioner', 'shaun', 'collyer', 'richard', 'ferguson', 'met', 'creditor', 'employee', 'may', 'outline', 'carrier', 'position', 'state', 'reasonable', 'prospect', 'comair', 'rescue', 'point', 'critical', 'infrastructure', 'asset', 'country', 'hold', 'market', 'share', 'domestic', 'travel', 'coronavirus', 'crisis', 'asset', 'exceed', 'liability', 'ground', 'result', 'south', 'african', 'lockdown', 'march', 'mean', 'unable', 'generate', 'revenue', 'insufficient', 'cash', 'meet', 'obligation', 'south', 'africa', 'government', 'lift', 'lockdown', 'phase', 'comair', 'able', 'restore', 'domestic', 'several', 'phase', 'implement', 'rescue', 'involve', 'restructuring', 'business', 'debt', 'equity', 'maximise', 'chance', 'remain', 'solvent', 'continue', 'operation', 'comair', 'depend', 'postcommencement', 'finance', 'order', 'continue', 'business', 'rescue', 'plan', 'due', 'publish', 'june', 'vote', 'june', 'support', 'key', 'stakeholder', 'namely', 'bank', 'lessor', 'business', 'rescue', 'process', 'therefore', 'require', 'practitioner', 'state', 'without', 'choice', 'place', 'comair', 'suffer', 'financially', 'predicament', 'flagcarrier', 'south', 'african', 'airway', 'award', 'settlement', 'competition', 'case', 'practitioner', 'state', 'sum', 'unrecoverable', 'result', 'saa', 'filing', 'business', 'rescue', 'december', 'comair', 'operates', 'franchise', 'partner', 'british', 'airway', 'serf', 'route', 'budget', 'brand', 'kulula', 'south', 'african', 'transport', 'experience', 'critical', 'period', 'result', 'saa', 'comair', 'rescue', 'well', 'liquidation', 'proceeding', 'regional', 'operator', 'sa', 'express']"
"South Africa's civil aviation regulator has been forced to defer ICAO audits, and postpone replacement of its lost flight-calibration aircraft, as a consequence of the coronavirus outbreak. The Civil Aviation Authority told a parliamentary transport portfolio committee on 18 May that it had drawn up three scenarios for the development of South African lockdown measures – adding that, in the worst case, it would generate no revenues except for fuel levy on cargo flights. In this worst-case scenario the authority would only have enough cash to sustain itself for seven months before the “drastic” measure of government assistance would be necessary, said director of civil aviation Poppy Khoza. A pessimistic scenario envisions a seven-month lockdown and a nine-month period of sustainability with an 84% fall in passenger numbers for the year, while the most optimistic outlook puts the lockdown at five months with a 77% fall and 10 months of cash reserves. While the government lowered the lockdown level on 1 May it still restricts all domestic and international passenger flights, with only cargo services permitted. A further lowering of the level would be required for a limited number of conditional domestic flights to restart. Khoza said expected ICAO follow-up audits would be deferred and, to save costs, capital expenditure would be pushed back for 12 months. This expenditure was set to include acquisition of a flight-inspection unit aircraft to replace the Cessna Citation II calibration jet lost in a fatal accident in January. One member of the committee queried when the aircraft would be replaced, stating that it was “sorely needed” and its absence would be an “additional burden” on the regulator. Although he acknowledged that there were plans to lease capacity in the meantime, he pointed out that “it's better to have your own” for security reasons.",5,157,8.0,0.165,"government, uk, carrier, business, state, share, south, airway, financial, plan","['south', 'africa', 'civil', 'regulator', 'force', 'defer', 'icao', 'audit', 'postpone', 'replacement', 'lose', 'flightcalibration', 'consequence', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'civil', 'authority', 'told', 'parliamentary', 'transport', 'portfolio', 'committee', 'may', 'drawn', 'scenario', 'development', 'south', 'african', 'lockdown', 'measure', 'add', 'bad', 'case', 'generate', 'revenue', 'except', 'fuel', 'levy', 'cargo', 'worstcase', 'scenario', 'authority', 'enough', 'cash', 'sustain', 'month', 'drastic', 'measure', 'government', 'assistance', 'necessary', 'say', 'director', 'civil', 'poppy', 'khoza', 'pessimistic', 'scenario', 'envisions', 'sevenmonth', 'lockdown', 'ninemonth', 'period', 'sustainability', 'fall', 'passenger', 'number', 'optimistic', 'outlook', 'put', 'lockdown', 'month', 'fall', 'month', 'cash', 'reserve', 'government', 'lower', 'lockdown', 'level', 'may', 'still', 'restricts', 'domestic', 'international', 'passenger', 'cargo', 'service', 'permit', 'far', 'lower', 'level', 'require', 'limited', 'number', 'conditional', 'domestic', 'restart', 'khoza', 'say', 'expect', 'icao', 'followup', 'audit', 'defer', 'save', 'cost', 'capital', 'expenditure', 'push', 'back', 'month', 'expenditure', 'set', 'include', 'acquisition', 'flightinspection', 'unit', 'replace', 'cessna', 'citation', 'ii', 'calibration', 'jet', 'lose', 'fatal', 'accident', 'january', 'member', 'committee', 'query', 'replace', 'state', 'sorely', 'need', 'absence', 'additional', 'burden', 'regulator', 'although', 'acknowledge', 'plan', 'lease', 'capacity', 'meantime', 'point', 'well', 'security', 'reason']"
"UK budget carrier EasyJet is contacting customers after a serious cybersecurity breach which resulted in access to the personal information of 9 million travellers. Credit card details of just over 2,200 customers were accessed, the airline admits, and it has taken action to contact all of them to offer support. The airline says it has recruited forensic specialists to investigate the attack which, it claims, originated from a “highly sophisticated source”. Some 9 million customers' travel and email information was accessed, it adds. EasyJet says it has “closed off” the unauthorised intrusion and notified the National Cyber Security Centre as well as the Information Commissioner's Office. “There is no evidence that any personal information of any nature has been misused,” it adds. But it is contacting the 9 million customers affected to advise of protective measures to minimise risk of fraud exposure. It aims to contact all of them within a week. “We would like to apologise to those customers who have been affected by this incident,” says chief executive Johan Lundgren. “We take the cyber security of our systems very seriously and have robust security measures in place to protect our customers' personal information. “However, this is an evolving threat as cyber attackers get ever more sophisticated.” Lundgren states that concern over the risk of fraud has risen during the coronavirus outbreak, and that EasyJet will advise customers to be particularly vigilant if they receive unsolicited communications. “Every business must continue to stay agile to stay ahead of the threat,” he adds. “We will continue to invest in protecting our customers, our systems, and our data.”",5,158,12.0,0.1419,"travel, government, country, coronavirus, measure, restriction, passenger, state, march, canada","['uk', 'budget', 'carrier', 'easyjet', 'contact', 'customer', 'serious', 'cybersecurity', 'breach', 'result', 'access', 'personal', 'information', 'traveller', 'credit', 'card', 'detail', 'customer', 'access', 'admits', 'take', 'action', 'contact', 'offer', 'support', 'say', 'recruit', 'forensic', 'specialist', 'investigate', 'attack', 'claim', 'originate', 'highly', 'sophisticated', 'source', 'customer', 'travel', 'email', 'information', 'access', 'add', 'easyjet', 'say', 'close', 'unauthorised', 'intrusion', 'notify', 'national', 'cyber', 'security', 'centre', 'well', 'information', 'commissioner', 'office', 'evidence', 'personal', 'information', 'nature', 'misuse', 'add', 'contact', 'customer', 'affected', 'advise', 'protective', 'measure', 'minimise', 'risk', 'fraud', 'exposure', 'aim', 'contact', 'within', 'week', 'like', 'apologise', 'customer', 'affected', 'incident', 'say', 'chief', 'executive', 'johan', 'lundgren', 'take', 'cyber', 'security', 'system', 'seriously', 'robust', 'security', 'measure', 'place', 'protect', 'customer', 'personal', 'information', 'however', 'evolve', 'threat', 'cyber', 'attacker', 'get', 'ever', 'lundgren', 'state', 'concern', 'risk', 'fraud', 'risen', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'easyjet', 'advise', 'customer', 'particularly', 'vigilant', 'receive', 'unsolicited', 'communication', 'every', 'business', 'must', 'continue', 'stay', 'agile', 'stay', 'ahead', 'threat', 'add', 'continue', 'invest', 'protect', 'customer', 'system', 'data']"
"Russian carrier Utair halved its pre-tax losses in the first quarter, despite initial effects from the coronavirus crisis, but the impact on the second quarter has yet to become clear. The financially-pressured carrier's passenger numbers in April were down by nearly 90%. Utair disclosed in early March that it was taking action in response to the coronavirus outbreak, reducing services to Milan, Vienna and Riga, but it has worked to open new connections within Russia using Boeing 737s and ATR 72s. It has also used Boeing 767-200 aircraft to operate freight supply flights to remote Russian regions, and conduct medical equipment shuttles from China. Utair's revenues for the three months to 31 March edged upwards to Rb10.53 billion ($145 million) despite the influence of the pandemic and the “massive closure” of foreign flights, the carrier's financial director Igor Petrov says. It cut expenditure by 9% to Rb11.55 billion by increasing fuel efficiency, optimising ground-handling and completing lease payments on 22 737s, the company adds. The airline's pre-tax loss halved to Rb1.67 billion, under local accounting standards, and its net loss was down 30% to Rb1.79 billion. Petrov says the airline wrote off tax assets at the end of last year, reducing net assets by Rb14.4 billion, to “objectively reflect” the state of its assets and liabilities. “In the situation of a market downturn due to coronavirus, it is important to show a realistic financial result in advance,” he says. Utair's balance sheet remains precarious. Its total liabilities of Rb98 billion exceed its total assets of Rb66 billion. Auditor EY remarked in the company's full-year financial statement that there was a “significant uncertainty” regarding its ability to trade as a going concern. It pointed out that the negative net assets of nearly Rb30 billion was lower than the minimum authorised figure for public joint-stock companies under federal law. Utair has been undergoing debt restructuring and says this process is continuing in co-operation with creditors. Russian federal air transport regulator Rosaviatsia has been considering applications from the country's carriers for coronavirus-related subsidies.

"Swiss plans to modify a fourth Boeing 777 for cargo-only flights as the Lufthansa subsidiary grows its intercontinental freight network. Under a new schedule effective since 15 May, Hong Kong, New York JFK and Mumbai have become new destinations served with multiple weekly frequencies, Swiss says. Previously, it operated cargo flights to Beijing, Chicago, Shanghai, Singapore, Tokyo and – since 12 May – Toronto. Chinese city Shenzhen is to be served from 22 May with 10 cargo flights, Swiss says. Its leisure sibling Edelweiss is operating weekly cargo flights to Johannesburg under the current schedule. Swiss says it will carry freight on the route from June, when the carrier plans to resume passenger flights to Johannesburg. The South African city is one of several intercontinental destinations that Swiss intends to resume serving with passenger aircraft from next month – others being Bangkok, Hong Kong, Mumbai, New York JFK, Newark, Singapore and Tokyo. In April, Swiss disclosed a plan to remove economy seats on three of its 777-300ERs to increase freight capacity. Now, preparations are under way for a fourth aircraft to adapted, Swiss says, noting that it operates all its cargo-only flights with 777s. Cirium fleets data shows that Edelweiss's long-haul operation is comprised of four Airbus A340-300s and two A330-300s. All but two of the carrier's A340s are listed as being in storage. Swiss says it has since March conducted more than 200 cargo-only flights with a total freight tonnage of more than 4,000t, mainly to carry medical supplies to Switzerland. Another 160 cargo flights are planned through to the end of June.

"Thai Airways International indicates that reform plans are still underway and dismisses recent bankruptcy rumours. “[Thai] has clarified that it has no intention to file for bankruptcy, responding to rumours [that] appeared in the news and online about the consensus of its board of directors meeting on 15 May 2020 to file for bankruptcy,” it said today in a statement that reflects a clarification submitted to the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET). “Thai's reform plan has been approved by [Thai's] board of directors on 17 April 2020 and presented to the State Enterprise Policy Office for consideration on 29 April 2020. The plan will soon be presented to the cabinet for further action.

In a letter to SET dated 13 May, Thai said that more than half of its total revenue comes from foreign branch offices. Covid-19-related travel restrictions and shut borders have made it challenging to prepare documents necessary to prepare the financial statements, which may include evidence of ticket sales and ticket refunds, per the auditor's request. “Therefore, there are limitations on access to information in searching, preparing and collecting accounting documents for the auditor's review.” Thai is 51% owned by the government and was already facing financial difficulties before the Covid-19 pandemic.

"South African Airways' rescue practitioners have been instructed to produce a formal business plan for airline within 25 days, after a parliamentary standing committee expressed dissatisfaction with a draft publication. The standing committee on public accounts is also seeking a full schedule of fees from the practitioners, their advisers, and others involved in the five-month effort to rescue the carrier which has become mired in political controversy. Committee chairman Mkhuleko Hlengwa – hosting a 15 May session over video link, made difficult by technical issues – said there was a need for “more interaction” with the practitioners. “The more they provide answers, the more questions arise,” he said. “It's a case of classical musical chairs. It's what has characterised the operation over the past five months. It's what has landed us with a R10 billion bill.” Committee members are to compile a list of questions to put to the practitioners and have set a 26 May deadline for responses. While the committee was provided with a draft rescue plan, it says the “late submission” meant the members “could not engage” with it, and the practitioners have been given 25 days to produce a formal plan. Practitioner Les Matuson acknowledged the committee's remarks and told its members that his team would “accelerate production of the business rescue plan”. SAA Group's draft full-year accounts to 31 March 2019, presented during the session, showed the company made a pre-tax loss of R5.09 billion ($274 million), on revenues of R27 billion. Its total liabilities of R27.4 billion were nearly twice its total assets. In a cash-flow diagram the practitioners showed the company had opening cash of R118 million when it entered business rescue, eight months later, on 5 December. This was supplemented by a R5.5 billion drawdown in post-commencement funding, as well as R5.3 billion in receipts plus around R280 million in VAT and charter revenues. Minister Pravin Gordhan (inset) is seeking to establish a successor to SAA Public enterprises minister Pravin Gordhan told the committee that creditors and employees were informed at various stages that SAA “would be rescuable”, and that under legislation the practitioners would normally have to produce a business rescue plan within 25 days, subject to possible extensions. “No-one anticipated an extension of five months,” he said. The practitioners pointed out to the committee that they did not have specific experience in turning around distressed airlines, and recruited specialist Alvarez & Marsal which had expertise in the field, and a presentation of restructuring options was made to the department of public enterprises and the treasury in mid-December 2019. According to a timetable given to the committee, further analysis and presentations followed in early January 2020 and, in mid-January, the practitioners were advised that the government supported an option to restructure SAA through a new financially-sustainable holding company, preserving around 5,000 jobs. This option would cost around R7.7 billion, the practitioners informed the committee, as a result of creditor repayments, retrenchment costs for SAA and its subsidiaries, recapitalisation, and restructuring expenses. The practitioners also approached the Development Bank of South Africa in January for funding. The timetable indicates that initial post-commencement funding of R2 billion, granted as the airline entered business rescue, had been exhausted within a few days, and the Development Bank agreed in January to loan R3.5 billion. The bank had also expressed interest in acquiring SAA low-cost carrier Mango, maintenance arm SAA Technical, and possibly the frequent-flyer division Voyager. With the “breathing space” of the loan, the timetable states, the practitioners were granted an end-March extension to publish a business rescue plan, and intended to produce a draft plan for the week of 16 March. The committee was informed that the practitioners had carried out cash-management initiatives including renegotiation of contracts – yielding up to 40% discounts on aircraft leases – cancellation of duplicate and non-essential services, and suspension of onerous provisions. Suspension of loss-making routes was also imposed from early February, in line with the restructuring option chosen by the government, and in March a retrenchment process started. But the coronavirus outbreak in South Africa coincided with the proposed business plan publication date and forced a rethink on the funding requirements and the strategy for SAA's operations. The government subsequently declared it would not support extending foreign currency borrowing limits to permit foreign financing of the rescue plan, nor would it back a care-and-maintenance budget, and was unable to provide any additional funding to the business rescue process. By the end of April, the practitioners told the committee, the five-month rescue plan had cost more than R9.98 billion, including R1.9 billion on fuel, nearly R1.3 billion on salaries, R1.2 billion on aircraft leases, some R1.2 billion on services from regional carrier Airlink, and R929 million on SAA Technical. “Resilience and ability of an airline to survive is predicated on ability to access significant cash reserves and strong balance sheets,” the practitioners told the committee. “SAA has neither.” While the practitioners have been pursuing a wind-down of SAA and retrenchment of personnel, in the absence of continued funding, Pravin Gordhan has sought to engage with unions, who have objected to the retrenchment, to draw up plans for a successor airline. “[The government] is very aware that this business rescue process needed to be concluded a long time ago,” he told the committee. “And, most importantly, that what we require as an outcome of this process is the initial objective of a viable airline, retaining as many workers as we could and saving as many jobs as we could – which is quite important in the current economic context – but also making this airline non-reliant upon the fiscus.” South Africa's opposition party, the Democratic Alliance, is accusing Gordhan of trying to “short-circuit” the business rescue and is insisting that he “shelves” any plans for a new airline unless it is clear that it would be privately-owned and not state-funded. “The South African taxpayer does not deserve to be saddled with another state-funded airline when evidence clearly shows that it will also be another fiscal drag just like its predecessor,” the party states. “Gordhan should not be allowed to sacrifice the country's financial well-being through regressive plans of trying to appease unions by promising them a new airline. South Africa cannot afford it.” SAA's business rescue practitioners are warning that an alternative airline needs to demonstrate to lenders or investors an ability to manage increased exposure, adding that SAA, in its current state, “cannot demonstrate this”.",5,162,8.0,0.5299,"government, uk, carrier, business, state, share, south, airway, financial, plan","['south', 'african', 'airway', 'rescue',

"India is taking a more cautious approach than neighbouring Pakistan, which is looking to restart air travel. There will be no commercial flights in India until at least June, after the government extended a lockdown until the end of this month. A circular posted on the official Twitter account of India's Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) says both domestic and international flights will now be banned up until 31 May, 23:59. India's previous lockdown extension and flight ban was due to end yesterday. This is now the third time the lockdown has been extended. The restrictions do not apply to international all-cargo operations, nor to “flights specifically approved by DGCA”. “However, it is once again reiterated that foreign and domestic airlines shall be suitably informed about the opening of their operations whether international to/from India or domestic respectively in due course,” DGCA says in the circular. Meanwhile, Pakistan started allowing some domestic flights from 16 May, “in view of difficulties being faced by passengers in travelling between major cities in Pakistan”. Flights with limited load factors are being allowed from five major airports, including Islamabad, Karachi, Lahore, Peshawar and Quetta, according to a circular published on Twitter by the Aviation Division of Pakistan. Local carriers Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) andSerene Airwill operate the flights, and the Aviation Division has stipulated several protective measures against the coronavirus. Aircraft must be disinfected before boarding, there must be at least one vacant seat between passengers, and it is compulsory to wear masks and use hand sanitiser. No food and beverages will be allowed during flights. In addition, airlines are required to maintain “emergency PPE [personal protective equipment]” in the aircraft to deal with in-flight health emergencies, while all passengers must fill out a health declaration form before boarding. Pakistan, with a population of around 212 million, has 42,125 confirmed coronavirus cases, including 903 deaths, as at 18 May, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.

"Ryanair Group is forecasting a loss of more than €200 million for the first quarter, double the figure it estimated at the beginning of May, with a smaller loss in the second. The company is forecasting that it will transport fewer than 80 million passengers for the fiscal year 2020-21 – about half the number originally expected. Ryanair Group has turned in a full-year net profit of €649 million for 2019-20, after it took an exceptional charge of €353 million for fuel hedging ineffectiveness. Grounding of the fleet as a consequence of government coronavirus pandemic restrictions reduced the company's net profit by more than €40 million, it adds. The overall profit figure was down by more than a quarter on the previous year's €885 million. Without the exceptional charge, says the company, its profit would have exceeded €1 billion, as revenues rose by 10% to €8.5 billion. Ryanair Group warns that the current financial year will be “difficult” as it embarks on discussions on base closures and up to 3,000 job losses primarily affecting pilots and cabin crew. It has not given any guidance on net profit for the year, citing the uncertainty over the duration and impact of the pandemic and “no visibility” on customer behaviour and demand following return to service.

"Singapore Airlines has confirmed that it will accelerate the retirement of its remaining Boeing 777-200ERs owing to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. The airline says that its last three examples were recently moved to Asia Pacific Aircraft Storage in Alice Springs, Australia. Original plans had called for the type to be retired from its fleet this year. “Due to the significant drop in demand as a result of the Covid-19 outbreak the retirement of these aircraft have been brought forward and they will not be returning to operation for Singapore Airlines,” says the airline. The carrier's last three 777-200ERs bear the registrations 9V-SVB (MSN 28525), 9V-SVC (MSN 28526), and 9V-SVE (MSN 30870). Cirium fleets data shows that all three of the Rolls-Royce Trent 800 powered jets were delivered in 2001. The 777-200ER was formerly the workhorse of the SIA fleet. The airline received its first four examples in 1997, and operated a peak of 46 777-200ERs from 2004-2009. During this period, it was the most numerous type in the SIA fleet. In 2004, the 777-200ER accounted for 52% of the SIA fleet. In the 2000s, SIA was one of the largest operators of the type. In 2004-2005 SIA's 46 777-200ERs cast it as the world's second biggest operator after United Airlines, which then operated 52 examples. If all variants of the 777 are considered, SIA was the family's biggest operator from 2004-2008. Cirium fleets data shows that SIA's remaining 777 fleet comprises 27 777-300ERs and five 777-300s. The carrier has orders for 20 777-9s. Similar to other airlines globally, SIA has been hard hit by the flight restrictoins stemming from the coronavirus pandemic.  During the month of April, Group ASKs fell 96.3%, and on 14 May it posted a net loss of S$212 million ($149 million) for the 12 months ended 31 March - the first net loss in its history.",5,165,3.0,0.2087,"passenger, loss, operating, revenue, traffic, month, increase, capacity, decline, result","['singapore', 'confirm', 'accelerate', 'retirement', 'remain', 'owe', 'impact', 'coronavirus', 'pandemic', 'say', 'example', 'recently', 'move', 'asia', 'pacific', 'storage', 'alice', 'spring', 'australia', 'original', 'plan', 'call', 'type', 'retire', 'fleet', 'due', 'significant', 'drop', 'demand', 'result', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'retirement', 'brought', 'forward', 'return', 'operation', 'singapore', 'say', 'carrier', 'bear', 'registration', 'msn', 'msn', 'msn', 'fleet', 'data', 'rollsroyce', 'trent', 'power', 'jet', 'deliver', 'formerly', 'workhorse', 'sia', 'fleet', 'receive', 'example', 'operate', 'peak', 'period', 'numerous', 'type', 'sia', 'fleet', 'account', 'sia', 'fleet', 'sia', 'large', 'operator', 'type', 'sia', 'cast', 'world', 'second', 'big', 'operator', 'united', 'operate', 'example', 'variant', 'consider', 'sia', 'family', 'big', 'operator', 'fleet', 'data', 'sia', 'remain', 'fleet', 'comprises', 'carrier', 'order', 'similar', 'globally', 'sia', 'hard', 'hit', 'restrictoins', 'stem', 'coronavirus', 'pandemic', 'month', 'april', 'asks', 'fell', 'may', 'post', 'net', 'loss', 'month', 'end', 'march', 'net', 'loss', 'history']"
"A Canadair CT-114 Tutor trainer operated by the Royal Canadian Air Force's Snowbirds team has crashed during a demonstration routine. The accident occurred during the late morning of 17 May, the service says. One crew member was killed and another was injured, the air force says. Media reports from the site of the crash report that a house was set ablaze. Social media shows a pair of CT-114s performing a low pass over a group of observers. One pulls up into a high left bank. After gaining some altitude it abruptly pitches left and dives to the ground. Two crew members ejected seconds before impact. An image on a Canadian news report showed an orange and white parachute draped over a house. Media reports indicate that the performance had been delayed from earlier in the morning owing to weather. The sky in the crash footage is still overcast. In late April, the display team, which operates with a nine-aircraft formation, announced that it would travel the country performing flying displays to salute Canada's efforts in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Designed in the 1960s, the CT-114 was Canada's primary trainer until its replacement by the Textron Beechcraft T-6 (designated CT-156 in Canada) and the BAE Systems Hawk (designated CT-155). The CT-114 is powered by a single General Electric J85 turbojet that was locally produced by former Canadian firm Orenda Engines. This is the second Snowbirds crash within a year. At a show in Atlanta, Georgia in October 2019, Snowbird 5 was forced to eject after losing thrust at low altitude. The pilot suffered minor injuries, but the aircraft was destroyed.",5,166,1.0,0.2414,"test, force, helicopter, fire, system, service, attack, design, usaf, missile","['canadair', 'tutor', 'trainer', 'operate', 'royal', 'canadian', 'force', 'snowbird', 'team', 'crashed', 'demonstration', 'routine', 'accident', 'occur', 'late', 'morning', 'may', 'service', 'say', 'crew', 'member', 'kill', 'another', 'injured', 'force', 'say', 'medium', 'report', 'site', 'crash', 'report', 'house', 'set', 'ablaze', 'social', 'medium', 'pair', 'perform', 'low', 'pas', 'observer', 'pull', 'high', 'left', 'bank', 'gain', 'altitude', 'abruptly', 'pitch', 'left', 'dive', 'ground', 'crew', 'member', 'eject', 'second', 'impact', 'image', 'canadian', 'news', 'report', 'orange', 'white', 'parachute', 'draped', 'house', 'medium', 'report', 'indicate', 'performance', 'delayed', 'earlier', 'morning', 'owe', 'weather', 'sky', 'crash', 'footage', 'still', 'overcast', 'late', 'april', 'display', 'team', 'operates', 'nineaircraft', 'formation', 'announce', 'travel', 'country', 'perform', 'fly', 'display', 'salute', 'canada', 'effort', 'response', 'coronavirus', 'pandemic', 'design', 'canada', 'primary', 'trainer', 'replacement', 'textron', 'beechcraft', 'designate', 'canada', 'bae', 'system', 'hawk', 'designate', 'power', 'single', 'general', 'electric', 'turbojet', 'locally', 'produce', 'former', 'canadian', 'firm', 'orenda', 'engine', 'second', 'snowbird', 'crash', 'within', 'atlanta', 'georgia', 'october', 'snowbird', 'force', 'eject', 'lose', 'thrust', 'low', 'altitude', 'pilot', 'suffer', 'minor', 'injury', 'destroyed']"
"After being hit hard by the coronavirus outbreak at the start of the year, China's three largest carriers saw some degree of recovery in domestic traffic for April – even while their international networks continue to suffer steep declines. Of the three, only Air China saw fewer domestic passengers for the month, carrying 2.65 million passengers, a 4.2% month-on-month drop. China Southern and China Eastern Airlines both reported higher numbers of passengers carried on their respective domestic networks. China Southern carried 3.83 million passengers for the period, a 6.1% month-on-month increase, while China Eastern reported a 25% increase in domestic passengers carried, at 2.64 million passengers. However, the three carriers all carried far fewer domestic passengers year on year, with decreases of between 62% to 70%. On capacity, only China Eastern saw a month-on-month increase in its domestic network, with ASKs for the month rising about 8.7%. China Southern reported a 3% drop in domestic ASKs, while Air China saw a 13.5% month-on-month decrease. Domestic RPKs for April told a similar story, with China Eastern seeing a 21.7% increase compared to March, and China Southern reporting a 3.7% increase. Air China, meanwhile, saw domestic RPKs fall 5.2% month on month. Domestic passenger load factors across the three carriers rose for the month, hovering between 64.5% to 66.8%. All carriers reported increases of 4.1 to 7 percentage points. Across March and April, China gradually lifted travel restrictions for domestic travel, with carriers slowly reintroducing capacity into their domestic networks. Despite some bright spots in their domestic networks, the 'Big Three' still suffered from weakened demand in their international network, in part due to travel restrictions imposed globally. China Southern carried just 29,700 passengers internationally for the month, 78% lower than in March, and a 98.2% year-on-year drop. Air China carried 15,300 passengers across its international network, a drop of nearly 90% month on month, and a 99% year-on-year decline. As for China Eastern, it carried 17,600 passengers for the month. This was 87% lower month on month, and nearly 99% lower year on year. The three carriers saw huge month-on-month drops in international ASKs and RPKs for the month. International passenger load factors remained depressed, hovering below 50% across the three airlines. The impact of the coronavirus outbreak led to the three carriers turning to the red for the quarter ended 31 March, with all of them warning of steeper losses in the coming quarters.",5,167,3.0,0.6299,"passenger, loss, operating, revenue, traffic, month, increase, capacity, decline, result","['hit', 'hard', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'start', 'large', 'carrier', 'saw', 'degree', 'recovery', 'domestic', 'traffic', 'april', 'even', 'international', 'network', 'continue', 'suffer', 'steep', 'decline', 'saw', 'domestic', 'passenger', 'month', 'carry', 'passenger', 'monthonmonth', 'drop', 'southern', 'eastern', 'report', 'high', 'number', 'passenger', 'carry', 'respective', 'domestic', 'network', 'southern', 'carry', 'passenger', 'period', 'monthonmonth', 'increase', 'eastern', 'report', 'increase', 'domestic', 'passenger', 'carry', 'passenger', 'however', 'carrier', 'carry', 'far', 'domestic', 'passenger', 'decrease', 'capacity', 'eastern', 'saw', 'monthonmonth', 'increase', 'domestic', 'network', 'asks', 'month', 'rise', 'southern', 'report', 'drop', 'domestic', 'asks', 'saw', 'monthonmonth', 'decrease', 'domestic', 'rpks', 'april', 'told', 'similar', 'story', 'eastern', 'see', 'increase', 'compare', 'march', 'southern', 'reporting', 'increase', 'meanwhile', 'saw', 'domestic', 'rpks', 'fall', 'month', 'month', 'domestic', 'passenger', 'load', 'factor', 'across', 'carrier', 'rise', 'month', 'hover', 'carrier', 'report', 'increase', 'percentage', 'point', 'across', 'march', 'april', 'gradually', 'lift', 'travel', 'restriction', 'domestic', 'travel', 'carrier', 'slowly', 'reintroduce', 'capacity', 'domestic', 'network', 'despite', 'bright', 'spot', 'domestic', 'network', 'still', 'suffer', 'weaken', 'demand', 'international', 'network', 'part', 'due', 'travel', 'restriction', 'impose', 'globally', 'southern', 'carry', 'passenger', 'internationally', 'month', 'low', 'march', 'yearonyear', 'drop', 'carry', 'passenger', 'across', 'international', 'network', 'drop', 'nearly', 'month', 'month', 'yearonyear', 'decline', 'eastern', 'carry', 'passenger', 'month', 'low', 'month', 'month', 'nearly', 'low', 'carrier', 'saw', 'huge', 'monthonmonth', 'drop', 'international', 'asks', 'rpks', 'month', 'international', 'passenger', 'load', 'factor', 'remain', 'depressed', 'hover', 'across', 'impact', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'lead', 'carrier', 'turn', 'red', 'quarter', 'end', 'march', 'warn', 'steeper', 'loss', 'come', 'quarter']"
"The Singapore Airlines Group saw all passenger traffic metrics crash in April 2020 as the coronavirus pandemic brought world travel to a virtual standstill. The group says that overall capacity as measured by ASKs fell 96.3%, while passengers carried fell 99.6% to just 10,800, compared with 3.1 million a year earlier. The Group load factor fell 74.4 percentage points to 9.1%. The dismal performance was roughly equivalent across the main SIA carrier, Silkair, and low-cost unit Scoot. “[Mainline carrier] SIA's capacity was 95.5% lower compared to last year's, with only a skeletal network in operation connecting Singapore to 14 metro cities,” it says. “Passenger carriage declined 99.5%, resulting in a [passenger load factor] of 9.3%.” Cargo was a relative bright spot, although capacity as measured by metric tonne kilometres dropped 64.7%. Freight carried dropped 60.6%, but cargo load factor (CLF) for the month rose 17.5 percentage points to 75.6% as the decline in capacity outstripped the supply in demand. “[Cargo] capacity contraction would have been much greater, save for the deployment of passenger aircraft on cargo-only flights.

"South Korea's Asiana Airlines is bringing forward maintenance schedules, while it hunkers down during the Covid-19 crisis. As a result of aircraft groundings, the carrier was able to advance planned maintenance by about 17% in preparation for the return of air travel, it says in a discussion of its first-quarter performance. Asiana is also extending executive pay cuts indefinitely while all employees have been asked to take mandatory unpaid leave as part of what it describes as “self-help measures”. It says it will focus on chartered flights for repatriation while actively pursuing the corporate travel segment, having observed major countries easing travel restrictions to allow resumption of economic activities. Within its scheduled operations, it plans to resume service on 13 international routes starting June, to the USA, China and Southeast Asia. The airline will operate at 17% of planned capacity, with 110 weekly operations. It has also increased air freight operations to make up for lost belly-cargo capacity. Asiana currently operates to China, Southeast Asia, the USA and Europe and says it is continuously expanding in this area. In the January-March period, Asiana's revenue declined by 22% to W1.13 trillion ($917 million) due to the sharp fall in demand for air travel globally. The airline reported a W208 billion operating loss, a widening of a W11.8 billion reverse in the first quarter of 2019. The net loss came in at W549 billion, up from W84.3 billion in the year-ago period. It says: “Asiana Airlines plans to continue its intensive self-help plan to survive as Covid-19 [is now a] global pandemic and passenger demand is expected to contract for some time.”",5,169,3.0,0.1832,"passenger, loss, operating, revenue, traffic, month, increase, capacity, decline, result","['south', 'korea', 'asiana', 'bring', 'forward', 'maintenance', 'schedule', 'hunkers', 'coronavirus', 'crisis', 'result', 'grounding', 'carrier', 'able', 'advance', 'plan', 'maintenance', 'preparation', 'return', 'travel', 'say', 'discussion', 'firstquarter', 'performance', 'asiana', 'extend', 'executive', 'pay', 'cut', 'indefinitely', 'employee', 'ask', 'take', 'mandatory', 'unpaid', 'leave', 'part', 'describes', 'selfhelp', 'measure', 'say', 'focus', 'charter', 'repatriation', 'actively', 'pursue', 'corporate', 'travel', 'segment', 'observe', 'major', 'country', 'ease', 'travel', 'restriction', 'allow', 'resumption', 'economic', 'activity', 'within', 'schedule', 'operation', 'plan', 'resume', 'service', 'international', 'route', 'start', 'june', 'usa', 'southeast', 'asia', 'operate', 'plan', 'capacity', 'weekly', 'operation', 'increase', 'freight', 'operation', 'make', 'lose', 'bellycargo', 'capacity', 'asiana', 'currently', 'operates', 'southeast', 'asia', 'usa', 'europe', 'say', 'continuously', 'expand', 'area', 'januarymarch', 'period', 'asiana', 'revenue', 'decline', 'trillion', 'due', 'sharp', 'fall', 'demand', 'travel', 'globally', 'report', 'operating', 'loss', 'widen', 'reverse', 'quarter', 'net', 'loss', 'come', 'yearago', 'period', 'say', 'asiana', 'plan', 'continue', 'intensive', 'selfhelp', 'plan', 'survive', 'coronavirus', 'global', 'pandemic', 'passenger', 'demand', 'expect', 'contract']"
"South African Airways' business rescue practitioners spent R9.9 billion ($532 million) in the five months after they were called upon to try to save the loss-making airline. Testifying by video link to a parliamentary committee on 15 May, practitioner Siviwe Dongwana stated that the sum was used between 5 December last year – when the airline was placed in business rescue – and the end of April 2020. The expenditure included 16% on salaries and 20% on fuel Dongwana said, with other costs including 12% on aircraft leasing and 12% in payments to regional operator Airlink for flights. Department of public enterprises minister Pravin Gordhan also laid out to the committee the huge expense allocated to SAA since its 2003-04 financial year, putting the figure at over R31.2 billion in cash injections plus R19.1 billion in guarantees. He said that a draft business rescue plan had been given to the department on 5 May, but added that – after consultation with advisers – it was “found to be extremely deficient”. Gordhan's relationship with the rescue practitioners has been fractious and the department has sought co-operation from SAA's eight recognised unions, as well as aviation specialists, to draw up the framework of an airline which could operate under the constraints of a post-coronavirus environment. “In the last week or so [the unions] have made an important contribution to the rescue process and emergence of an alternative [airline] by undertaking a salary sacrifice which hadn't been done for five months,” Gordhan stated. “[We're] currently working with them on a social plan for those people who will not be accommodated.” He told the committee that the department had received offers to purchase SAA assets. “But at this point in time we don't know how to differentiate between what is genuine and what isn't,” he said. SAA business rescue practitioner Les Matuson, in remarks to the committee, appeared keen to avoid friction, crediting Gordhan with having a “consistent” vision, throughout the process, of creating a new and sustainable operation, despite the difficulties. Matuson also explained why he was reluctant to pursue a liquidation of SAA, after warning that it was one of two bleak options – the other being a wind-down – after the government refused to fund the rescue further. “The liquidation process is a very, very destructive one,” he said. “Liquidation generally just sows chaos.” He says liquidation would take two or three years and would probably result in the loss of air operator's certificates, slots and licences, with a limited return. “In liquidation the whole staff complement would be unemployed. It's got a lot of implications,” Matuson added. “There's not a question of doubt in my mind that a liquidation process would materially erode value and net recoveries for creditors could be an absolute disaster. We would not recommend liquidation in a hurry to anybody.”",5,170,8.0,0.488,"government, uk, carrier, business, state, share, south, airway, financial, plan","['south', 'african', 'airway', 'business', 'rescue', 'practitioner', 'spent', 'month', 'call', 'upon', 'try', 'save', 'lossmaking', 'testify', 'video', 'link', 'parliamentary', 'committee', 'may', 'practitioner', 'siviwe', 'dongwana', 'state', 'sum', 'use', 'december', 'place', 'business', 'rescue', 'end', 'april', 'expenditure', 'include', 'salary', 'fuel', 'dongwana', 'say', 'cost', 'include', 'lease', 'payment', 'regional', 'operator', 'airlink', 'department', 'public', 'enterprise', 'minister', 'pravin', 'gordhan', 'laid', 'committee', 'huge', 'expense', 'allocate', 'saa', 'since', 'financial', 'put', 'figure', 'cash', 'injection', 'plus', 'guarantee', 'say', 'draft', 'business', 'rescue', 'plan', 'give', 'department', 'may', 'add', 'consultation', 'adviser', 'found', 'extremely', 'deficient', 'gordhan', 'relationship', 'rescue', 'practitioner', 'fractious', 'department', 'sought', 'cooperation', 'saa', 'recognise', 'union', 'well', 'specialist', 'draw', 'framework', 'operate', 'constraint', 'postcoronavirus', 'environment', 'week', 'union', 'make', 'important', 'contribution', 'rescue', 'process', 'emergence', 'alternative', 'undertaking', 'salary', 'sacrifice', 'month', 'gordhan', 'state', 'currently', 'work', 'social', 'plan', 'people', 'told', 'committee', 'department', 'receive', 'offer', 'purchase', 'saa', 'asset', 'point', 'know', 'differentiate', 'genuine', 'say', 'saa', 'business', 'rescue', 'practitioner', 'le', 'matuson', 'remark', 'committee', 'appear', 'keen', 'avoid', 'friction', 'credit', 'gordhan', 'consistent', 'vision', 'throughout', 'process', 'create', 'sustainable', 'operation', 'despite', 'difficulty', 'matuson', 'explain', 'reluctant', 'pursue', 'liquidation', 'saa', 'warn', 'bleak', 'option', 'winddown', 'government', 'refuse', 'fund', 'rescue', 'far', 'liquidation', 'process', 'destructive', 'say', 'liquidation', 'generally', 'sow', 'say', 'liquidation', 'take', 'probably', 'result', 'loss', 'operator', 'certificate', 'slot', 'licence', 'limited', 'return', 'liquidation', 'whole', 'staff', 'complement', 'unemployed', 'get', 'lot', 'implication', 'matuson', 'add', 'question', 'doubt', 'mind', 'liquidation', 'process', 'materially', 'erode', 'value', 'net', 'recovery', 'creditor', 'absolute', 'disaster', 'recommend', 'liquidation', 'hurry', 'anybody']"
"Ryanair has axed more than 250 office-based jobs at four locations and will this month announce details of its plan to slash up to 3,000 crew positions. The Irish budget carrier says it has reduced its office headcount in Dublin,Stansted, Madrid and Wroclaw by over 250, “through a combination of probation/fixed term contract ends, resignations and redundancies”. Ryanair has determined that “these people will not be required to return to work” when its offices reopen on 1 June, as a result of the “substantial decline in traffic” the group's airlines are facing in 2020. “Regrettably, we will now have a small number of compulsory redundancies in Dublin, Stansted, Madrid and Wroclaw to right-size our support teams for a year when we will carry less than 100 million passengers due to the Covid-19 crisis,” states Ryanair people director Darrell Hughes. He adds that the airline continues to meet with its pilot and cabin-crew unions to finalise up to 3,000 job cuts and a 20% reduction in pay, ahead of a plan to resume 40% of its flight schedule from July.

"Korean Air has revealed a W56.6 billion ($46 million) first-quarter operating loss but says the “relatively mild” figure was mitigated by lower operating costs. Revenue for the period fell 22.7% year on year, to W2.35 trillion, alongside a 14% decline in operating costs, among them lower fuel and payroll expenses. Revenue passenger kilometres declined 29.5% “due to the drastic reduction of passenger demand across all routes”, which also lowered cargo capacity. Despite that, Korean reported a 3.1% increase in freight tonne kilometres, owing to increased cargo operations, improved load factors and the use of passenger jets as freighters. Net loss widened to W692 billion for the period, from a loss of W89.4 billion in the first quarter of 2019. It cited W376 billion in foreign exchange losses as one of the factors that pushed it deeper into the red. Korean is expecting further losses in the current quarter “due to the prolonged Covid-19 environment”. It expects the USA and some European countries to resume domestic travel and ease travel restrictions which will help mitigate its revenue losses, though it emphasises “absolutely safety and efficient aircraft operations”. The airline sees further supply shortage in the cargo market throughout the second quarter due to the global reduction and suspension of passenger flights but views this as an opportunity. “This capacity shortage will enable Korean Air to continue its profitable operations in its cargo business,” it says.",5,172,3.0,0.3852,"passenger, loss, operating, revenue, traffic, month, increase, capacity, decline, result","['korean', 'reveal', 'firstquarter', 'operating', 'loss', 'say', 'relatively', 'mild', 'figure', 'mitigate', 'low', 'operating', 'cost', 'revenue', 'period', 'fell', 'trillion', 'alongside', 'decline', 'operating', 'cost', 'among', 'low', 'fuel', 'payroll', 'expense', 'revenue', 'passenger', 'kilometre', 'decline', 'due', 'drastic', 'reduction', 'passenger', 'demand', 'across', 'route', 'lower', 'cargo', 'capacity', 'despite', 'korean', 'report', 'increase', 'freight', 'tonne', 'kilometre', 'owe', 'increase', 'cargo', 'operation', 'improve', 'load', 'factor', 'use', 'passenger', 'jet', 'freighter', 'net', 'loss', 'widen', 'period', 'loss', 'quarter', 'cite', 'foreign', 'exchange', 'loss', 'factor', 'push', 'deeper', 'red', 'korean', 'expect', 'far', 'loss', 'current', 'quarter', 'due', 'prolong', 'coronavirus', 'environment', 'expect', 'usa', 'european', 'country', 'resume', 'domestic', 'travel', 'ease', 'travel', 'restriction', 'help', 'mitigate', 'revenue', 'loss', 'though', 'emphasis', 'absolutely', 'safety', 'efficient', 'operation', 'see', 'far', 'supply', 'shortage', 'cargo', 'market', 'throughout', 'second', 'quarter', 'due', 'global', 'reduction', 'suspension', 'passenger', 'view', 'opportunity', 'capacity', 'shortage', 'enable', 'korean', 'continue', 'profitable', 'operation', 'cargo', 'business', 'say']"
"Singapore Airlines will fully phase out the older aircraft types in its fleet - such as the Boeing 777-200ER and Airbus A330-300 - within a year, but declines to say whether the retirement of the widebodies has been accelrated byt the coronavirus outbreak. At a briefing following the release of its full-year results, SIA senior vice-president finance Stephen Barnes says the carrier is not expecting over the short- or medium-term “to recover the full [levels of service] as we had” before the pandemic. On that basis it “will not need the same sized fleet that we had”, he adds. The older 777s in its inventory, such as the -200ERs, “will leave the fleet a little earlier, certainly by the end of this financial year”, Barnes adds. Cirium fleets data indicates the carrier has seven 777-200ERs and five -300s, which are between 16 and 19 years old. Of these, only three 777-300s are currently in operation. SIA will also remove its fleet of nine leased A330-300s. “[They] are due to leave the fleet in the next 12 to 14 months and we will not be extending the leases,” says Barnes. The carrier gives no detailed timeline on the phasing out of the older aircraft, and does not confirm rumours that the 777-200ERs have been prematurely retired during the outbreak. SIA is coy about whether the Star Alliance carrier would consider retiring any of its 19 A380s, as some other operators have done so Chief executive Goh Choon Phong says: “The shape of recovery in this particular crisis is still uncertain. We have flexibility around our fleet, and we will look at what we need to do in terms of matching fleet requirements and market outlook.” SIA adds that it is still negotiating with Airbus and Boeing “to adjust the delivery stream for aircraft orders placed in the past”, but gives no further details. In recent weeks, carriers in North America and Europe have accelerated retirement of older aircraft, in light of collapsed travel demand brought about by the outbreak.

"Israeli flag-carrier El Al has yet to take delivery of its final Boeing 787, while the airline shuffles its current fleet as part of efforts to reduce cash burn. The carrier's rejig includes cancelling a lease for two more Boeing 737-800s, it has disclosed in a newly-released full-year financial statement. El Al has 12 787-9s – four owned and eight leased – plus three owned 787-8s, with a fourth and last due to have been delivered in March. The airline says it has not received the aircraft, and has extended to the end of June a loan for paying advances. El Al had signed a $122 million financing agreement for the twinjet in February. The funding is structured as a JOLCO, the airline says. The carrier had signed six-year leases for three 737-800s in November last year, one of which was delivered in February. But El Al says it has notified the lessor that it is cancelling the agreement for the two outstanding aircraft which were also due to enter service this year. Three other 737-800s in the El Al fleet have already become the subject of a sale and leaseback agreement tentatively reached in April. El Al had recently completed a renewal of 737-800 interiors, increasing the number of seats and installing features such as wi-fi and USB jacks. It also embarked on a programme in January to increase premium seating in its 787-9s, while reducing the number of economy seats on the type. As it negotiates an urgent $400 million loan with lenders and the Israeli government, El Al has prepared a draft business plan, covering several potential scenarios for the return of passenger operations as the crisis recedes. It includes a “streamlining” of labour costs as well as other expenditure, the airline says. But while the plan assumes a “gradual and limited operation” of the fleet, El Al stresses that it depends on various influences outside the company's control, notably the development of the epidemic and countries' decisions on lifting restrictions. There is no certainty that the critical loan will be signed, it adds, and an agreement is conditional on reaching a new collective pact with employees, completion of the sale and leaseback deal, and release of cash from a central compensation fund linked to the carrier's privatisation.",5,174,8.0,0.2666,"government, uk, carrier, business, state, share, south, airway, financial, plan","['israeli', 'flagcarrier', 'el', 'al', 'yet', 'take', 'delivery', 'final', 'shuffle', 'current', 'fleet', 'part', 'effort', 'reduce', 'cash', 'burn', 'carrier', 'rejig', 'include', 'cancel', 'lease', 'disclose', 'newlyreleased', 'fullyear', 'financial', 'statement', 'el', 'al', 'lease', 'plus', 'fourth', 'due', 'deliver', 'march', 'say', 'receive', 'extend', 'end', 'june', 'loan', 'pay', 'advance', 'el', 'al', 'sign', 'financing', 'agreement', 'twinjet', 'february', 'funding', 'structure', 'jolco', 'say', 'carrier', 'sign', 'sixyear', 'lease', 'november', 'deliver', 'february', 'el', 'al', 'say', 'notify', 'lessor', 'cancel', 'agreement', 'outstanding', 'due', 'enter', 'service', 'el', 'al', 'fleet', 'already', 'become', 'subject', 'sale', 'leaseback', 'agreement', 'tentatively', 'reach', 'april', 'el', 'al', 'recently', 'complete', 'renewal', 'interior', 'increase', 'number', 'seat', 'instal', 'feature', 'wifi', 'usb', 'jack', 'embark', 'programme', 'january', 'increase', 'premium', 'seat', 'reduce', 'number', 'economy', 'seat', 'type', 'negotiates', 'urgent', 'loan', 'lender', 'israeli', 'government', 'el', 'al', 'prepared', 'draft', 'business', 'plan', 'cover', 'several', 'potential', 'scenario', 'return', 'passenger', 'operation', 'crisis', 'recedes', 'include', 'streamline', 'labour', 'cost', 'well', 'expenditure', 'say', 'plan', 'assumes', 'gradual', 'limited', 'operation', 'fleet', 'el', 'al', 'stress', 'depends', 'various', 'influence', 'outside', 'control', 'notably', 'development', 'epidemic', 'country', 'decision', 'lift', 'restriction', 'certainty', 'critical', 'loan', 'sign', 'add', 'agreement', 'conditional', 'reach', 'collective', 'pact', 'employee', 'completion', 'sale', 'leaseback', 'deal', 'release', 'cash', 'central', 'compensation', 'fund', 'link', 'carrier', 'privatisation']"
"Israeli flag-carrier El Al has warned that the survival of the airline is uncertain as it seeks to secure urgent funding to cope with the coronavirus crisis. In its belated full-year financial statement, El Al says a loan is “essential” and that the are “significant doubts” about the continued existence of the company as a going concern. El Al's auditor has similarly drawn attention to the uncertainty over the airline's financial position. Deloitte states that the collapse of demand and disruption caused by the coronavirus outbreak has prompted El Al to adjust its cash outflow and negotiate with lenders over a loan of around $400 million. “Negotiations with the state and lender are continuing and uncertainty exists regarding completion,” it adds in a 'going concern' note. The airline points out that among the problems it is facing is a decline in aircraft values, which are normally used to secure loans for the company's activity. El Al is pushing back the release of its first-quarter results, aiming to publish them by 30 June. For the full year 2019 it turned in a net loss of $59.6 million, deeper than the previous year's $52.2 million. The airline's pre-tax loss was also higher, at $76.6 million. Revenues edged upwards by 2% to $2.18 billion while expenditure was down slightly to $1.83 billion.

"Brazilian carrier Azul is preparing a host of scenerios to manage the coronavirus crisis, while minimising cash burn and maintaining high liquidity levels. On the airline's quarterly analyst call on 14 May, chairman David Neeleman was optimistic and upbeat that Brazil's biggest airline will not suffer long-term ill-effects when global air travel rebounds, thanks to the flexible way the airline has responded to the crisis. “We're building the business back up. We have an unbelievably great franchise,” he says. “It sucks for all of us right now, but we are going to come back.” On 13 May, the airline announced it deferred 59 Embraer 195-E2 jet deliveries from the 2020-2023 period to “2024 and beyond” in order to preserve liquidity. The deferments occurred without penalty, Neeleman says. “It's in Embraer's long-term interest to have a strong Azul.” The Sao Paolo-based carrier was launch customer for Embraer's new variant, and has already taken delivery of five E195-E2s. Neeleman adds that the company is speaking to Airbus about orders with the Toulouse-based manufacturer. “We are close to an agreement with Airbus,” he says. Azul will “not take any aircraft that we don't need”. According to Cirium fleets data, Azul has orders for 28 A320neos, 10 A321neos and one A330-900. Azul generated revenue of R2.8 billion ($470 million) in the first quarter, up 10.3% from the same period a year ago. It has R6.7 billion of liquidity to fall back on in the coming months and expects daily cash burn to fall to R3-4 billion by May, chief executive John Rodgerson says. About 78% of the company's workers, or about 10,500 employees, have taken voluntary unpaid leave, executives add, leading to an expected 50% salary reduction for the second quarter. Operating costs are expected to be down 55% from the same quarter in 2019. The airline has been flexible in rightsizing its network as demand fluctuated in past weeks. Currently, it operates a maximum of 118 flights daily to 38 destinations, well off the pre-crisis numbers of 950 flights to 116 cities, but higher than the slowest date in April, when it operated just 70 flights to 25 cities. At the end of March, before it became obvious how drastically air service across the vast South American country would be affected by the pandemic, the Brazilian government developed an essential air services plan for the country. Azul and competitors Gol and LATAM guaranteed all 27 state capitals and 19 other large cities would remain accessible by air during the crisis. They committed to operating 1,241 instead of the scheduled 14,871 weekly flights, representing capacity reduction of nearly 92%, while the number of airports served by the three carriers fell more than half, from 106 to 46. “We are well off the bottoms, which came in the second week of April, and we have seen a bounce back from that which is very good,” chief revenue officer Abhi Manoj Shah says. He adds that fleet flexibility has helped minimise cash burn. “Today we are flying Caravans in markets we used to fly ATRs, ATRs where we used to fly Embraers, and Embraers where we were using A320s,” he adds. That said, demand on some routes has increased such that Azul has transitioned some Cessna Caravan routes back to A321s. “We are launching new routes every week, and removing stuff that doesn't work.” The Caravans belong to TwoFlex, also known as Two Taxi AÃ©reo, a regional carrier which Azul acquired in January. Azul paid R123 million for the airline, and the transaction closed on 14 May. Before the crisis, TwoFlex operated 17 Caravans and provided regular passenger and cargo service to 39 Brazilian destinations. Azul expects capacity will be down 75-85% year-on-year for the current quarter, ending in June. At the moment, the airline hopes by December to be flying about 40% of its pre-crisis capacity – 400 of a previous 1,000 daily flights. Revenue from Azul's cargo business rose almost 39% during the first quarter, Rodgerson says, adding that the airline sees cargo potential. Azul has transitioned two A320s from passenger- to cargo-only operations, chief revenue officer Shah adds. “Nine aircraft are now dedicated to the cargo team, so they are making hay while the sun shines.”",5,177,0.0,0.2228,"order, business, jet, delivery, production, customer, deliver, commercial, quarter, include","['brazilian', 'carrier', 'azul', 'prepare', 'host', 'scenerios', 'manage', 'coronavirus', 'crisis', 'minimise', 'cash', 'burn', 'maintain', 'high', 'liquidity', 'level', 'quarterly', 'analyst', 'call', 'may', 'chairman', 'david', 'neeleman', 'optimistic', 'upbeat', 'brazil', 'big', 'suffer', 'longterm', 'illeffects', 'global', 'travel', 'rebound', 'thanks', 'flexible', 'way', 'respond', 'crisis', 'building', 'business', 'back', 'unbelievably', 'great', 'franchise', 'say', 'suck', 'u', 'right', 'go', 'come', 'may', 'announce', 'defer', 'embraer', 'jet', 'delivery', 'period', 'beyond', 'order', 'preserve', 'liquidity', 'deferment', 'occur', 'without', 'penalty', 'neeleman', 'say', 'embraer', 'longterm', 'interest', 'strong', 'sao', 'paolobased', 'carrier', 'launch', 'customer', 'embraer', 'variant', 'already', 'take', 'delivery', 'neeleman', 'add', 'speak', 'order', 'toulousebased', 'manufacturer', 'close', 'agreement', 'say', 'azul', 'take', 'need', 'accord', 'fleet', 'data', 'azul', 'order', 'azul', 'generate', 'revenue', 'quarter', 'period', 'ago', 'liquidity', 'fall', 'back', 'come', 'month', 'expect', 'daily', 'cash', 'burn', 'fall', 'may', 'chief', 'executive', 'john', 'rodgerson', 'say', 'worker', 'employee', 'take', 'voluntary', 'unpaid', 'leave', 'executive', 'add', 'lead', 'expect', 'salary', 'reduction', 'second', 'quarter', 'operating', 'cost', 'expect', 'quarter', 'flexible', 'rightsizing', 'network', 'demand', 'fluctuate', 'past', 'week', 'currently', 'operates', 'maximum', 'daily', 'destination', 'well', 'precrisis', 'number', 'city', 'high', 'slowest', 'date', 'april', 'operate', 'city', 'end', 'march', 'become', 'obvious', 'drastically', 'service', 'across', 'vast', 'south', 'american', 'country', 'affected', 'pandemic', 'brazilian', 'government', 'developed', 'essential', 'service', 'plan', 'country', 'azul', 'competitor', 'gol', 'latam', 'guaranteed', 'state', 'capital', 'large', 'city', 'remain', 'accessible', 'crisis', 'commit', 'operating', 'instead', 'schedule', 'weekly', 'represent', 'capacity', 'reduction', 'nearly', 'number', 'airport', 'serve', 'carrier', 'fell', 'half', 'well', 'bottom', 'come', 'second', 'week', 'april', 'see', 'bounce', 'back', 'good', 'chief', 'revenue', 'officer', 'abhi', 'manoj', 'shah', 'say', 'add', 'fleet', 'flexibility', 'help', 'minimise', 'cash', 'burn', 'today', 'fly', 'caravan', 'market', 'use', 'fly', 'atrs', 'atrs', 'use', 'fly', 'embraers', 'embraers', 'use', 'add', 'say', 'demand', 'route', 'increase', 'azul', 'transition', 'cessna', 'caravan', 'route', 'back', 'launch', 'route', 'every', 'week', 'remove', 'stuff', 'caravan', 'belong', 'twoflex', 'know', 'taxi', 'regional', 'carrier', 'azul', 'acquire', 'january', 'azul', 'paid', 'transaction', 'close', 'may', 'crisis', 'twoflex', 'operate', 'caravan', 'provide', 'regular', 'passenger', 'cargo', 'service', 'brazilian', 'destination', 'azul', 'expect', 'capacity', 'yearonyear', 'current', 'quarter', 'end', 'june', 'moment', 'hope', 'december', 'fly', 'precrisis', 'capacity', 'previous', 'daily', 'revenue', 'azul', 'cargo', 'business', 'rise', 'almost', 'quarter', 'rodgerson', 'say', 'add', 'see', 'cargo', 'potential', 'azul', 'transition', 'passenger', 'cargoonly', 'operation', 'chief', 'revenue', 'officer', 'shah', 'add', 'dedicate', 'cargo', 'team', 'make', 'hay', 'sun', 'shine']"
"SIA Group saw its annual operating profit dwindle to S$59 million ($41 million) in the 12 months ended 31 March – from S$1.07 billion the previous financial year – and was loss-making at the net level. The group says results were strong for the first nine months of fiscal 2019/20 but, amid the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, fourth-quarter revenue fell 22%. An operating loss of S$803 million in the fourth quarter compares with a profit of $253 million a year ago. The annual net loss of S$212 million, meanwhile, compares with a profit of $683 million the previous year. Full-year revenue declined 2.1% to $16 billion as expenses rose 4.3% to S$15.9 billion. While the group's mainline carrier Singapore Airlines made an operating profit – albeit one much lower, at S$294 million compared with S$991 million the previous year –Scootand SilkAir both incurred losses. Scoot's operating loss of S$198 million deepened one of S$15 million the previous year, while SilkAir slipped to a S$112 million loss from a S$15 million profit. SIA Engineering, however, improved its operating result, turning in a profit up S$11 million at S$68 million. The group says it expects to raise S$8.8 billion with a rights issue which will be completed by June, and also has the option of issuing an extra S$6.2 billion through convertible bonds, should the Covid-19 crisis persist. SIA says it is “exploring other sources of funding, including financing and sale-and-leaseback transactions” to help shore up liquidity. The group has “no visibility” on the timing of the airline industry's recovery, but says there are “few signs of an abatement” in the pandemic. “Minimum flight connectivity” will be maintained for the foreseeable future, though SIA has the flexibility “to scale up capacity if there is an uptick in demand”.

"UK investigators have determined that a Pakistan International Airlines Boeing 777-200LR incorrectly assumed that ground-support equipment had been removed before commencing to taxi, striking the towbar which was still in front of the jet. The tug and towbar had been disconnected from the aircraft (AP-BGZ), which was preparing to depart Birmingham on 22 August last year. UK Air Accidents Investigation Branch analysis found that the 777 crew could see the tug parked to the left of the aircraft's nose, and assumed the ground personnel had left. But the ground personnel – unseen by the pilots – were positioning the towbar behind the tug, ready for removal. The captain asked the first officer to request taxi clearance. Neither checked with air traffic control to remove doubt that all ground personnel were clear, and neither received a final all-clear hand signal. Just 23s after the towbar was disconnected, the 777 began to move forwards. The inquiry says this interval would normally be around 2-3min. “Shortly after starting to move, the aircraft struck the towbar and the crew stopped and applied the parking brake,” says the inquiry. Neither of the ground personnel nor the tug was struck by the aircraft, although the towbar and the runway surface were damaged. The aircraft was inspected by a ground engineer and subsequently cleared to depart.",5,179,7.0,0.4381,"crew, runway, inquiry, land, approach, accident, investigator, captain, incident, pilot","['uk', 'investigator', 'determine', 'pakistan', 'international', 'incorrectly', 'assume', 'groundsupport', 'equipment', 'remove', 'commence', 'taxi', 'strike', 'towbar', 'still', 'front', 'jet', 'tug', 'towbar', 'disconnect', 'apbgz', 'prepare', 'depart', 'birmingham', 'august', 'uk', 'accident', 'investigation', 'branch', 'analysis', 'found', 'crew', 'see', 'tug', 'park', 'left', 'nose', 'assume', 'ground', 'personnel', 'left', 'ground', 'personnel', 'unseen', 'pilot', 'position', 'towbar', 'behind', 'tug', 'ready', 'removal', 'captain', 'ask', 'officer', 'request', 'taxi', 'clearance', 'neither', 'checked', 'traffic', 'control', 'remove', 'doubt', 'ground', 'personnel', 'clear', 'neither', 'receive', 'final', 'allclear', 'hand', 'signal', 'towbar', 'disconnect', 'begin', 'move', 'forward', 'inquiry', 'say', 'interval', 'normally', 'around', 'shortly', 'start', 'move', 'struck', 'towbar', 'crew', 'stop', 'apply', 'parking', 'brake', 'say', 'inquiry', 'neither', 'ground', 'personnel', 'tug', 'struck', 'although', 'towbar', 'runway', 'surface', 'damage', 'inspect', 'ground', 'engineer', 'subsequently', 'clear', 'depart']"
"British Airways has highlighted to crews the importance of avoiding distraction while conducting take-off calculations, after a low-thrust incident involving an Airbus A321's departure from Glasgow. The aircraft, bound for London Heathrow on 24 November last year, was being prepared for a full-length take-off from runway 05. As part of the performance calculation the crew opted for low-thrust take-off, typically used to reduce noise and engine wear, by using a flex temperature of 49°C. Entering a flex temperature that is higher than the actual outside temperature results in the engine control system adapting thrust to a lower – but still sufficient – setting for the supposedly hotter conditions. But the UK Air Accidents Investigation Branch says the crew inadvertently entered a flex temperature of 79°C – unwittingly reducing the thrust level to be commanded during take-off. The captain testified to the inquiry that he was unsure if he had said the wrong number when reading the flex temperature data or whether the first officer mistakenly pushed the wrong key. Investigators state that, either way, the error was not detected – possibly because the crew was distracted by a cabin-crew call or the unusual acceleration altitude which was part of the departure calculation. “The subsequent checks do not require the flight crew to refer back to the source data,” says the inquiry, adding that the selected flex temperature, while unusual for an A321, was not so for A319s which the crew had also flown. Although air traffic control asked the crew, during taxi, whether they could depart from an intersection, the A321 (G-EUXJ) eventually began the take-off roll on the full-length runway. As it accelerated the crew realised the twinjet was delivering insufficient thrust, and go-around power was selected at 137kt.

"Russia's government is allocating Rb23.4 billion ($317 million) to the country's carriers to provide financial support as the coronavirus crisis begins to affect their operations substantially. Passenger traffic among Russian airlines was down by 93% in April. Aeroflot, Rossiya and Ural Airlines passengers numbers fell by 92-95%, while Utair's and S7 Group's figures respectively slumped by 89% and 79%, according to preliminary data from federal air transport regulator Rosaviatsia. The impact of the crisis has started to show in financial results. Aeroflot's first-quarter figures, published under local accounting standards, reveal a net loss of Rb16.1 billion – around the same level as the previous year, but the airline points out that last year's loss was already “unusually high” as a result of fuel costs. Rosaviatsia says the state support will “ensure the continuation of Russian airlines' activities”, and is intended to repay costs of carriers engaged in commercial transport over February-July 2020. The subsidy will enable airlines to pay the salaries of aviation personnel, and partially contribute towards leasing payments and airport parking fees. Russian airlines receiving the support must continue passenger transport operations and maintain an employee count at least 90% of the level on 1 January. “Part of the subsidy may be aimed at paying expenses for operating activities and property maintenance,” adds Rosaviatsia. In a decree dated 13 May outlining the subsidies measure the government states that Rosaviatsia should monitor the “effective use” of the support, and report back by 1 February 2021.",5,181,3.0,0.1761,"passenger, loss, operating, revenue, traffic, month, increase, capacity, decline, result","['russia', 'government', 'allocate', 'country', 'carrier', 'provide', 'financial', 'support', 'coronavirus', 'crisis', 'begin', 'affect', 'operation', 'substantially', 'passenger', 'traffic', 'among', 'russian', 'april', 'aeroflot', 'rossiya', 'ural', 'passenger', 'number', 'fell', 'utair', 'figure', 'respectively', 'slump', 'accord', 'preliminary', 'data', 'federal', 'transport', 'regulator', 'rosaviatsia', 'impact', 'crisis', 'start', 'financial', 'result', 'aeroflot', 'firstquarter', 'figure', 'publish', 'local', 'accounting', 'standard', 'reveal', 'net', 'loss', 'around', 'level', 'previous', 'point', 'loss', 'already', 'unusually', 'high', 'result', 'fuel', 'cost', 'rosaviatsia', 'say', 'state', 'support', 'ensure', 'continuation', 'russian', 'activity', 'intend', 'repay', 'cost', 'carrier', 'engage', 'commercial', 'transport', 'februaryjuly', 'subsidy', 'enable', 'pay', 'salary', 'personnel', 'partially', 'contribute', 'towards', 'lease', 'payment', 'airport', 'parking', 'fee', 'russian', 'receive', 'support', 'must', 'continue', 'passenger', 'transport', 'operation', 'maintain', 'employee', 'count', 'least', 'level', 'january', 'part', 'subsidy', 'may', 'aim', 'pay', 'expense', 'operating', 'activity', 'property', 'maintenance', 'add', 'rosaviatsia', 'decree', 'date', 'may', 'outline', 'subsidy', 'measure', 'government', 'state', 'rosaviatsia', 'monitor', 'effective', 'use', 'support', 'report', 'back', 'february']"
"Jet Airways, the Indian carrier that suspended operations last year amid financial difficulties, has launched a fourth search for a buyer. A document on the Mumbai-based carrier's website, a version of which was also published in various Indian newspapers, sets a deadline of 28 May 2020 for expressions of interest. Jet Airways will then publish a final list of prospective resolution applicants on 10 June 2020. It estimates that these will then be submitted to an “adjudicating authority” around 23 July 2020.

"Bangkok Airways posted an operating loss of over Bt260 million ($8.1 million) in the first quarter of 2020, undoing the Bt870 million operating profit in the same period last year. Revenue for the quarter ended 31 March fell 17.5% year-on-year to Bt6.42 billion. Passenger revenue declined 25.3% to Bt4.45 billion, and the carrier attributed this to a fall in passenger numbers amid the coronavirus pandemic. The airline reported a net loss of nearly Bt339 million, compared to the Bt504 million net profit last year. Overall passenger numbers in January to March fell 23.2% to 1.32 million and passenger load factor declined 12.5 percentage points to 62.1%. However, passenger yield gained 1.1% to Bt4.77. Revenue passenger-kilometres were down 26.9% and available seat-kilometre down by 12.1%. Unit costs including fuel was 4% lower, and excluding fuel, this was up by 12.5% to Bt3.14. As of 31 March 2020, the company had Bt4.55 billion in cash and cash equivalents, a slight decline from Bt4.79 billion at 31 March 2019. The carrier was granted approval by the Civil Aviation Authority of Thailand to suspend eight domestic routes and 20 international routes, starting March. In March, Gulf Air and Bangkok Airways signed a codeshare agreement for Gulf Air to place its code on seven domestic routes operated by Bangkok Airways.

"The US Department of Transportation (DOT) will allow airlines to suspend service to at least five additional locations on their networks in an ongoing process to minimize the costs of operating flights amid coronavirus while keeping the USA connected. The CARES Act gives authority to the US Transportation and Treasury departments to determine conditions for airlines to follow in exchange for federal assistance. In response to petitions from carriers, labour groups and trade associations, the DOT on 12 May published a notice explaining a strategy to reduce service commitments beyond exemptions already granted to different carriers. “Carriers contend that services to certain points in their networks are unreasonable, impracticable, costly, and challenging to complete in light of public health and safety concerns,” the DOT states. Airlines will be allowed to exempt 5% of the locations in their service obligation list, or five locations, whichever is greater, and will have until 18 May to submit such requests to DOT. Essential Air Service obligations, including service to certain remote areas, will not be affected. “If a carrier seeks to exempt points where the carrier is the only covered carrier at that point, the department will not provide an exemption,” DOT says. A list provided by the DOT estimates the potential number of locations each recipient of CARES Act assistance may be eligible to exempt. United Airlines, American Airlines and Delta Air Lines could each be eligible to exempt 11 airports.

"Qatar Airways is set to retire around 50 aircraft and almost a fifth of its staff in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. The airline may also provide cash support to airlines in which it has investments should such a move be required to secure equity. “Unfortunately, we will have to cut nearly 20% of our workforce – nearly equal to the amount of aeroplanes we will never fly again, over the next three years,” Qatar Airways group chief executive Akbar Al Baker told the BBC in an interview. “It's a very hard decision...but we have no alternative.” The airline currently has a fleet of 245 aircraft, according to Cirium data, around half of which are in temporary storage due to capacity cuts. Qatar Airways Group holds equity stakes in a number of airline groups globally including Cathay Pacific, IAG and LATAM. Al Baker denies reports of a plan to provide a financial bail-out for Cathay, but does not rule out cash injections to support any of the group's investments. “If there is a recall for an injection in equity [at Cathay], as a shareholder we will do it otherwise we will lose our equity share. The same goes with all our other investments,” he says. “We have invested strategically for the long-term. We have a pie and we will have to share it equally between our staff and the investments that we have.” Al Baker joins other airlines with a stark warning about the consequences of states introducing lengthy quarantine periods for air travellers: “[Quarantining] will really destroy the industry, destroy airport feasibility and their income.

"IATA has warned the coronavirus crisis will result in semi-permanent damage to the airline industry and may subdue passenger revenues until 2024. During its latest weekly update on the coronavirus crisis, IATA on 13 May forecast that revenue passenger-kilometres (RPKs) would decline to under 4 billion per year in 2020 from around 8 billion before the virus struck. Under the association's baseline scenario, traffic will then stage a recovery to 2019 levels in 2023. This would put the key metric of airline revenues at 32% below IATA's previous expectations for 2021. The underlying assumption is that there will be a reopening of domestic travel markets in the third quarter, followed by a phased restoration of international markets. “We think that Covid's effects on air travel are certainly going to last for a number of years, with no quick rebounds to 2019 levels, unlike the current forecast for GDP,” says IATA chief economist Brian Pearce. However, under IATA's “setback scenario” – in which lockdowns are extended into the third quarter, possibly due to a second wave of infections – global traffic would be 34% below 2019 levels in 2021 and 41% below its pre-Covid-19 predictions. Under this scenario, 2019 levels of demand would not be regained until 2024. Regardless of which scenario plays out, IATA expects the industry to face a far slower recovery than the wider economy. “If international borders are to reopen to international travel...this is last on the list for government measures,” notes Pearce. But so far, there is little appetite for this to happen: “We have yet to see a stabilisation for Covid-19, particularly for emerging markets.” One indicator for how travel may return can be found in the Chinese market. Data from IATA shows that as the Chinese economy has reopened, business confidence in the country has bounced back, albeit to a level still lower than before the coronavirus crisis began. Yet there has been a much slower recovery in airline passenger traffic. “It is clearly the case that air travel will lag the recovery in domestic economies, because consumers in particular will need the confidence...to start engaging in discretionary spending,” says Pearce. Another development stunting any recovery in passenger revenues is an expected fall in average trip lengths, of around 8-9%. This reflects the expectation that domestic air travel is likely to resume first, but also that consumers may be wary about venturing further from home, says Pearce. “The consequence of this is that RPKs...are likely to be growing more slowly than the rise in passenger numbers.”",5,186,9.0,0.3843,"industry, crisis, demand, coronavirus, global, iata, market, level, cargo, expect","['iata', 'warn', 'coronavirus', 'crisis', 'result', 'semipermanent', 'damage', 'industry', 'may', 'subdue', 'passenger', 'revenue', 'late', 'weekly', 'update', 'coronavirus', 'crisis', 'iata', 'may', 'forecast', 'revenue', 'passengerkilometres', 'rpks', 'decline', 'per', 'around', 'virus', 'struck', 'association', 'baseline', 'scenario', 'traffic', 'stage', 'recovery', 'level', 'put', 'key', 'metric', 'revenue', 'iata', 'previous', 'expectation', 'underlie', 'assumption', 'reopen', 'domestic', 'travel', 'market', 'third', 'quarter', 'follow', 'phase', 'restoration', 'international', 'market', 'think', 'covid', 'effect', 'travel', 'certainly', 'go', 'number', 'quick', 'rebound', 'level', 'unlike', 'current', 'forecast', 'gdp', 'say', 'iata', 'chief', 'economist', 'brian', 'pearce', 'however', 'iata', 'setback', 'scenario', 'lockdown', 'extend', 'third', 'quarter', 'possibly', 'due', 'second', 'wave', 'infection', 'global', 'traffic', 'level', 'precoronavirus', 'prediction', 'scenario', 'level', 'demand', 'regain', 'regardless', 'scenario', 'play', 'iata', 'expect', 'industry', 'face', 'far', 'slow', 'recovery', 'wider', 'economy', 'international', 'border', 'reopen', 'international', 'travel', 'list', 'government', 'measure', 'note', 'pearce', 'far', 'little', 'appetite', 'happen', 'yet', 'see', 'stabilisation', 'coronavirus', 'particularly', 'emerge', 'indicator', 'travel', 'may', 'return', 'found', 'chinese', 'market', 'data', 'iata', 'chinese', 'economy', 'reopen', 'business', 'confidence', 'country', 'bounce', 'back', 'albeit', 'level', 'still', 'low', 'coronavirus', 'crisis', 'begin', 'yet', 'much', 'slow', 'recovery', 'passenger', 'traffic', 'clearly', 'case', 'travel', 'lag', 'recovery', 'domestic', 'economy', 'consumer', 'particular', 'need', 'confidence', 'start', 'engage', 'discretionary', 'spending', 'say', 'pearce', 'another', 'development', 'stunt', 'recovery', 'passenger', 'revenue', 'expect', 'fall', 'average', 'trip', 'length', 'around', 'reflect', 'expectation', 'domestic', 'travel', 'likely', 'resume', 'consumer', 'may', 'wary', 'venture', 'far', 'home', 'say', 'pearce', 'consequence', 'rpks', 'likely', 'grow', 'slowly', 'rise', 'passenger', 'number']"
"Washington think tank Rand has outlined the challenges facing US Air Force (USAF) and defence planners in a series of papers focusing on the future of warfare in the coming decade. The series of papers, which were sponsored by USAF, points out that the US has a poor record predicting when and where conflicts occur, but it examines key trends behind the full spectrum of potential conflicts. Trends that will have implications for the USAF include China's rise and militarisation, the reactions of Asia-Pacific governments to this rise, Russia's re-emergence as a strategic rival, the potential for upheaval in Europe, and turmoil in the Islamic world. Potential conflicts could range from “grey zone” operations in the cyber realm, to continued conflict in the Middle East, and to a high-end war with China or Russia. “On a strategic level, the joint force will need to be able to adapt to changing environments more quickly and to shift assets more readily across theaters and problem sets in response to adversaries' actions,” says Rand. “Operationally and tactically, the joint force will need to be able to shift focus across the range of conflict and adapt to new technologies, including those that can credibly threaten areas where the United States has enjoyed virtual supremacy, such as the air and space domains.” It also warns that the USA's qualitative and quantitative edge is diminishing against rivals, particularly China. To deal with this, USAF requires continued investments in precision, information, and automation, in addition to a forward presence and improved agility. Moreover, a high-end conflict with China, which would focus on the maritime realm, would differ from a land-based conflict with Russia. Still, there would be similarities. Rand warns that Beijing is closing the qualitative gap with the USAF. “Although neither China nor Russia fully replicates the capabilities of the US military, both will likely have homefield advantage, localised numerical superiority, and a nearing qualitative edge – complete with sophisticated weapon systems, such as advanced air defense systems, extensive offensive and defensive space and cyber capabilities, and the ability to wage a tactical nuclear war.” In addition, second-tier rivals such as Iran and North Korea are investing in anti-access/area denial capabilities, which will force the USAF to operate from greater ranges. Another complication is climate change, with rising seas and rising temperatures potentially reducing USAF basing options. Rand foresees artificial intelligence having a significant effect. “Although no one can be certain just how AI will shape the conduct of warfare, it is certain that it will have a profound effect – from speeding up the pace of the targeting cycles to changing the very nature of when and how wars are fought in the first place.”",5,187,1.0,0.4084,"test, force, helicopter, fire, system, service, attack, design, usaf, missile","['washington', 'think', 'tank', 'rand', 'outline', 'challenge', 'face', 'u', 'force', 'usaf', 'defence', 'planner', 'series', 'paper', 'focus', 'future', 'warfare', 'come', 'decade', 'series', 'paper', 'sponsor', 'usaf', 'point', 'u', 'poor', 'record', 'predict', 'conflict', 'occur', 'examines', 'key', 'trend', 'behind', 'full', 'spectrum', 'potential', 'conflict', 'trend', 'implication', 'usaf', 'include', 'rise', 'militarisation', 'reaction', 'asiapacific', 'government', 'rise', 'russia', 'reemergence', 'strategic', 'rival', 'potential', 'upheaval', 'europe', 'turmoil', 'islamic', 'world', 'potential', 'conflict', 'range', 'grey', 'zone', 'operation', 'cyber', 'realm', 'continued', 'conflict', 'middle', 'east', 'highend', 'war', 'russia', 'strategic', 'level', 'joint', 'force', 'need', 'able', 'adapt', 'change', 'environment', 'quickly', 'shift', 'asset', 'readily', 'across', 'theater', 'problem', 'set', 'response', 'adversary', 'action', 'say', 'rand', 'operationally', 'tactically', 'joint', 'force', 'need', 'able', 'shift', 'focus', 'across', 'range', 'conflict', 'adapt', 'technology', 'include', 'credibly', 'threaten', 'area', 'united', 'state', 'enjoy', 'virtual', 'supremacy', 'space', 'warns', 'usa', 'qualitative', 'quantitative', 'edge', 'diminish', 'rival', 'particularly', 'deal', 'usaf', 'require', 'continued', 'investment', 'precision', 'information', 'automation', 'addition', 'forward', 'presence', 'improve', 'agility', 'moreover', 'highend', 'conflict', 'focus', 'maritime', 'realm', 'differ', 'landbased', 'conflict', 'russia', 'still', 'similarity', 'rand', 'warns', 'beijing', 'closing', 'qualitative', 'gap', 'usaf', 'although', 'neither', 'russia', 'fully', 'replicates', 'capability', 'u', 'military', 'likely', 'homefield', 'advantage', 'localise', 'numerical', 'superiority', 'near', 'qualitative', 'edge', 'complete', 'sophisticated', 'weapon', 'system', 'advanced', 'defense', 'system', 'extensive', 'offensive', 'defensive', 'space', 'cyber', 'capability', 'ability', 'wage', 'tactical', 'nuclear', 'addition', 'secondtier', 'rival', 'iran', 'north', 'korea', 'invest', 'denial', 'capability', 'force', 'usaf', 'operate', 'great', 'range', 'another', 'complication', 'climate', 'change', 'rise', 'sea', 'rise', 'temperature', 'potentially', 'reduce', 'usaf', 'base', 'option', 'rand', 'foresees', 'artificial', 'intelligence', 'significant', 'effect', 'although', 'certain', 'ai', 'shape', 'conduct', 'warfare', 'certain', 'profound', 'effect', 'speed', 'pace', 'target', 'cycle', 'change', 'nature', 'war', 'fought', 'place']"

Operating expenses also inched higher year-over-year to $53 million, rising from $49 million, driven mainly by maintenance costs. “The losses for most regionals are staggering, but since regionals are paid by the mainline not the passenger it looks different, as the losses are generally the reduction in flying from the major partner rather than the reduction in passengers buying tickets,” Regional Airline Association president Faye Malarkey Black tells Cirium. Mesa's capacity purchase agreements with American and United award fixed payments for operating flights even if there are few people on each trip. Most regional carriers at the start of 2020 had been increasing staff to help mainlines meet the growth in travel demand that had been projected before the global spread of coronavirus, says Black. That demand has evaporated amid the health crisis. At 31 March, the Phoenix-based regional carrier had $52 million in unrestricted cash and equivalents. During the quarter it drew down $23 million from its credit facility and paid $43 million in scheduled principal payments on aircraft and engine debt. Mesa will receive $92.5 million grants from the federal CARES Act assistance through 30 September to support the pay and benefits for its workers. It will not have to provide collateral to the US Treasury Department because it is receiving less than $100 million. The carrier has also applied for a loan through a separate pool of CARES Act funding but is awaiting more details from Treasury. If it becomes necessary to downsize in October after CARES payroll support expires, the carrier will reduce administrative staff by less than 100 people and cut crew, including pilots and flight attendants, proportional to how operations are scaled, chief operating officer Brad Rich says. REARRANGING FLEET Mesa and mainlines are making changes within their contract parameters to save costs, including providing reduced rates through the end of September and deferring aircraft deliveries. Before the coronavirus travel downturn in the USA began in March, Mesa was operating 630 flights per day, which dropped to 194 flights per day in April, before ticking up slightly to 240 flights per day in May. United will postpone taking 20 Embraer E175s “until late 2020 and early 2021”, which were initially scheduled to deliver in May, Ornstein said during the call. Mesa will keep 20 Bombardier CRJ-700s through its capacity purchase agreement until the E175s are delivered. After the Embraer jets arrive, the CRJs will be leased to another United Express carrier. The regional carrier is working to extend its capacity purchase agreement with American, and has, so far, been assured it “will continue to be part of the American portfolio of carriers”, Rich says. Three aircraft that were previously deferred will be removed from the American agreement. Assuming the contract is not extended, 49 of the 56 aircraft in the agreement would expire between January 2021 and April 2022, he adds. Mesa plans to enter the cargo business before the end of the 2020, which has returned to profitability despite the coronavirus downturn. It will start by operating up to three aircraft that will be provided to them by a cargo operator and plans to eventually expand cargo operations, Ornstein says.",5,189,3.0,0.1679,"passenger, loss, operating, revenue, traffic, month, increase, capacity, decline, result","['mesa', 'generate', 'operating', 'profit', 'fiscal', 'second', 'quarter', 'drop', 'yearoveryear', 'even', 'coronavirus', 'crisis', 'cause', 'significant', 'drop', 'travel', 'demand', 'usa', 'parent', 'mesa', 'operates', 'capacity', 'purchase', 'agreement', 'american', 'united', 'take', 'step', 'reduce', 'cost', 'include', 'defer', 'heavy', 'maintenance', 'believe', 'cash', 'flow', 'break', 'even', 'today', 'mesa', 'chief', 'executive', 'jonathan', 'ornstein', 'say', 'earnings', 'call', 'may', 'believe', 'suffer', 'negative', 'cash', 'operating', 'revenue', 'rise', 'slightly', 'quarter', 'operating', 'expense', 'inched', 'high', 'yearoveryear', 'rise', 'driven', 'mainly', 'maintenance', 'cost', 'loss', 'regionals', 'stagger', 'since', 'regionals', 'paid', 'mainline', 'passenger', 'look', 'different', 'loss', 'generally', 'reduction', 'fly', 'major', 'partner', 'rather', 'reduction', 'passenger', 'buying', 'ticket', 'regional', 'association', 'president', 'faye', 'malarkey', 'black', 'tell', 'mesa', 'capacity', 'purchase', 'agreement', 'american', 'united', 'award', 'fix', 'payment', 'operating', 'even', 'people', 'trip', 'regional', 'carrier', 'start', 'increase', 'staff', 'help', 'mainlines', 'meet', 'growth', 'travel', 'demand', 'project', 'global', 'spread', 'coronavirus', 'say', 'black', 'demand', 'evaporate', 'amid', 'health', 'crisis', 'march', 'phoenixbased', 'regional', 'carrier', 'unrestricted', 'cash', 'equivalent', 'quarter', 'drew', 'credit', 'facility', 'paid', 'schedule', 'principal', 'payment', 'engine', 'debt', 'mesa', 'receive', 'grant', 'federal', 'care', 'act', 'assistance', 'september', 'support', 'pay', 'benefit', 'worker', 'provide', 'collateral', 'u', 'treasury', 'department', 'receive', 'less', 'carrier', 'apply', 'loan', 'separate', 'pool', 'care', 'act', 'funding', 'await', 'detail', 'treasury', 'becomes', 'necessary', 'downsize', 'october', 'care', 'payroll', 'support', 'expires', 'carrier', 'reduce', 'administrative', 'staff', 'less', 'people', 'cut', 'crew', 'include', 'pilot', 'attendant', 'proportional', 'operation', 'scale', 'chief', 'operating', 'officer', 'brad', 'rich', 'say', 'rearrange', 'fleet', 'mesa', 'mainlines', 'make', 'change', 'within', 'contract', 'parameter', 'save', 'cost', 'include', 'provide', 'reduce', 'rate', 'end', 'september', 'defer', 'delivery', 'coronavirus', 'travel', 'downturn', 'usa', 'begin', 'march', 'mesa', 'operating', 'per', 'day', 'drop', 'per', 'day', 'april', 'tick', 'slightly', 'per', 'day', 'may', 'united', 'postpone', 'take', 'embraer', 'late', 'early', 'initially', 'schedule', 'deliver', 'may', 'ornstein', 'say', 'call', 'mesa', 'keep', 'bombardier', 'capacity', 'purchase', 'agreement', 'deliver', 'embraer', 'jet', 'arrive', 'crjs', 'lease', 'another', 'united', 'express', 'carrier', 'regional', 'carrier', 'work', 'extend', 'capacity', 'purchase', 'agreement', 'american', 'far', 'assure', 'continue', 'part', 'american', 'portfolio', 'carrier', 'rich', 'say', 'previously', 'defer', 'remove', 'american', 'agreement', 'assume', 'contract', 'extend', 'agreement', 'expire', 'january', 'april', 'add', 'mesa', 'plan', 'enter', 'cargo', 'business', 'end', 'return', 'profitability', 'despite', 'coronavirus', 'downturn', 'start', 'operating', 'provide', 'cargo', 'operator', 'plan', 'eventually', 'expand', 'cargo', 'operation', 'ornstein', 'say']"
"Boeing delivered six aircraft in April, bringing its deliveries in the first four months of the year to 56, a 67% slide from the January-April period last year. The April delivery figures reflect the 737 Max grounding and the much broader impact of a downturn that slammed the entire civil aerospace sector, hammering airlines, airframers, suppliers, service providers and most other companies in the chain. Chicago-based Boeing's backlog declined in April as customers cancelled orders for 108 737 Max.  Canadian discounter WestJet operates a fleet of 787s, deploying them primarily on transatlantic routes. Those include 98 already disclosed Max terminations (69 by lessor GE Capital Aviation Services and 29 by Chinese lessor CDB Aviation), plus 10 Max canceled by unnamed customers, according to Boeing. Boeing trimmed its backlog by another 101 jets, including 99 737 Max and two 787s, to comply with accounting standards. The company still holds sales contracts for those aircraft but has less confidence the sales will close. Boeing's backlog stood at 4,834 aircraft at the end of April, down from 5,049 one month earlier. The manufacturer stresses that the slumping delivery figures highlight market realities and its own efforts to help airline customers adjust. Airlines globally have scrambled to ground thousands of jets as the coronavirus obliterated air travel demand. Showing a similar trend, Airbus delivered 14 aircraft in April, down 80% year-on-year. Boeing likewise attributes April's Max cancellations to market conditions and efforts to assist customers. But, it notes those terminations and others this year will ease backlog pressure, helping it more quickly get deliveries on track once the grounding lifts. Boeing's six April deliveries included one 737NG-based maritime surveillance aircraft, one 777 and four 787s. By comparison, the airframer delivered 23 aircraft in April 2019 – a month also skewed by the 737 Max grounding, which occurred in March 2019. The 56 jet deliveries in the first four months of 2020 compared to 172 deliveries in the same period last year. Boeing has received orders for 49 jets this year, but cancellations and conversions bring its year-to-date net orders to negative 255, it says.",5,190,0.0,0.385,"order, business, jet, delivery, production, customer, deliver, commercial, quarter, include","['deliver', 'april', 'bring', 'delivery', 'month', 'slide', 'januaryapril', 'period', 'april', 'delivery', 'figure', 'reflect', 'ground', 'much', 'broader', 'impact', 'downturn', 'slam', 'entire', 'civil', 'sector', 'hammer', 'airframers', 'supplier', 'service', 'provider', 'chain', 'chicagobased', 'backlog', 'decline', 'april', 'customer', 'cancel', 'order', 'canadian', 'discounter', 'westjet', 'operates', 'fleet', 'deploy', 'primarily', 'transatlantic', 'route', 'include', 'already', 'disclose', 'termination', 'lessor', 'ge', 'capital', 'service', 'chinese', 'lessor', 'cdb', 'plus', 'cancel', 'unnamed', 'customer', 'accord', 'trim', 'backlog', 'another', 'jet', 'include', 'comply', 'accounting', 'standard', 'still', 'hold', 'sale', 'contract', 'less', 'confidence', 'sale', 'close', 'backlog', 'stood', 'end', 'april', 'month', 'earlier', 'manufacturer', 'stress', 'slump', 'delivery', 'figure', 'highlight', 'market', 'reality', 'effort', 'help', 'customer', 'adjust', 'globally', 'scramble', 'ground', 'thousand', 'jet', 'coronavirus', 'obliterate', 'travel', 'demand', 'similar', 'trend', 'deliver', 'april', 'yearonyear', 'likewise', 'attribute', 'april', 'cancellation', 'market', 'condition', 'effort', 'assist', 'customer', 'note', 'termination', 'others', 'ease', 'backlog', 'pressure', 'help', 'quickly', 'get', 'delivery', 'track', 'ground', 'lift', 'april', 'delivery', 'include', 'maritime', 'surveillance', 'comparison', 'airframer', 'deliver', 'april', 'month', 'skewed', 'ground', 'occur', 'march', 'jet', 'delivery', 'month', 'compare', 'delivery', 'period', 'receive', 'order', 'jet', 'cancellation', 'conversion', 'bring', 'yeartodate', 'net', 'order', 'negative', 'say']"
"Embraer delivered 14 aircraft during the first quarter of 2020, down more than 30% from the same period last year as the company carved out its commercial aircraft division for a now-scuppered sale to Boeing. The Brazilian planemaker says on 12 May it delivered five commercial aircraft and nine executive jets during the period. That is down from 11 commercial aircraft and 11 jets in the same quarter one year ago. The San Jose dos Campos-headquartered company blames the failed sale of its commercial aviation business to Boeing for the decline in deliveries. In March, Embraer said costs related to carving out its commercial business, some $120 million, would wipe out full-year 2019 earnings before interest and taxes. “Historically, Embraer seasonally has fewer deliveries during the first quarter of the year, and in 2020 in particular, the commercial aircraft deliveries in the first quarter were also negatively impacted by the conclusion of the separation of Embraer's commercial aviation unit in January,” the company says. Embraer also said today it had a backlog of $15.9 million at the end of March, down from $16.8 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019. The company's backlog data show that orders for 15 E175 jets have been cancelled since the end of 2019. The $4.2 billion Embraer-Boeing tie-up, announced in 2017, would have given Boeing 80% of the Brazilian company's commercial jet division. However, since the beginning of the year, as the coronavirus decimated the air transport industry, the company's stock plummeted about 65%, making the entire firm worth no more than $1.3 billion. Some industry analysts said in light of this decline, the valuation of the deal no longer made sense. In addition, the beleaguered US planemaker had hoped to get US government support to manage through the coronavirus crisis, which came on top of the company's 737 Max debacle. Some analysts thought the US government might frown on Boeing spending billions of dollars in Brazil immediately after receiving bailout funds. Boeing has still not announced having taken any US government financial aid. The sale, which had already been approved by several major regulatory bodies in Asia and the Americas, had been due to close this year. The companies were awaiting the European Commission's ruling, due in August. It was called off completely after Boeing terminated the master transaction agreement in late April. The US airframer said at the time that Embraer “did not satisfy the necessary conditions.” Embraer's executive jets arm also says on 12 May that its Phenom 300E received triple-certification from regulators in Brazil, the United States and Europe during the quarter.",5,191,0.0,0.3913,"order, business, jet, delivery, production, customer, deliver, commercial, quarter, include","['embraer', 'deliver', 'quarter', 'period', 'carve', 'commercial', 'division', 'nowscuppered', 'sale', 'brazilian', 'planemaker', 'say', 'may', 'deliver', 'commercial', 'executive', 'jet', 'period', 'commercial', 'jet', 'quarter', 'ago', 'san', 'jose', 'camposheadquartered', 'blame', 'fail', 'sale', 'commercial', 'business', 'decline', 'delivery', 'march', 'embraer', 'say', 'cost', 'related', 'carve', 'commercial', 'business', 'wipe', 'fullyear', 'earnings', 'interest', 'tax', 'historically', 'embraer', 'seasonally', 'delivery', 'quarter', 'particular', 'commercial', 'delivery', 'quarter', 'negatively', 'impact', 'conclusion', 'separation', 'embraer', 'commercial', 'unit', 'january', 'say', 'embraer', 'say', 'today', 'backlog', 'end', 'march', 'fourth', 'quarter', 'backlog', 'data', 'order', 'jet', 'cancel', 'since', 'end', 'embraerboeing', 'tieup', 'announce', 'give', 'brazilian', 'commercial', 'jet', 'division', 'however', 'since', 'begin', 'coronavirus', 'decimate', 'transport', 'industry', 'stock', 'plummet', 'make', 'entire', 'firm', 'worth', 'industry', 'analyst', 'say', 'light', 'decline', 'valuation', 'deal', 'longer', 'make', 'sense', 'addition', 'beleaguer', 'u', 'planemaker', 'hop', 'get', 'u', 'government', 'support', 'manage', 'coronavirus', 'crisis', 'come', 'top', 'debacle', 'analyst', 'thought', 'u', 'government', 'might', 'frown', 'spending', 'dollar', 'brazil', 'immediately', 'receive', 'bailout', 'fund', 'still', 'announce', 'take', 'u', 'government', 'financial', 'aid', 'sale', 'already', 'approve', 'several', 'major', 'regulatory', 'body', 'asia', 'america', 'due', 'close', 'await', 'european', 'commission', 'ruling', 'due', 'august', 'call', 'completely', 'terminate', 'master', 'transaction', 'agreement', 'late', 'april', 'u', 'airframer', 'say', 'embraer', 'satisfy', 'necessary', 'embraer', 'executive', 'jet', 'arm', 'say', 'may', 'phenom', 'receive', 'triplecertification', 'regulator', 'brazil', 'united', 'state', 'europe', 'quarter']"
"Brussels Airlines is reducing the number of aircraft in its fleet by 30% and slashing its workforce by a quarter in response to the coronavirus crisis. Lufthansa Group's Belgian subsidiary said today that it must take “substantial and indispensable measures to guarantee the survival of the company” and to enable it to have a future after the pandemic. The airline says it will cut “marginally profitable and unprofitable routes” and reduce the number of aircraft in its fleet to 38 from 54. Cirium fleets data shows that Brussels Airlines operates a fleet of Airbus A319 and A320 narrowbodies in addition to 15 A330 widebodies. The carrier will cut 25% of its workforce and says it will try to “reduce the number of forced dismissals to an absolute minimum”. It adds that it has requested financial support from parent company Lufthansa and from the Belgian government. Air travel demand is expected to recover to a “new normal” in 2023, says Brussels Airlines, and by making these cuts the airline expects to “grow again in a profitable way” once demand returns. The airline temporarily suspended all flights on 21 March and is haemorrhaging €1 million ($1.1 million) a day in lost revenue and aircraft lease and maintenance costs. “We started the year 2020 with positive results in terms of number of passengers and revenues, and for this summer we planned a strong leisure offer as we could compensate part of the business we lost due to the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook Belgium. But the coronavirus pandemic is hitting Brussels Airlines extremely hard,” states chief executive Dieter Vranckx. He adds: “This unprecedented crisis has worsened our financial situation, obliging us to take substantial and indispensable measures. The restructuring is urgently needed in order to survive the current crisis and to become structurally competitive in the future.”",5,192,4.0,0.2034,"airport, fleet, service, data, carrier, operation, passenger, number, operate, operator","['brussels', 'reduce', 'number', 'fleet', 'slash', 'workforce', 'quarter', 'response', 'coronavirus', 'crisis', 'lufthansa', 'belgian', 'subsidiary', 'say', 'today', 'must', 'take', 'substantial', 'indispensable', 'measure', 'guarantee', 'survival', 'enable', 'future', 'pandemic', 'say', 'cut', 'marginally', 'profitable', 'unprofitable', 'route', 'reduce', 'number', 'fleet', 'fleet', 'data', 'brussels', 'operates', 'fleet', 'narrowbodies', 'addition', 'widebodies', 'carrier', 'cut', 'workforce', 'say', 'try', 'reduce', 'number', 'force', 'dismissal', 'absolute', 'minimum', 'add', 'request', 'financial', 'support', 'parent', 'lufthansa', 'belgian', 'government', 'travel', 'demand', 'expect', 'recover', 'normal', 'say', 'brussels', 'make', 'cut', 'expect', 'grow', 'profitable', 'way', 'demand', 'return', 'temporarily', 'suspend', 'march', 'haemorrhaging', 'day', 'lose', 'revenue', 'lease', 'maintenance', 'cost', 'start', 'positive', 'result', 'term', 'number', 'passenger', 'revenue', 'summer', 'plan', 'strong', 'leisure', 'offer', 'compensate', 'part', 'business', 'lose', 'due', 'bankruptcy', 'thomas', 'cook', 'belgium', 'coronavirus', 'pandemic', 'hit', 'brussels', 'extremely', 'hard', 'state', 'chief', 'executive', 'dieter', 'vranckx', 'add', 'unprecedented', 'crisis', 'worsen', 'financial', 'situation', 'oblige', 'u', 'take', 'substantial', 'indispensable', 'measure', 'restructuring', 'urgently', 'need', 'order', 'survive', 'current', 'crisis', 'become', 'structurally', 'competitive', 'future']"
"Mainline jet deliveries will be heading down significantly this year as the impact of the coronavirus takes its toll from both a demand and supply-chain perspective, warns BOC Aviation (BOCA) chief executive Robert Martin. Speaking during theLeasing Leaders on the Aviation Crisis webinar, organised on 7 May by FlightGlobal in association with IBA Group, Martin predicted that deliveries in 2020 would be “at lower end of the 600-1,000” range. This would mean that Airbus and Boeing's total deliveries would fall to their lowest levels since the 2002-2005 era when the two manufacturers were shipping 600-700 aircraft annually. Last year the two companies delivered 1,243 aircraft between them. Between them, Airbus and Boeing delivered 172 aircraft in the first quarter of 2020, with March being the first month when the impact of the coronavirus began to be fully felt. One imponderable parameter is when will the Boeing 737 Max return to service, and how many will be delivered this year. Explaining the rationale for his forecast, Martin says that delivery levels this year will not be determined entirely by “the demand side”. “There are also issues in the supply chain...which will also impact the number of aircraft that can be delivered this year,” says Martin. “All the way down the supply chain, companies are having to adjust to the new reality. Airbus has come down by roughly a third and Covid-19 has unfortunately meant that a number of the factories have had to close down or change the way they work.” Martin believes that the sector into which many 2020 deliveries were headed will also influence the ability of customers to take new aircraft. “On the demand side, a fair number were due to go to the low-cost carriers - the people who haven't been active in the debt capital markets and equity markets during Covid-19,” he says. “So when you add those two points together I think we're at the lower end of the 600-1,000 deliveries this year.” Fellow panellist Firoz Tarapore, chief executive of Dubai Aerospace Enterprise, concurred with Martin's outlook assessment. “The next two months are very critical for everybody in making a determination about the effectiveness of this partial reopening around the world,” he says. “If there is a setback or the 'new normal' is some sort of distancing and/or social behaviour mechanism then that will have a fairly large and negative implication for the rest of the year. But if the next two months go well, there is a potential acceleration that we can see.” Tarapore adds that with so many uncertainties around the virus and “everything that Boeing is going through...it's hard to see [2020 deliveries] getting up to be a very robust number.” The Leasing Leaders on Aviation Crisis will be available to listen on demand atflightglobal.com/webinars",5,193,9.0,0.2188,"industry, crisis, demand, coronavirus, global, iata, market, level, cargo, expect","['mainline', 'jet', 'delivery', 'head', 'significantly', 'impact', 'coronavirus', 'take', 'toll', 'demand', 'supplychain', 'perspective', 'warns', 'boc', 'boca', 'chief', 'executive', 'robert', 'martin', 'speak', 'theleasing', 'leader', 'crisis', 'webinar', 'organise', 'may', 'flightglobal', 'association', 'iba', 'martin', 'predict', 'delivery', 'low', 'end', 'range', 'mean', 'total', 'delivery', 'fall', 'low', 'level', 'since', 'era', 'manufacturer', 'shipping', 'annually', 'deliver', 'deliver', 'quarter', 'march', 'month', 'impact', 'coronavirus', 'begin', 'fully', 'felt', 'imponderable', 'parameter', 'return', 'service', 'many', 'deliver', 'explain', 'rationale', 'forecast', 'martin', 'say', 'delivery', 'level', 'determine', 'entirely', 'demand', 'side', 'issue', 'supply', 'chain', 'impact', 'number', 'deliver', 'say', 'martin', 'way', 'supply', 'chain', 'adjust', 'reality', 'come', 'roughly', 'third', 'coronavirus', 'unfortunately', 'meant', 'number', 'factory', 'close', 'change', 'way', 'martin', 'believe', 'sector', 'many', 'delivery', 'head', 'influence', 'ability', 'customer', 'take', 'demand', 'side', 'fair', 'number', 'due', 'go', 'lowcost', 'carrier', 'people', 'active', 'debt', 'capital', 'market', 'equity', 'market', 'coronavirus', 'say', 'add', 'point', 'together', 'think', 'low', 'end', 'delivery', 'fellow', 'panellist', 'firoz', 'tarapore', 'chief', 'executive', 'dubai', 'enterprise', 'concur', 'martin', 'outlook', 'assessment', 'next', 'month', 'critical', 'everybody', 'make', 'determination', 'effectiveness', 'partial', 'reopen', 'around', 'world', 'say', 'setback', 'normal', 'sort', 'distance', 'social', 'behaviour', 'mechanism', 'fairly', 'large', 'negative', 'implication', 'rest', 'next', 'month', 'go', 'well', 'potential', 'acceleration', 'tarapore', 'add', 'many', 'uncertainty', 'around', 'virus', 'everything', 'go', 'hard', 'see', 'delivery', 'get', 'robust', 'lease', 'leader', 'crisis', 'available', 'listen', 'demand']"
"Mitsubishi Aircraft's parent company will review the development of a 76-seater variant of its regional jet programme nearly a year after its launch, as full-year losses related to the programme widened. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) will also halve the budget allocated for the SpaceJet regional aircraft programme to Y60 billion ($558 million) for the year ending 31 March 2021. In its full-year results presentation, MHI states that it is “setting an appropriate level of budget” for the SpaceJet programme in the new financial year. The final budget of Y60 billion takes into account impairment losses from the acquisition of Bombardier's CRJ programme, which amount to between Y50 and 70 billion. The deal, announced in June last year, will close by 1 June this year. On the M100's development progress, MHI tells FlightGlobal: “While we evaluate the state of global aviation, it has been determined to reconsider the process of the SpaceJet M100 feasibility study.” The Japanese firm adds that it “remains committed” to move the development of the baseline, 90-seater M90 variant forward. The SpaceJet M100 was launched at the Paris air show in 2019 and is targeted at the USA regional market. It was designed to meet take-off weight limits for 76-seat aircraft as stipulated by major US airlines' pilot contracts. Mitsubishi has already seen the M90's service entry timeline move further to the right. At present, the first M90 will be delivered to launch customer All Nippon Airways by April 2021, or later. MHI says that the coronavirus impact, which hit the company from March, forced it to suspend type certification test flights at its Moses Lake facility in the US. The ferry flight for M90 Flight Test Vehicle 10 (FTV10) – the first example of the M90 produced in what the company calls its “new, certifiable baseline design” – to the US also had to be delayed as a result of the outbreak. SpaceJet-related losses for the year ended 31 March widened to Y263.3 billion, more than triple the Y85.1 billion loss it incurred the previous year. MHI's aircraft, defence and space unit, in which the SpaceJet programme resides, saw its full-year operating loss increase to Y209 billion from a Y37.4 billion loss reported the previous year. Revenue for the unit went up about 4% to Y705 billion, on the back of increased takings from defence aircraft and missile systems. The unit's overall order value for the period increased 17.8% to Y719 billion, also due to its space systems, defence aircraft and missile systems portfolios. As a result of losses from the SpaceJet programme, MHI plunged into the red for its full-year results, reporting an operating loss of Y29.5 billion. This contrasts with the Y186.7 billion profit it made the previous fiscal year. On the “changing business landscape”, MHI has flagged “significant” near-term impact on its commercial aircraft and engines business, due to the coronavirus outbreak. It notes that while Boeing – for which MHI is a tier one supplier – has resumed production of aircraft following factory closures to mitigate the pandemic's spread, but “uncertainty surrounds production rates”.

"ATR has become the latest manufacturer to develop a solution that enables operators to adapt passenger aircraft for cargo flights, in an effort to help airlines return assets to service. The airframer – jointly owned by Airbus and Italian aerospace group Leonardo – says 60% of the global ATR fleet is not in active service today. Cirium fleets data shows that 506 ATR 42/72 turboprops are in service, while 781 are listed as being in storage. Among the in-storage fleet are 426 ATR 72-600s and 32 ATR 42-600s representing 76% of all 600-series aircraft – ATR's current product line. Some 119 ATR 72-600s and 24 ATR 42-600s are listed as being in service. Airlines have been using passenger aircraft for cargo-only flights – with some operators taking out seats to store freight pallets – amid the collapse in belly-freight capacity caused by the coronavirus crisis. ATR says its newly developed cargo solution enables operators to “quickly and temporarily convert [aircraft] to a light freighter configuration” and to “unlock potential operations”. The manufacturer disclosed today that it had delivered 68 aircraft and taken 79 orders in 2019. In 2018, ATR delivered 76 aircraft and won 52 orders. Revenue declined to $1.6 billion last year, from $1.8 billion in 2018. However, ATR says sales were “boosted” by its services division. Aftermarket support is an increasing focus of aerospace manufacturers in general. ATR notes that, despite the coronavirus crisis, customers have not cancelled orders “to date”, but warns: “It is too early to understand the full impact on our backlog.” Cirium fleets data shows customers have 228 ATR-family aircraft on order and hold 103 options. The manufacturer says it is committed to the development of a short take-off and landing (STOL) variant of the ATR 42-600, and a freighter version of the ATR 72-600 of which deliveries are set to begin later this year. Following a four-day production suspension in March to prepare the manufacturer's Toulouse facility for operations during the pandemic, ATR has continued aircraft production – albeit at a reduced rate – and is providing support for the in-service fleet. “We have implemented a very strict health protocol that has allowed us to continue critical activities.” ATR expects that regional operators – which it credits with playing “huge role” in “connecting communities around the world with necessary supplies” – will restart flights faster than international airlines.",5,195,0.0,0.2894,"order, business, jet, delivery, production, customer, deliver, commercial, quarter, include","['atr', 'become', 'late', 'manufacturer', 'develop', 'solution', 'enables', 'operator', 'adapt', 'passenger', 'cargo', 'effort', 'help', 'return', 'asset', 'service', 'airframer', 'jointly', 'italian', 'leonardo', 'say', 'global', 'atr', 'fleet', 'active', 'service', 'today', 'fleet', 'data', 'atr', 'turboprop', 'service', 'list', 'storage', 'among', 'instorage', 'fleet', 'atr', 'atr', 'represent', 'atr', 'current', 'product', 'line', 'atr', 'atr', 'list', 'service', 'use', 'passenger', 'cargoonly', 'operator', 'take', 'seat', 'store', 'freight', 'pallet', 'amid', 'collapse', 'bellyfreight', 'capacity', 'cause', 'coronavirus', 'crisis', 'atr', 'say', 'newly', 'developed', 'cargo', 'solution', 'enables', 'operator', 'quickly', 'temporarily', 'convert', 'light', 'freighter', 'configuration', 'unlock', 'potential', 'operation', 'manufacturer', 'disclose', 'today', 'deliver', 'take', 'order', 'atr', 'deliver', 'order', 'revenue', 'decline', 'however', 'atr', 'say', 'sale', 'boost', 'service', 'division', 'aftermarket', 'support', 'increase', 'focus', 'manufacturer', 'general', 'atr', 'note', 'despite', 'coronavirus', 'crisis', 'customer', 'cancel', 'order', 'date', 'warns', 'early', 'understand', 'full', 'impact', 'fleet', 'data', 'customer', 'atrfamily', 'order', 'hold', 'option', 'manufacturer', 'say', 'commit', 'development', 'short', 'takeoff', 'land', 'stol', 'variant', 'atr', 'freighter', 'version', 'atr', 'delivery', 'set', 'begin', 'later', 'follow', 'fourday', 'production', 'suspension', 'march', 'prepare', 'manufacturer', 'toulouse', 'facility', 'operation', 'pandemic', 'atr', 'continued', 'production', 'albeit', 'reduce', 'rate', 'provide', 'support', 'inservice', 'fleet', 'implement', 'strict', 'health', 'protocol', 'allow', 'u', 'continue', 'critical', 'atr', 'expect', 'regional', 'operator', 'credit', 'play', 'huge', 'role', 'connect', 'community', 'around', 'world', 'necessary', 'supply', 'restart', 'faster', 'international']"
"Slovenia's government is lifting restrictions on passenger air transport in the country, having imposed a comprehensive ban in the wake of the coronavirus crisis. The government says it will “withdraw the measures” on 12 May after deciding “not to extend” the limitation. It says the decree prohibited provision of international air transport of passengers from all countries to Slovenia, including within the European Union. But the government states that measures have since been introduced to protect public health which must be met by airport operators and airlines, while there are also requirements – such as compulsory quarantine – to be followed by returning citizens and foreign visitors. Slovenia's government says there remains a risk to public health and, as a result, it is maintaining a ban on general aviation flights to significant airports with international air traffic connections. Flag-carrier Adria Airways collapsed in September last year and, prior to the coronavirus crisis, international connections were being maintained by foreign operators. Slovenia's main airport, Ljubljana, is managed by Fraport Slovenia, which has welcomed the easing of restrictions. “Most airlines cancelled passenger flights to our airport by the end of May,” the company states. “Regardless of this fact, in the past few days we have been preparing for the reception of the first passengers and installed necessary safety measures to restart passenger traffic.”",5,196,12.0,0.3952,"travel, government, country, coronavirus, measure, restriction, passenger, state, march, canada","['slovenia', 'government', 'lift', 'restriction', 'passenger', 'transport', 'country', 'impose', 'comprehensive', 'ban', 'wake', 'coronavirus', 'crisis', 'government', 'say', 'withdraw', 'measure', 'may', 'decide', 'extend', 'limitation', 'say', 'decree', 'prohibit', 'provision', 'international', 'transport', 'passenger', 'country', 'slovenia', 'include', 'within', 'european', 'union', 'government', 'state', 'measure', 'since', 'introduce', 'protect', 'public', 'health', 'must', 'met', 'airport', 'operator', 'requirement', 'compulsory', 'quarantine', 'follow', 'return', 'citizen', 'foreign', 'visitor', 'slovenia', 'government', 'say', 'remains', 'risk', 'public', 'health', 'result', 'maintain', 'ban', 'general', 'significant', 'airport', 'international', 'traffic', 'connection', 'flagcarrier', 'adria', 'airway', 'collapse', 'september', 'prior', 'coronavirus', 'crisis', 'international', 'connection', 'maintain', 'foreign', 'operator', 'slovenia', 'main', 'airport', 'ljubljana', 'manage', 'fraport', 'slovenia', 'welcome', 'ease', 'restriction', 'cancel', 'passenger', 'airport', 'end', 'may', 'state', 'regardless', 'fact', 'past', 'day', 'prepare', 'reception', 'passenger', 'instal', 'necessary', 'safety', 'measure', 'restart', 'passenger', 'traffic']"
"Leonardo Helicopters is turning to technology to enable customer shipments despite the travel restrictions imposed by the coronavirus crisis which have caused a build-up of completed but undelivered aircraft at its production sites. The Italian company's helicopter division was one of the parts of the business most acutely affected by the Covid-19 pandemic during the first quarter: civil deliveries slumped to 11 units, down on the 19 shipments it made in the same period a year earlier. Although output has largely been maintained at pre-coronavirus levels, clients have been unable or unwilling to travel to northern Italy to collect the assembled helicopters. But speaking on a first-quarter earnings call on 7 May, Alessandra Genco, group chief financial officer, said the division was considering new solutions to clear the log-jam of undelivered aircraft, which are largely AW139 intermediate-twins. “In helicopters we are getting ready to do 'smart deliveries' – using the digital set-up to transfer to customers all the data relating to the final testing we have done on their machines,” she says. “This will make them comfortable that the machine is in good shape, as if their own pilots had tested it, and therefore on that basis take delivery of the aircraft.” A similar scheme is already in operation by Airbus at its commercial aviation unit. However, although progress is being made on the initiative, she cautions not to expect any “significant speed up” of deliveries until June at the earliest. Revenues at the division slumped year on year by 13.4%, to €704 million ($761 million), contributing to a 68% plunge in EBITA, to €18 million. Nonetheless, Leonardo Helicopters added €1.48 billion to its backlog during the quarter, largely driven by the defence sector. This included 32 TH-119s for the US Navy, following the January selection of the light-single as the service's new trainer, designated the TH-73A. Leonardo has a significant presence in northern Italy, which has been the part of the country worst affected by the coronavirus outbreak. Despite this, the group has not furloughed any of its around 31,000 staff in the country, says chief executive Alessandro Profumo. At the end of April, 40% of its employees were on site, 43% were working remotely and the remaining 17% were absent, he says.",5,197,0.0,0.2347,"order, business, jet, delivery, production, customer, deliver, commercial, quarter, include","['leonardo', 'helicopter', 'turn', 'technology', 'enable', 'customer', 'shipment', 'despite', 'travel', 'restriction', 'impose', 'coronavirus', 'crisis', 'cause', 'buildup', 'complete', 'undelivered', 'production', 'site', 'italian', 'helicopter', 'division', 'part', 'business', 'acutely', 'affected', 'coronavirus', 'pandemic', 'quarter', 'civil', 'delivery', 'slump', 'unit', 'shipment', 'make', 'period', 'earlier', 'although', 'output', 'largely', 'maintain', 'precoronavirus', 'level', 'client', 'unable', 'unwilling', 'travel', 'northern', 'italy', 'collect', 'assemble', 'helicopter', 'speak', 'firstquarter', 'earnings', 'call', 'may', 'alessandra', 'genco', 'chief', 'financial', 'officer', 'say', 'division', 'consider', 'solution', 'clear', 'logjam', 'undelivered', 'largely', 'intermediatetwins', 'helicopter', 'get', 'ready', 'delivery', 'use', 'digital', 'setup', 'transfer', 'customer', 'data', 'relate', 'final', 'test', 'machine', 'say', 'make', 'comfortable', 'machine', 'good', 'shape', 'pilot', 'test', 'therefore', 'basis', 'take', 'delivery', 'similar', 'scheme', 'already', 'operation', 'commercial', 'unit', 'however', 'although', 'progress', 'make', 'initiative', 'caution', 'expect', 'significant', 'speed', 'delivery', 'june', 'early', 'revenue', 'division', 'slump', 'contribute', 'plunge', 'ebita', 'nonetheless', 'leonardo', 'helicopter', 'add', 'backlog', 'quarter', 'largely', 'driven', 'defence', 'sector', 'include', 'u', 'navy', 'follow', 'january', 'selection', 'lightsingle', 'service', 'trainer', 'designate', 'leonardo', 'significant', 'presence', 'northern', 'italy', 'part', 'country', 'bad', 'affected', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'despite', 'furlough', 'around', 'staff', 'country', 'say', 'chief', 'executive', 'alessandro', 'profumo', 'end', 'april', 'employee', 'site', 'work', 'remotely', 'remain', 'absent', 'say']"
"Leading aircraft lessor chiefs see the coronavirus crisis increasing the likelihood of consolidation among aircraft leasing companies. Speaking during the Leasing Leaders on the Aviation Crisis webinar, organised on 7 May by FlightGlobal in association with IBA Group, Dubai Aerospace Enterprise chief executive Firoz Tarapore said: “We have said for the last three years that the leasing space is due for consolidation. But the reasons we have articulated for that are different.... than the reasons we would say now. ”This time around, for folks who are newcomers in quotes – in the last five to 10 years – there is a subset of that group that I think will come to realise the complexity and financial uncertainty of managing through a full life-cycle of the aircraft. And while no willing seller, if they can afford to hang on, will exit at the kind of losses they would have to take at the current, time, I would say if they can afford to wait it out a little bit while prices recover, they will. ”Consolidation is inevitable,” he adds. ”The question is over what timeframe and the pain threshold – which is linked directly to the level of preparedness – that is in the balance sheet of some of these companies.” Chief executive of BOC Aviation, Robert Martin, notes that among traditional lessors, consolidation will be driven by the wider strategies or financing requirements of the parent. ”If we see consolidation, it tends to be the owner – for its own reasons – wants to sell out,” he says, citing the examples of AIG with ILFC after the financial crisis, and CIT selling its leasing business. ”The other thing to watch out for is where we have big debt balloons or maturities. Sometimes that may force a leasing company into some restructuring with its banks and that can lead to some kind of consolidation,” he says. ”As a leasing company your achilles heel is the liability side of the balance sheet. This has always been the thing that has killed lessors in previous downturns,” Martin says. ”The key thing is ...to not have big debt balloons falling because that is where you become very subject to what is going on either in the capital markets or in the banking market.” But he does see other areas of the leasing market where consolidation is likely, such as airline-owned leasing companies. ”I don't think they will survive this downturn. This is a financial business and the airlines will retreat to their core business during this period. What you tend to find is during a downturn, people will defend their core business.” Citing some of the disposals over the past year with AirAsia and Norwegian's leasing arms, he says: ”I think that trend has already begun long before Covid.” Martin adds: ”We have had an explosion of ABS vehicles over the past two to three years. As we go through this downturn, what happens to those? Unlike a traditional leasing company that can add additional assets, generally they don't have that option, so how do those companies go through [merger & acquisitions]? ”There is also a large amount of assets sitting in warehouse facilities that were due to go into ABS deals – so what happens to those as well. So I think we are going to see a lot of activity in that [area].” The Leasing Leaders on Aviation Crisis will be available to listen on demand atflightglobal.com/webinars",5,198,9.0,0.2261,"industry, crisis, demand, coronavirus, global, iata, market, level, cargo, expect","['lead', 'lessor', 'chief', 'see', 'coronavirus', 'crisis', 'increase', 'likelihood', 'consolidation', 'among', 'lease', 'speak', 'lease', 'leader', 'crisis', 'webinar', 'organise', 'may', 'flightglobal', 'association', 'iba', 'dubai', 'enterprise', 'chief', 'executive', 'firoz', 'tarapore', 'say', 'say', 'lease', 'space', 'due', 'consolidation', 'reason', 'articulate', 'different', 'reason', 'say', 'around', 'folk', 'newcomer', 'quote', 'subset', 'think', 'come', 'realise', 'complexity', 'financial', 'uncertainty', 'manage', 'full', 'lifecycle', 'willing', 'seller', 'afford', 'hang', 'exit', 'kind', 'loss', 'take', 'current', 'say', 'afford', 'wait', 'little', 'bit', 'price', 'recover', 'consolidation', 'inevitable', 'add', 'question', 'timeframe', 'pain', 'threshold', 'link', 'directly', 'level', 'preparedness', 'balance', 'sheet', 'chief', 'executive', 'boc', 'robert', 'martin', 'note', 'among', 'traditional', 'lessor', 'consolidation', 'driven', 'wider', 'strategy', 'financing', 'requirement', 'parent', 'see', 'consolidation', 'tends', 'owner', 'reason', 'want', 'sell', 'say', 'cite', 'example', 'aig', 'ilfc', 'financial', 'crisis', 'cit', 'sell', 'lease', 'business', 'thing', 'watch', 'big', 'debt', 'balloon', 'maturity', 'sometimes', 'may', 'force', 'lease', 'restructuring', 'bank', 'lead', 'kind', 'consolidation', 'say', 'lease', 'achilles', 'heel', 'liability', 'side', 'balance', 'sheet', 'always', 'thing', 'kill', 'lessor', 'previous', 'downturn', 'martin', 'say', 'key', 'thing', 'big', 'debt', 'balloon', 'fall', 'become', 'subject', 'go', 'either', 'capital', 'market', 'banking', 'see', 'area', 'lease', 'market', 'consolidation', 'likely', 'airlineowned', 'lease', 'think', 'survive', 'downturn', 'financial', 'business', 'retreat', 'core', 'business', 'period', 'tend', 'find', 'downturn', 'people', 'defend', 'core', 'cite', 'disposal', 'past', 'airasia', 'norwegian', 'lease', 'arm', 'say', 'think', 'trend', 'already', 'begin', 'long', 'martin', 'add', 'explosion', 'ab', 'vehicle', 'past', 'go', 'downturn', 'happens', 'unlike', 'traditional', 'lease', 'add', 'additional', 'asset', 'generally', 'option', 'go', 'merger', 'acquisition', 'large', 'amount', 'asset', 'sit', 'warehouse', 'facility', 'due', 'go', 'ab', 'deal', 'happens', 'well', 'think', 'go', 'see', 'lot', 'activity', 'area', 'lease', 'leader', 'crisis', 'available', 'listen', 'demand']"

"Airline and cockpit crew representatives have condemned indications by UK prime minister Boris Johnson that he is prepared to introduce quarantine measures for inbound passengers to the UK. Johnson spoke on 10 May, outlining “conditional” steps towards easing the lockdown imposed on the country in March following the coronavirus outbreak. “To prevent re-infection from abroad, I'm serving notice that it will soon be the time – with transmission significantly lower – to impose quarantine on people coming into this country by air,” he said. Johnson added that the government would “not hesitate to put on the brakes” if the situation deteriorated. Carrier association Airlines UK and pilots' union BALPA, however, have sharply criticised the possible introduction of a 14-day quarantine requirement. “We all, including government, need to adapt to the 'new normal',” says Airlines UK chief Tim Alderslade. “But closing off air travel in this way is not the way to achieve this. “Ministers are effectively telling people they can no longer travel for the foreseeable future and airlines will respond to that by grounding their operations.” BALPA has expressed scepticism over the mooted quarantine of passengers, adding that it has seen neither the scientific basis for the proposal nor any risk assessment for crews' health. The commercial impact, like other aspects of the proposition, “have not been thoroughly thought through”, it adds. BALPA general secretary Brian Strutton says the union is seeking details on the government's plan for commercial aviation, saying there are “too many open questions” and a quarantine proposal will “put even more pressure on the industry”. Airlines UK has been urging government support for the industry including extension of job-retention initiatives and deferral of air passenger duty, air navigation charges, and other fees. The Board of Airline Representatives in the UK, which represents carriers serving the country, says a considered plan would need to replace any quarantine measure. “Flying can only recommence in any meaningful way once the 14-day self-isolation requirement is superseded by a carefully co-ordinated and internationally-harmonised approach,” says BAR UK chief executive Dale Keller. Such an approach, he says, would incorporate a series of “multi-layered and more effective measures” to target and mitigate risk and provide “the confidence that flying is safe”.",5,200,12.0,0.2771,"travel, government, country, coronavirus, measure, restriction, passenger, state, march, canada","['cockpit', 'crew', 'representative', 'condemn', 'indication', 'uk', 'prime', 'minister', 'boris', 'johnson', 'prepared', 'introduce', 'quarantine', 'measure', 'inbound', 'passenger', 'uk', 'johnson', 'spoke', 'may', 'outline', 'conditional', 'step', 'towards', 'ease', 'lockdown', 'impose', 'country', 'march', 'follow', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'prevent', 'reinfection', 'abroad', 'serve', 'notice', 'soon', 'transmission', 'significantly', 'low', 'impose', 'quarantine', 'people', 'come', 'country', 'say', 'johnson', 'add', 'government', 'hesitate', 'put', 'brake', 'situation', 'deteriorate', 'carrier', 'association', 'uk', 'pilot', 'union', 'balpa', 'however', 'sharply', 'criticise', 'possible', 'introduction', 'quarantine', 'requirement', 'include', 'government', 'need', 'adapt', 'normal', 'say', 'uk', 'chief', 'tim', 'alderslade', 'closing', 'travel', 'way', 'way', 'achieve', 'minister', 'effectively', 'tell', 'people', 'longer', 'travel', 'foreseeable', 'future', 'respond', 'ground', 'balpa', 'express', 'scepticism', 'moot', 'quarantine', 'passenger', 'add', 'see', 'neither', 'scientific', 'basis', 'proposal', 'risk', 'assessment', 'crew', 'health', 'commercial', 'impact', 'like', 'aspect', 'proposition', 'thoroughly', 'thought', 'add', 'balpa', 'general', 'secretary', 'brian', 'strutton', 'say', 'union', 'seek', 'detail', 'government', 'plan', 'commercial', 'say', 'many', 'open', 'question', 'quarantine', 'proposal', 'put', 'even', 'pressure', 'industry', 'uk', 'urge', 'government', 'support', 'industry', 'include', 'extension', 'jobretention', 'initiative', 'deferral', 'passenger', 'duty', 'navigation', 'charge', 'fee', 'board', 'representative', 'uk', 'represent', 'carrier', 'serve', 'country', 'say', 'consider', 'plan', 'need', 'replace', 'quarantine', 'measure', 'fly', 'recommence', 'meaningful', 'way', 'selfisolation', 'requirement', 'supersede', 'carefully', 'coordinate', 'internationallyharmonised', 'approach', 'say', 'bar', 'uk', 'chief', 'executive', 'dale', 'keller', 'approach', 'say', 'incorporate', 'series', 'multilayered', 'effective', 'measure', 'target', 'mitigate', 'risk', 'provide', 'confidence', 'fly', 'safe']"
"Middle Eastern operator Emirates Group is expecting that recovery from the coronavirus crisis will take at least 18 months, as it braces for a “huge impact” on its 2020-21 performance. The Dubai-based company's passenger operations were suspended a few days before the close of its financial year on 31 March, while its Dnata ground-handling division has also been affected by the depletion of traffic. Chief executive Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum says the group had been “performing strongly” for the first 11 months of its 2019-20 financial year, before the situation “changed rapidly” around mid-February. “We expect it will take 18 months at least, before travel demand returns to a semblance of normality,” he says. “We are actively engaging with regulators and relevant stakeholders, as they work to define standards to ensure the health and safety of travellers and operators in a post-pandemic world.” Emirates Group's full-year finances were also affected by last year's April-May closure of one of Dubai's runways for maintenance work. This closure and the effects of the pandemic towards the tail-end of its fiscal year contributed to a 4.8% decline in revenues to Dhs104 billion ($28 billion), as Emirates' airline revenues slipped by 6% – although Dnata revenues increased by 2.4%. While Emirates' profit increased by 21% to Dhs1.06 billion, however, Dnata's more than halved to Dhs618 million, and Emirates Group's overall profit was down by 28% to Dhs1.67 billion. Profit would have been higher, it claims, but for a Dhs1.1 billion loss arising from year-end fuel-hedge ineffectiveness. Although total operating costs fell by 10% - partly driven by a fall in fuel price – the company adds that the strength of the US dollar had a Dhs963 million negative effect on its bottom line, more than the previous year's impact of Dhs572 million.

"South African Airways is to continue conducting services for the time being, defying the 8 May date for cessation of operations given by the airline's business rescue practitioners Unions are claiming a Labour Court victory after they brought a case to halt a retrenchment process for the carrier's personnel. SAA says it will “continue to operate” repatriation and cargo flights during May “and beyond”. “We are responding pro-actively in those instances where there is a need for essential humanitarian cargo for our country and for the neighbouring states to be uplifted,” says interim SAA executive chair Thandeka Mgoduso. SAA adds that it will “honour all existing commitments” to provide air transportation services to its customers, pointing out that it has received requests for repatriation from several regions including the Middle East, the Americas, and Asia. Union NUMSA and the cabin crew association SACCA have “secured a victory” against “unfair” retrenchments following an urgent application at the Labour Court, says NUMSA general secretary Irvin Jim. The South African Federation of Trade Unions, with which NUMSA is affiliated, says that the action has “stopped the...business rescue practitioners [in] their tracks”. “It was always irrational and illogical for the [practitioners] to rush retrenchments without first producing the rescue plan,” adds the federation, accusing the government of failing to protect citizens' interests. SAA's rescue practitioners had opposed the unions' court application but have yet to detail their next steps in the saga.

"Singapore Airlines' MRO unit has warned that the pace of recovery from the coronavirus downturn is “unclear” but will be slow, with base, engine and component maintenance likely to be impacted in coming months. Releasing annual results for the year ending 31 March, SIA Engineering (SIAEC) says its line maintenance business was hardest hit by widespread airline cancellations and travel restrictions in the first few months of 2020. The MRO provider calls March particularly tough. Owing to travel restrictions and flight cancellations, line maintenance work at its main Singapore base was half its usual workload. SIAEC's revenue from fleet management, which is based on flying hours, was “similarly impacted”, it adds. Base maintenance, as well as engine and component segments, were “not immediately affected” during the last quarter of the financial year, but SIAEC expects financial impact in the coming months. The MRO posted a full-year operating profit of S$67.7 million ($47.9 million), a 19% year-on-year increase reflecting strong financial performance in the first nine months of the financial year, SIAEC says. Revenue for the year dipped a marginal 2.6% to S$994 million. Expenses fell 3.9% to S$926 million due partly to reduced staff and material costs. Net profit increased 20.5% to S$194 million. SIAEC ended the financial year with about S$520 million in cash and cash equivalents, slightly less than the S$522 it had one year earlier. The coronavirus outbreak squeezed SIAEC in the quarter ending 31 March, with operating profit down 26% year-on-year to S$14.3 million. Quarterly revenue fell 10% to S$229 million due mostly to less line- and airframe-maintenance work, while expenses sank 9.1% to S$215 million. Net profit for the period rose nearly 6% to S$52.2 million. The MRO says the pace of recovery is unclear “but is expected to be slow”. Recovery will depend on how soon traffic returns, especially to its main base at Singapore's Changi Airport. “While regulated mandatory aircraft checks are still ongoing, the reduction in flying hours and subsequent extended maintenance intervals will have an impact, albeit delayed, on our base maintenance unit and our [engine and component] joint ventures,” SIAEC adds. It stressed that its balance sheet remains healthy, with a strong cash position and minimal debt. SIAEC adds it will continue working on its “transformation journey” to increase productivity and cut costs, and will review investments.",5,203,3.0,0.4053,"passenger, loss, operating, revenue, traffic, month, increase, capacity, decline, result","['singapore', 'mro', 'unit', 'warn', 'pace', 'recovery', 'coronavirus', 'downturn', 'unclear', 'slow', 'base', 'engine', 'component', 'maintenance', 'likely', 'impact', 'come', 'month', 'release', 'annual', 'result', 'end', 'march', 'sia', 'engineering', 'siaec', 'say', 'line', 'maintenance', 'business', 'hardest', 'hit', 'widespread', 'cancellation', 'travel', 'restriction', 'month', 'mro', 'provider', 'call', 'march', 'particularly', 'tough', 'owe', 'travel', 'restriction', 'cancellation', 'line', 'maintenance', 'work', 'main', 'singapore', 'base', 'half', 'usual', 'workload', 'siaec', 'revenue', 'fleet', 'management', 'base', 'fly', 'hour', 'similarly', 'impact', 'add', 'base', 'maintenance', 'well', 'engine', 'component', 'segment', 'immediately', 'affected', 'quarter', 'financial', 'siaec', 'expect', 'financial', 'impact', 'come', 'month', 'mro', 'post', 'fullyear', 'operating', 'profit', 'yearonyear', 'increase', 'reflect', 'strong', 'financial', 'performance', 'month', 'financial', 'siaec', 'say', 'revenue', 'dipped', 'marginal', 'expense', 'fell', 'due', 'partly', 'reduce', 'staff', 'material', 'cost', 'net', 'profit', 'increase', 'siaec', 'end', 'financial', 'cash', 'cash', 'equivalent', 'slightly', 'less', 'earlier', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'squeeze', 'siaec', 'quarter', 'end', 'march', 'operating', 'profit', 'yearonyear', 'quarterly', 'revenue', 'fell', 'due', 'mostly', 'less', 'line', 'airframemaintenance', 'work', 'expense', 'sank', 'net', 'profit', 'period', 'rise', 'nearly', 'mro', 'say', 'pace', 'recovery', 'unclear', 'expect', 'slow', 'recovery', 'depend', 'soon', 'traffic', 'return', 'especially', 'main', 'base', 'singapore', 'changi', 'airport', 'regulate', 'mandatory', 'check', 'still', 'ongoing', 'reduction', 'fly', 'hour', 'subsequent', 'extend', 'maintenance', 'interval', 'impact', 'albeit', 'delayed', 'base', 'maintenance', 'unit', 'engine', 'component', 'joint', 'venture', 'siaec', 'add', 'stress', 'balance', 'sheet', 'remains', 'healthy', 'strong', 'cash', 'position', 'minimal', 'debt', 'siaec', 'add', 'continue', 'work', 'transformation', 'journey', 'increase', 'productivity', 'cut', 'cost', 'review', 'investment']"
"Circumstances of the fatal runway incident at Austin-Bergstrom airport which involved an arriving Southwest Airlines Boeing 737 have yet to become clear, with air-ground communications providing little further detail on the sequence of events. The airport's operator has described the area in which the 7 May incident took place as a “crime scene”, without elaborating. Flight WN1392's crew had informed Austin controllers the aircraft was approaching the JEDYE waypoint ahead of an ILS approach to runway 17R, and the jet was subsequently cleared to land. After the 737 had rolled out another aircraft – a Delta Air Lines Airbus A220, operating as DL819 – was also cleared to land on the same runway. But after tower controllers started giving taxi instructions to the Southwest crew, one of the pilots interrupted and then stated: “We believe there might be a person on the runway.” The Delta A220 was instructed to execute a missed approach and climb to 3,000ft before the controller asked the Southwest pilot for more details: “Where exactly do you see the man?” “Well they're...they're behind us now,” the pilot replied. “So you saw them just after you touched down?” the controller asked, which the pilot confirmed. After being given discretion to continue to the parking stand, via the G and G2 taxiways, the pilot stated that the aircraft would hold on taxiway G for a time. A subsequent communication with ground personnel refers to the Southwest report and suggests the crew had “spotted someone on foot” on the runway. The radio transmissions were archived by LiveATC. Southwest Airlines says the aircraft “manoeuvred to avoid” an individual who “appeared” on runway 17R shortly after the aircraft touched down at about 20:12 – around sunset in Austin. None of the occupants of the jet was injured. The carrier states that it is “fully co-operating” with local law enforcement and the US FAA as the incident is investigated. Austin-Travis county emergency medical services stated that it responded at 20:22 to a report of a “person possibly struck by an airplane on a runway” and subsequently mentioned a “deceased on scene” pronouncement for an adult patient, with no further information. Austin Police, to which the US National Transportation Safety Board has delegated the investigation, has confirmed that the male victim “did not have authorisation to access the airfield”, nor was he an employee of the airport in possession of an airport security access badge. “Additional details about the identity of the individual or what they were doing on the airfield are unavailable, as the investigation into the incident is still ongoing,” the force adds. Local television outlet CBS Austin has published a photograph purporting to show the Southwest 737 after the event, with extensive damage to its left-hand CFM International CFM56 engine inlet and nacelle. Austin-Bergstrom airport's operator closed 17R, before stating that the “crime scene has been cleared” and maintenance personnel were preparing to re-open the runway.",5,204,7.0,0.4075,"crew, runway, inquiry, land, approach, accident, investigator, captain, incident, pilot","['circumstance', 'fatal', 'runway', 'incident', 'austinbergstrom', 'airport', 'involve', 'arrive', 'southwest', 'yet', 'become', 'clear', 'airground', 'communication', 'provide', 'little', 'far', 'detail', 'sequence', 'event', 'airport', 'operator', 'described', 'area', 'may', 'incident', 'take', 'place', 'crime', 'scene', 'without', 'elaborate', 'crew', 'inform', 'austin', 'controller', 'approach', 'jedye', 'waypoint', 'ahead', 'il', 'approach', 'runway', 'jet', 'subsequently', 'clear', 'land', 'roll', 'another', 'delta', 'line', 'operating', 'clear', 'land', 'runway', 'tower', 'controller', 'start', 'give', 'taxi', 'instruction', 'southwest', 'crew', 'pilot', 'interrupt', 'state', 'believe', 'might', 'person', 'delta', 'instruct', 'execute', 'miss', 'approach', 'climb', 'controller', 'ask', 'southwest', 'pilot', 'detail', 'exactly', 'see', 'man', 'well', 'behind', 'u', 'pilot', 'reply', 'saw', 'touch', 'controller', 'ask', 'pilot', 'confirm', 'give', 'discretion', 'continue', 'parking', 'stand', 'via', 'g', 'taxiway', 'pilot', 'state', 'hold', 'taxiway', 'g', 'subsequent', 'communication', 'ground', 'personnel', 'refers', 'southwest', 'report', 'suggests', 'crew', 'spot', 'someone', 'foot', 'runway', 'radio', 'transmission', 'archive', 'liveatc', 'southwest', 'say', 'manoeuvre', 'avoid', 'individual', 'appear', 'runway', 'shortly', 'touch', 'around', 'sunset', 'austin', 'none', 'occupant', 'jet', 'injured', 'carrier', 'state', 'fully', 'cooperate', 'local', 'law', 'enforcement', 'u', 'faa', 'incident', 'investigate', 'austintravis', 'county', 'emergency', 'medical', 'service', 'state', 'respond', 'report', 'person', 'possibly', 'struck', 'airplane', 'runway', 'subsequently', 'mention', 'decease', 'scene', 'pronouncement', 'adult', 'patient', 'far', 'information', 'austin', 'police', 'u', 'national', 'transportation', 'safety', 'board', 'delegate', 'investigation', 'confirm', 'male', 'victim', 'authorisation', 'access', 'airfield', 'employee', 'airport', 'possession', 'airport', 'security', 'access', 'badge', 'additional', 'detail', 'identity', 'individual', 'airfield', 'unavailable', 'investigation', 'incident', 'still', 'ongoing', 'force', 'add', 'local', 'television', 'outlet', 'cbs', 'austin', 'publish', 'photograph', 'purport', 'southwest', 'event', 'extensive', 'damage', 'lefthand', 'cfm', 'international', 'engine', 'inlet', 'nacelle', 'austinbergstrom', 'airport', 'operator', 'close', 'state', 'crime', 'scene', 'clear', 'maintenance', 'personnel', 'prepare', 'reopen', 'runway']"
"A man has died in an incident involving a Southwest Airlines aircraft landing at Austin-Bergstrom international airport. The incident occurred around 20:12 local time when the Boeing 737, operating flight 1392, landed at Runway 17R, says the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).  “According to preliminary information, the pilot ...reported seeing a person on Runway 17-Right, shortly after the Boeing 737 touched down,” the FAA adds. Southwest says the aircraft, which was carrying 54 passengers and five crew members, “maneuvered to avoid an individual who became visible on [the runway] shortly after touchdown”. ”The aircraft quickly came to a safe stop, and the pilots reported the event to local air traffic controllers. After receiving further instructions from controllers, the aircraft taxied to a gate where all customers and crew deplaned the aircraft safely with no reports of onboard injuries,” the carrier adds. Emergency services say they responded to the incident at around 20:20, and the man was declared dead at the scene. Airport authorities say the man was an “unauthorised individual”, but no further details about the man's identity have since been released. The FAA has since launched investigations into the incident together with local authorities to determine “whether the aircraft struck the victim”. According to tracking service FlightRadar24, the aircraft in question is a 737-700 bearing the registration N401WN. Cirium fleets data shows Southwest took delivery of the aircraft in 2001.

"Singapore Airlines Groupsaysits financial exposure to Virgin Australia is limited and it is not obliged to inject capital. “On the recent announcement o fVirgin Australia entering into voluntary administration, the SIA Group has no requirement or obligation to provide capital to Virgin Australia,” it said today in a trading update. “We have been equity accounting for our share of losses in Virgin Australia. As at 31 December 2019, our carrying value was zero and we have no exposure to further losses incurred by the company. “We have no outstanding loans to the airline.” Virgin Australia announced on 21 April that it was entering voluntary administration. Administrator Deloitte said on 30 April, after the first creditors meeting, that the airline expects to receive binding offers in June and is confident of achieving a sale by month-end. In its latest fiscal year (FY) 2019 annual report, Virgin Australia lists its top five shareholders as Etihad Airways, followed by Singapore Airlines, China's Nanshan Capital Holdings and HNA Tourism Group, and finally Virgin Group, with a 91.25% stake combined. SIA Group's latest FY 2019 report shows that the carrying amount of its investment in Virgin Australia was S$315 million ($223 million) as at 31 March 2019. This encompassed a S$190 million share of Virgin Australia's net assets.

"The Singapore Airlines Group expects a “material” quarterly operating loss from the “severe impact” of the coronavirus outbreak, as it seeks to readjust aircraft deliveries and defer payments to its suppliers. However, it will still be in the black for the full financial year ended 31 March, thanks to “the benefit of the strong results” for the first nine months. The group will be releasing its full-year results on 14 May. It disclosed in a trading update that the pandemic's impact on air travel has hit its carriers badly and is “exacerbated by the lack of a domestic market for it to fall back upon”. It adds that the collapse of fuel prices in March, coupled with the “unprecedented” capacity cuts, has led to fuel hedging losses and the group's carriers being over-hedged for the new financial year. “Accordingly, the SIA Group expects to report a material operating loss for the final quarter of FY2019/2020. With the benefit of the strong results for the first nine months of the financial year, the SIA Group expects to report a small operating profit, but a net loss, for [the full year],” the group states. SIA and SilkAir have already extended their combined capacity cuts – of around 96% of their network – to the end of June, while low-cost arm Scoot has slashed 98% of its capacity. Meanwhile, the group says that it is negotiating aircraft deliveries, “in view of the prevailing market conditions”. Cirium fleets data indicates SIA has 68 aircraft on order, comprising 19 Airbus A350-900s, 29 Boeing 787-10s and 20 777-9s. SilkAir has 31 737 Max 8s on order, while Scoot has 51 aircraft on order, comprising 46 A320neo family aircraft and five 787s. “We are in negotiations with aircraft manufacturers to adjust our delivery stream for existing aircraft orders, in view of prevailing market conditions, balancing that with our longer-term fleet renewal programme and we are talking with various suppliers to reschedule payments,” the group states without going into further detail. Acknowledging that the post-pandemic recovery timeline remains uncertain, the group adds that it is actively shoring up liquidity, reducing costs and conserving cash. In late March, SIA announced plans to issue S$5.3 billion ($3.75 billion) in equity and S$3.5 billion in 10-year mandatory convertible bonds, in a bid to raise liquidity.

"Leonardo has become the latest major aerospace player to suspend guidance for 2020 as a result of the coronavirus outbreak as its civil business is impacted by a “heavy slowdown” in the commercial market, offset by a “more resilient” demand for its military products. The Italian company – which reported its first quarter results today – is exposed to the airline crisis through its co-ownership with Airbus of regional turboprop manufacturer ATR and an aerostructures arm that is a major supplier to the Boeing 787 programme. A slump in VIP travel is also hitting a helicopter division already affected by the decline in the offshore sector. Aside from its defence electronics and security division, Leonardo manufactures a range of military helicopters and the C-27J military airlifter. The Rome-headquartered group had a “strong start” to 2020, with order intake in the first three months up 36% on the previous year, at €3.4 million, and its “key businesses on track” before the COVID-19 impact in March. Italy was the first European country to be severely affected by the outbreak. A sharp slowdown in production in March caused by a fall in demand and factory closures led to first quarter revenues falling 5% to €2.6 billion and EBITA declining 75% to €41 million. Earlier in the day, Leonardo announced it had secured €2 billion ($2.17 billion) credit facilities with a pool of international banks, which chief executive Alessandro Profumo says will strengthen liquidity and provide “additional financial flexibility in the changed economic environment caused by the pandemic”.",5,208,0.0,0.1865,"order, business, jet, delivery, production, customer, deliver, commercial, quarter, include","['leonardo', 'become', 'late', 'major', 'player', 'suspend', 'guidance', 'result', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'civil', 'business', 'impact', 'heavy', 'slowdown', 'commercial', 'market', 'offset', 'resilient', 'demand', 'military', 'product', 'italian', 'report', 'quarter', 'result', 'today', 'expose', 'crisis', 'coownership', 'regional', 'turboprop', 'manufacturer', 'atr', 'aerostructures', 'arm', 'major', 'supplier', 'programme', 'slump', 'vip', 'travel', 'hit', 'helicopter', 'division', 'already', 'affected', 'decline', 'offshore', 'sector', 'aside', 'defence', 'electronics', 'security', 'division', 'leonardo', 'manufacture', 'range', 'military', 'helicopter', 'military', 'airlifter', 'romeheadquartered', 'strong', 'start', 'order', 'intake', 'month', 'previous', 'key', 'business', 'track', 'coronavirus', 'impact', 'march', 'italy', 'european', 'country', 'severely', 'affected', 'outbreak', 'sharp', 'slowdown', 'production', 'march', 'cause', 'fall', 'demand', 'factory', 'closure', 'lead', 'quarter', 'revenue', 'fall', 'ebita', 'decline', 'earlier', 'day', 'leonardo', 'announce', 'secure', 'credit', 'facility', 'pool', 'international', 'bank', 'chief', 'executive', 'alessandro', 'profumo', 'say', 'strengthen', 'liquidity', 'provide', 'additional', 'financial', 'flexibility', 'change', 'economic', 'environment', 'cause', 'pandemic']"
"Raytheon Technologies is projecting that the US Air Force's (USAF) selection of its Long-Range Standoff Weapon (LRSO) design will be worth about $10 billion to the company over the life of the programme. The company sees the programme as a valuable long-term franchise, it says on an earnings call on 7 May. The USAF gave Raytheon a sole-source contract in April for the LRSO, ending the missile development competition early. Lockheed Martin was also competing to design and build the missile. Each company was awarded $900 million in 2017 for the development effort. The LRSO is a stealthy, nuclear-tipped cruise missile intended to replace the service's AGM-86 Air-Launched Cruise Missile (ALCM). The ALCM is planned to remain in service with the USAF through 2030. The new weapon, which would be launched from a bomber like Boeing's B-52, is one leg in the USA's nuclear triad, a strategy with three options for launching nuclear attacks. Ground launched ballistic missiles and submarine launched ballistic missiles are the other two legs of the triad. Raytheon had anticipated beginning contract negotiations with the USAF for the LRSO's engineering and manufacturing development phase in fiscal year 2021. It expects to sign a contract in FY2022. Winning a large defence programme such as LRSO is welcome news to Raytheon amid coronavirus-caused difficulties within its commercial aviation business. The defence-focused Raytheon Company merged with commercial aviation-focused United Technologies a few weeks earlier, on 3 April. Former United Technologies companies Pratt & Whitney and Collins Aerospace are expected to be especially hard hit. “We expect sales to be down significantly at Pratt and Collins,” says Toby O'Brien, chief financial officer of Raytheon Technologies on the earnings call. “We see [second-quarter] operating profit at Pratt to be a loss and operating profit at Collins to be approximately breakeven.” In the first quarter of 2020, costs related to spinning off elevator company Otis and heating company Carrier helped push Raytheon Technologies to a $83 million loss, down 106% year-on-year. To a lesser extent, costs related to coronavirus safety measures also contributed to the loss in the first quarter. First-quarter sales were down 1% year-on-year to $18.2 billion. Those sales included revenue generated from Otis and Carrier, but not Raytheon Company. The Raytheon Company generated revenue of $7.2 billion in the first quarter, rising year-on-year by 6.5%. It made a profit of $1.19 billion for the period, rising 7.1% year-on-year. Raytheon Technologies holds about $8.5 billion in cash and approximately $25 billion in debt.",5,209,1.0,0.3138,"test, force, helicopter, fire, system, service, attack, design, usaf, missile","['raytheon', 'technology', 'project', 'u', 'force', 'usaf', 'selection', 'longrange', 'standoff', 'weapon', 'lrso', 'design', 'worth', 'life', 'programme', 'see', 'programme', 'valuable', 'longterm', 'franchise', 'say', 'earnings', 'call', 'may', 'usaf', 'give', 'raytheon', 'solesource', 'contract', 'april', 'lrso', 'end', 'missile', 'development', 'competition', 'early', 'lockheed', 'martin', 'compete', 'design', 'build', 'missile', 'award', 'development', 'effort', 'lrso', 'stealthy', 'nucleartipped', 'cruise', 'missile', 'intend', 'replace', 'service', 'airlaunched', 'cruise', 'missile', 'alcm', 'alcm', 'plan', 'remain', 'service', 'usaf', 'weapon', 'launch', 'bomber', 'like', 'leg', 'usa', 'nuclear', 'triad', 'strategy', 'option', 'launch', 'nuclear', 'attack', 'ground', 'launch', 'ballistic', 'missile', 'submarine', 'launch', 'ballistic', 'missile', 'leg', 'triad', 'raytheon', 'anticipate', 'begin', 'contract', 'negotiation', 'usaf', 'lrso', 'engineering', 'manufacturing', 'development', 'phase', 'fiscal', 'expect', 'sign', 'contract', 'win', 'large', 'defence', 'programme', 'lrso', 'welcome', 'news', 'raytheon', 'amid', 'coronaviruscaused', 'difficulty', 'within', 'commercial', 'business', 'defencefocused', 'raytheon', 'merge', 'commercial', 'aviationfocused', 'united', 'technology', 'week', 'earlier', 'april', 'former', 'united', 'technology', 'pratt', 'whitney', 'collins', 'expect', 'especially', 'hard', 'hit', 'expect', 'sale', 'significantly', 'pratt', 'collins', 'say', 'toby', 'chief', 'financial', 'officer', 'raytheon', 'technology', 'earnings', 'call', 'see', 'secondquarter', 'operating', 'profit', 'pratt', 'loss', 'operating', 'profit', 'collins', 'approximately', 'quarter', 'cost', 'related', 'spin', 'elevator', 'otis', 'heating', 'carrier', 'help', 'push', 'raytheon', 'technology', 'loss', 'yearonyear', 'lesser', 'extent', 'cost', 'related', 'coronavirus', 'safety', 'measure', 'contribute', 'loss', 'quarter', 'firstquarter', 'sale', 'yearonyear', 'sale', 'include', 'revenue', 'generate', 'otis', 'carrier', 'raytheon', 'raytheon', 'generate', 'revenue', 'quarter', 'rise', 'yearonyear', 'make', 'profit', 'period', 'rise', 'yearonyear', 'raytheon', 'technology', 'hold', 'cash', 'approximately', 'debt']"
"The coronavirus pandemic has eroded demand for business jets, accelerated Bombardier's cash burn and will lead the company to slow aircraft production. But Bombardier's chief executive floats the idea that the coronavirus could ultimately boost business jet sales, as contagion-wary customers seek alternatives to commercial airlines. “Will this pandemic create more interest in people...flying business jets?” says CEO Eric Martel on 7 May. “Will people decide to adopt this way of travel?” Martel believes the answer could be yes. But in the near term, Bombardier, like other aerospace manufacturers, is reeling from the pandemic's fallout. Bombardier Aviation's first-quarter profit, excluding finance expenses, declined 99% year-on-year to $7 million, it reports. When accounting for taxes and finance costs, the broader company (including all business units) lost $200 million in the period. “Since the onset of the pandemic and travel restriction, sales activity has slowed down significantly,” Martel says during the company's first-quarter earnings call. “We have seen limited cancellations in our backlog.” Bombardier reports a $400-500 million cash flow shortfall in the quarter due to coronavirus-related factors such as sagging demand, travel restrictions, facility closures and inability to deliver aircraft. Chief financial officer John di Bert says “more than a handful of aircraft could not be delivered” in the period. Bombardier says it will “align” aircraft production rates with the expectation that demand for new business aircraft will decline 30-35%. The company has not issued 2020 delivery guidance, but it delivered 142 business aircraft and 33 commercial aircraft in 2019. Martel says Bombardier saw “lower-than-expected” aircraft orders in the first quarter. The large-jet segment, in which Bombardier's flagship line of Global business jets reside, “is better protected” from the downturn than the small- and mid-size jet sectors, which are “a bit more volatile right now”, Martel adds. In addition to Globals, Bombardier Aviation manufacturers midsize Challengers and Learjet 75s, a light jet. It also makes CRJ regional jets, though it intends to sell that programme's aftermarket support business to Mitsubishi Heavy Industries on 1 June. The company had expected to end production of the CRJ in the second half of 2020. Bombardier closed facilities on 24 March to meet strict local government guidelines, but is now “gradually resuming manufacturing activities,” and reopening all shuttered facilities, Martel says. He describes this task as “a tremendous undertaking” involving implementation of “new stringent health and safety procedures”, recalling thousands of furloughed employees, restoring “disruptive” supply chains and “resetting” delivery schedules with customers. “We expect this process will take the remainder of the second quarter [to complete], and it is likely to generate some challenges along the way,” says Martel. He expects the second quarter to be a “low point” in 2020 – with shipments set to fall by half year-on-year – as manufacturing and travel curbs continue to pummel deliveries and sales. Bombardier expects to see a “gradual recovery” in the second-half of the year. Despite market conditions, the company will “ramp up” 7500 production after mid-year, but will deliver “a few less” of those jets this year than previously anticipated. Most recently Bombardier had said it would deliver 35-40 7500s in 2020. The airframer generated $1.5 billion in first-quarter revenue, up 8% year-on-year. Martel says business jet deliveries were progressing well until the onset of coronavirus. Bombardier delivered 26 business aircraft in the period (including six Globals), two more business jets than in the same quarter of 2019. Bombardier handed over five CRJ regional jets in the first quarter, up from four one year earlier. Bombardier's first-quarter cash flow was negative $1.6 billion, and the company ended March with cash, cash equivalents and available credit of $2.9 billion. It expects to bolster reserves by $550 million with the CRJ sale and by $500 million with the sale of its aerostructures business to Spirit AeroSystems. That deal will close in the “coming months”, Bombardier says. “Collectively, when completed these transactions will improve our cash position by over $1 billion dollars, and will also mark the completion of Bombardier's exit from the commercial aerospace market,” says Martel. Bombardier is also “making progress” with French industrial giant Alstom to complete the sale of its rail division, and Martel says the company “does not expect any delay to the original timeline”. Once the sale is complete, Bombardier will become a stand-alone business aircraft manufacturer. “While this is an extremely challenging environment, I am optimistic about our future,” Martel says. The value of Bombardier's business jet backlog stood at $13.6 billion on 31 March, down from $14.4 billion at the end of the fourth quarter.",5,210,0.0,0.5305,"order, business, jet, delivery, production, customer, deliver, commercial, quarter, include","['coronavirus', 'pandemic', 'erode', 'demand', 'business', 'jet', 'accelerate', 'bombardier', 'cash', 'burn', 'lead', 'slow', 'production', 'bombardier', 'chief', 'executive', 'float', 'idea', 'coronavirus', 'ultimately', 'boost', 'business', 'jet', 'sale', 'contagionwary', 'customer', 'seek', 'alternative', 'commercial', 'pandemic', 'create', 'interest', 'people', 'fly', 'business', 'jet', 'say', 'ceo', 'eric', 'martel', 'may', 'people', 'decide', 'adopt', 'way', 'travel', 'martel', 'believe', 'answer', 'yes', 'near', 'term', 'bombardier', 'like', 'manufacturer', 'reel', 'pandemic', 'fallout', 'bombardier', 'firstquarter', 'profit', 'exclude', 'finance', 'expense', 'decline', 'yearonyear', 'report', 'accounting', 'tax', 'finance', 'cost', 'broader', 'include', 'business', 'unit', 'lose', 'period', 'since', 'onset', 'pandemic', 'travel', 'restriction', 'sale', 'activity', 'slow', 'significantly', 'martel', 'say', 'firstquarter', 'earnings', 'call', 'see', 'limited', 'cancellation', 'bombardier', 'report', 'cash', 'flow', 'shortfall', 'quarter', 'due', 'coronavirusrelated', 'factor', 'sag', 'demand', 'travel', 'restriction', 'facility', 'closure', 'inability', 'deliver', 'chief', 'financial', 'officer', 'john', 'di', 'bert', 'say', 'handful', 'deliver', 'period', 'bombardier', 'say', 'align', 'production', 'rate', 'expectation', 'demand', 'business', 'decline', 'issue', 'delivery', 'guidance', 'deliver', 'business', 'commercial', 'martel', 'say', 'bombardier', 'saw', 'lowerthanexpected', 'order', 'quarter', 'largejet', 'segment', 'bombardier', 'flagship', 'line', 'global', 'business', 'jet', 'reside', 'well', 'protect', 'downturn', 'small', 'midsize', 'jet', 'sector', 'bit', 'volatile', 'right', 'martel', 'add', 'addition', 'globals', 'bombardier', 'manufacturer', 'midsize', 'challenger', 'learjet', 'light', 'jet', 'make', 'crj', 'regional', 'jet', 'though', 'intend', 'sell', 'programme', 'aftermarket', 'support', 'business', 'mitsubishi', 'heavy', 'industry', 'june', 'expect', 'end', 'production', 'crj', 'second', 'half', 'bombardier', 'close', 'facility', 'march', 'meet', 'strict', 'local', 'government', 'guideline', 'gradually', 'resume', 'manufacturing', 'activity', 'reopen', 'shutter', 'facility', 'martel', 'say', 'describes', 'task', 'tremendous', 'undertaking', 'involve', 'implementation', 'stringent', 'health', 'safety', 'procedure', 'recall', 'thousand', 'furlough', 'employee', 'restore', 'disruptive', 'supply', 'chain', 'reset', 'delivery', 'schedule', 'customer', 'expect', 'process', 'take', 'remainder', 'second', 'quarter', 'complete', 'likely', 'generate', 'challenge', 'along', 'way', 'say', 'martel', 'expect', 'second', 'quarter', 'low', 'point', 'shipment', 'set', 'fall', 'half', 'yearonyear', 'manufacturing', 'travel', 'curb', 'continue', 'pummel', 'delivery', 'sale', 'bombardier', 'expect', 'see', 'gradual', 'recovery', 'secondhalf', 'despite', 'market', 'condition', 'ramp', 'production', 'midyear', 'deliver', 'less', 'jet', 'previously', 'anticipate', 'recently', 'bombardier', 'say', 'deliver', 'airframer', 'generate', 'firstquarter', 'revenue', 'yearonyear', 'martel', 'say', 'business', 'jet', 'delivery', 'progress', 'well', 'onset', 'coronavirus', 'bombardier', 'deliver', 'business', 'period', 'include', 'globals', 'business', 'jet', 'quarter', 'bombardier', 'hand', 'crj', 'regional', 'jet', 'quarter', 'earlier', 'bombardier', 'firstquarter', 'cash', 'flow', 'negative', 'end', 'march', 'cash', 'cash', 'equivalent', 'available', 'credit', 'expect', 'bolster', 'reserve', 'crj', 'sale', 'sale', 'aerostructures', 'business', 'spirit', 'aerosystems', 'deal', 'close', 'come', 'month', 'bombardier', 'say', 'collectively', 'complete', 'transaction', 'improve', 'cash', 'position', 'dollar', 'mark', 'completion', 'bombardier', 'exit', 'commercial', 'market', 'say', 'martel', 'bombardier', 'make', 'progress', 'french', 'industrial', 'giant', 'alstom', 'complete', 'sale', 'rail', 'division', 'martel', 'say', 'expect', 'delay', 'original', 'timeline', 'sale', 'complete', 'bombardier', 'become', 'standalone', 'business', 'manufacturer', 'extremely', 'challenge', 'environment', 'optimistic', 'future', 'martel', 'say', 'value', 'bombardier', 'business', 'jet', 'backlog', 'stood', 'march', 'end', 'fourth', 'quarter']"
"Offshore helicopter operators will be waiting nervously for the outcome of investigations into the crash of a military helicopter off the coast of Greece in which six Canadian personnel were killed. The Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) Sikorsky CH-148 Cyclone anti-submarine warfare helicopter came down in good weather in the Mediterranean Sea on 29 April where it was operating as part of a NATO mission, killing all six on board. Both the cockpit- and flight-data recorders have been recovered, but no details of the accident have been released. Although the RCAF has “paused” operations with the type, this is a typical response under the circumstances. However, commercial operators will be watching the situation with trepidation as the CH-148 is a military derivative of Sikorsky's S-92 – a mainstay of the offshore transportation segment. While there is no suggestion at this stage of a safety issue with the Cyclone, if the accident is traced back to a mechanical failure which requires the S-92 to be grounded for any length of time there are precious few alternatives for long-range crew-change missions. If that were to persist, then offshore operators would be left scrabbling for capacity, believes Steve Robertson, director of boutique research firm Air & Sea Analytics. “Is there a like-for-like alternative? No there's not,” he says. “The industry would have to find a way of coping somehow, but it would be pretty difficult in places like Norway and the UK which are reliant on this aircraft.” According to Air & Sea's analysis, there were 164 S-92s working in the oil and gas sector at the turn of the year, with over 70 present in the North Sea region alone. Although super-medium-class types such as the Airbus Helicopters H175 and Leonardo Helicopters AW189 – both are 16-passenger aircraft – have a growing presence in the oil and gas sector, building on the existing fleet of AW139s, there are unlikely to be sufficient aircraft to backfill for an absent S-92, says Robertson. “There is not enough spare capacity sitting around to take up that slack,” he says. “Each company will have their own contingency plans, but there is no 'business as usual' scenario.” And while offshore activity may have dipped on the back of lower oil prices, coronavirus social-distancing rules mean that fewer passengers can be carried on each helicopter, creating a broadly unchanged short-term flight requirement in the North Sea. But globally, activity levels are down by over 25% year on year, according to Air & Sea data. Sara Dhariwal, valuations analyst at consultancy Ascend by Cirium, says that the global fleet of offshore-roled helicopters totals around 1,820 aircraft, of which 210 are S-92s. Storage numbers are “climbing on a daily basis” on the back of the oil price crash. While some of these rotorcraft could be pressed back into service if required, “it would be a challenge to replace the capacity of a fleet of close to 250 heavy helicopters,” she says. Oil and gas helicopter operators have been solely reliant on the S-92 for long-range or 19-passenger missions since the effective retirement of the rival H225 from the majority of offshore missions after a gearbox-related safety nightmare (ironically beginning on 29 April 2016). There have been recent scares with the heavy-twin, including a tail rotor issue in late 2016, but no serious safety failings since a fatal crash in 2009 off Newfoundland.",5,211,1.0,0.2747,"test, force, helicopter, fire, system, service, attack, design, usaf, missile","['offshore', 'helicopter', 'operator', 'wait', 'nervously', 'outcome', 'investigation', 'crash', 'military', 'helicopter', 'coast', 'greece', 'canadian', 'personnel', 'kill', 'royal', 'canadian', 'force', 'rcaf', 'sikorsky', 'cyclone', 'antisubmarine', 'warfare', 'helicopter', 'come', 'good', 'weather', 'mediterranean', 'sea', 'april', 'operating', 'part', 'nato', 'mission', 'kill', 'board', 'cockpit', 'flightdata', 'recorder', 'recover', 'detail', 'accident', 'release', 'although', 'rcaf', 'pause', 'operation', 'type', 'typical', 'response', 'circumstance', 'however', 'commercial', 'operator', 'watch', 'situation', 'trepidation', 'military', 'derivative', 'sikorsky', 'mainstay', 'offshore', 'transportation', 'segment', 'suggestion', 'stage', 'safety', 'issue', 'cyclone', 'accident', 'trace', 'back', 'mechanical', 'failure', 'require', 'ground', 'length', 'precious', 'alternative', 'longrange', 'crewchange', 'mission', 'persist', 'offshore', 'operator', 'left', 'scrabble', 'capacity', 'believe', 'steve', 'robertson', 'director', 'boutique', 'research', 'firm', 'sea', 'analytics', 'likeforlike', 'alternative', 'say', 'industry', 'find', 'way', 'cop', 'somehow', 'pretty', 'difficult', 'place', 'like', 'norway', 'uk', 'reliant', 'accord', 'sea', 'analysis', 'work', 'oil', 'gas', 'sector', 'turn', 'present', 'north', 'sea', 'region', 'alone', 'although', 'supermediumclass', 'type', 'helicopter', 'leonardo', 'helicopter', 'grow', 'presence', 'oil', 'gas', 'sector', 'building', 'exist', 'fleet', 'unlikely', 'sufficient', 'backfill', 'absent', 'say', 'robertson', 'enough', 'spare', 'capacity', 'sit', 'around', 'take', 'slack', 'say', 'contingency', 'plan', 'usual', 'offshore', 'activity', 'may', 'dipped', 'back', 'low', 'oil', 'price', 'coronavirus', 'socialdistancing', 'rule', 'mean', 'passenger', 'carry', 'helicopter', 'create', 'broadly', 'unchanged', 'shortterm', 'requirement', 'north', 'sea', 'globally', 'activity', 'level', 'accord', 'sea', 'data', 'sara', 'dhariwal', 'valuation', 'analyst', 'consultancy', 'ascend', 'say', 'global', 'fleet', 'offshoreroled', 'helicopter', 'total', 'around', 'storage', 'number', 'climb', 'daily', 'basis', 'back', 'oil', 'price', 'crash', 'rotorcraft', 'press', 'back', 'service', 'require', 'challenge', 'replace', 'capacity', 'fleet', 'close', 'heavy', 'helicopter', 'say', 'oil', 'gas', 'helicopter', 'operator', 'solely', 'reliant', 'longrange', 'mission', 'since', 'effective', 'retirement', 'rival', 'majority', 'offshore', 'mission', 'gearboxrelated', 'safety', 'nightmare', 'ironically', 'begin', 'april', 'recent', 'scare', 'heavytwin', 'include', 'tail', 'rotor', 'issue', 'late', 'serious', 'safety', 'failing', 'since', 'fatal', 'crash', 'newfoundland']"
"South African investigators have stated that Johannesburg airport ground control should have instructed pilots of a Mango Boeing 737-800 to deviate from a taxiway, rather than give them the option, before the aircraft struck a taxiing Comair jet. But the inquiry into the incident, on 19 April last year, makes no reference to the decision by the Comair 737-800 pilots to proceed with a departure to Durban despite uncertainty from both crews over the possibility of contact. The South African Civil Aviation Authority had already detailed the geometry of the event, which occurred as both aircraft were taxiing for departure. Investigators state that the Mango 737 was following the Comair jet along taxiway A. When the Comair aircraft turned right onto link N, its tail remained protruding on taxiway A, leaving some 29m clearance. Boeing documentation on winglet-fitted 737-800s indicates the Mango aircraft would have needed at least 21m to pass without its left-hand main landing-gear leaving the shoulder of the taxiway. While ground control gave the Mango crew an alternative route to pass safely – by steering onto a parallel taxiway – it said the crew could use this option “if required”. The inquiry says the reason for this decision “is not clear”, adding: “The [controller] should have issued [the Mango crew] with an instruction and not give them an option. “It is also likely that [the controller] knew or suspected that the [Mango 737] would not safely maneouvre behind [the Comair 737].” After its crew opted against the deviation the Mango aircraft's right winglet struck the Comair aircraft's left-hand horizontal stabiliser. Radio communications show that the Comair crew had felt the impact as “a bit of a bang” and asked tower controllers whether there had been a collision. This query was relayed to the Mango crew, who initially replied that they had not felt anything – leaving the Comair crew satisfied that they could depart safely. But the Mango pilots, about 1min before the Comair flight was cleared for take-off, expressed doubt over their own conviction and decided to return to the parking area for a walk-round check, during which the winglet damage was discovered. The inquiry has not made any specific reference to the potential risk arising from undetected damage to the Comair 737, whose crew was only informed of the Mango precaution during approach to Durban. Engineers subsequently found the horizontal stabiliser to be damaged along with a static wick on the elevator. Investigators have attributed the collision to “poor airmanship” and “poor situational awareness” by the Mango crew.

"IAG chief executive Willie Walsh believes its planned acquisition of Spanish carrier Air Europa still makes strategic sense but notes work is still ongoing regarding pricing and competition issues before a decision on completion can be made. The Iberia and Vueling parent in early November outlined its plan to acquire Air Europa for €1 billion ($1.1 billion), in a deal it expected to close in the first half of this year. The move was driven by a desire to strengthen Iberia's presence at Madrid, while also helping to offset the loss of long-term partner LATAM Airlines in the Europe-Latin America market. But completion of the deal has been complicated by the coronavirus crisis and IAG has reportedly been in talks to renegotiate the price of the acquisition. “The deal makes strategic sense to us,” said Walsh, speaking during a first quarter results briefing today in which he confirmed there is a price-adjustment mechanism in the agreement. “However we do need to understand whether the price adjustment mechanism that is in the agreement is relevant and we have to go through the competition process still, so there is quite a bit to do in relation to Air Europa and we will keep that under review,” Walsh says. In March, IAG struck a provisional agreement with Volotea aimed at allaying competition concerns under which the Barcelona-headquartered airline would open up to four bases in Spain in order to pick up routes through slots transferred from either Iberia or Air Europa. “We know that they are challenged, even more so than we are, and have been taking action to survive the crisis,” Walsh says of Air Europa. “I am not sure they are taking in any revenues and I don't have visibility on the actions they have taken to reduce their cash outflow. That is something that we will see but I don't have visibility on that at this stage.”",5,213,8.0,0.3158,"government, uk, carrier, business, state, share, south, airway, financial, plan","['iag', 'chief', 'executive', 'willie', 'walsh', 'believe', 'plan', 'acquisition', 'spanish', 'carrier', 'europa', 'still', 'make', 'strategic', 'sense', 'note', 'work', 'still', 'ongoing', 'regard', 'pricing', 'competition', 'issue', 'decision', 'completion', 'make', 'iberia', 'vueling', 'parent', 'early', 'november', 'outline', 'plan', 'acquire', 'europa', 'deal', 'expect', 'close', 'half', 'move', 'driven', 'desire', 'strengthen', 'iberia', 'presence', 'madrid', 'help', 'offset', 'loss', 'longterm', 'partner', 'latam', 'europelatin', 'america', 'market', 'completion', 'deal', 'complicate', 'coronavirus', 'crisis', 'iag', 'reportedly', 'talk', 'renegotiate', 'price', 'acquisition', 'deal', 'make', 'strategic', 'sense', 'u', 'say', 'walsh', 'speak', 'quarter', 'result', 'briefing', 'today', 'confirm', 'priceadjustment', 'mechanism', 'agreement', 'however', 'need', 'understand', 'whether', 'price', 'adjustment', 'mechanism', 'agreement', 'relevant', 'go', 'competition', 'process', 'still', 'quite', 'bit', 'relation', 'europa', 'keep', 'review', 'walsh', 'say', 'march', 'iag', 'struck', 'provisional', 'agreement', 'volotea', 'aim', 'allay', 'competition', 'concern', 'barcelonaheadquartered', 'open', 'base', 'spain', 'order', 'pick', 'route', 'slot', 'transfer', 'either', 'iberia', 'europa', 'know', 'challenged', 'even', 'take', 'action', 'survive', 'crisis', 'walsh', 'say', 'europa', 'sure', 'take', 'revenue', 'visibility', 'action', 'take', 'reduce', 'cash', 'outflow', 'something', 'see', 'visibility', 'stage']"
"The executive charter market will see a spike in demand once coronavirus lockdown restrictions are lifted because many business travelers, nervous about using airlines and busy airports, will opt to fly privately. However, despite a flurry of Caribbean trips and around the start of Europe's ski season this autumn, the high-end leisure market will remain sluggish until a Covid-19 vaccine is widely available, predicts the head of one of the UK's largest aircraft management companies. Patrick Margetson-Rushmore, chief executive of Luxaviation UK has also provided an insight into how the firm – which has 15 managed aircraft available for charter on the UK register – has been impacted by the outbreak and its plans to return to full operation. After the UK lockdown was imposed on 23 March, he says demand “disappeared overnight”. From operating around nine flights a day, Luxaviation UK – which is part of the Luxembourg-based Luxaviation Group that also owns ExecuJet – has flown just eight revenue services in six weeks. Most of these have been repatriation flights. As part of its safety procedures, passengers are required to wear masks and gloves. No food or drink is served and, on larger aircraft, the cabin attendant remains in the galley area. Cabins are “deep sanitized” before and after each flight, he says. Luxaviation UK has furloughed 70 of its staff under the government's job-retention scheme, but retained 16 pilots and attendants – one crew for each of its seven types – alongside a skeleton backroom team. Rather than mothballing aircraft, it has kept its aircraft on stand-by by doing regular taxi runs, and brought forward some maintenance, says Margetson-Rushmore. Keeping aircraft and crews flight-ready is costly, he admits, but will make it easier for the fleet to return to service.",5,214,12.0,0.1772,"travel, government, country, coronavirus, measure, restriction, passenger, state, march, canada","['executive', 'charter', 'market', 'see', 'spike', 'demand', 'coronavirus', 'lockdown', 'restriction', 'lift', 'many', 'business', 'traveler', 'nervous', 'use', 'busy', 'airport', 'opt', 'fly', 'privately', 'however', 'despite', 'flurry', 'caribbean', 'trip', 'around', 'start', 'europe', 'ski', 'season', 'autumn', 'highend', 'leisure', 'market', 'remain', 'sluggish', 'coronavirus', 'vaccine', 'widely', 'available', 'predicts', 'head', 'uk', 'large', 'management', 'patrick', 'margetsonrushmore', 'chief', 'executive', 'luxaviation', 'uk', 'provide', 'insight', 'firm', 'manage', 'available', 'charter', 'uk', 'register', 'impact', 'outbreak', 'plan', 'return', 'full', 'operation', 'uk', 'lockdown', 'impose', 'march', 'say', 'demand', 'disappear', 'overnight', 'operating', 'around', 'day', 'luxaviation', 'uk', 'part', 'luxembourgbased', 'luxaviation', 'execujet', 'flown', 'revenue', 'service', 'week', 'repatriation', 'part', 'safety', 'procedure', 'passenger', 'require', 'wear', 'mask', 'glove', 'food', 'drink', 'serve', 'large', 'cabin', 'attendant', 'remains', 'galley', 'area', 'cabin', 'deep', 'sanitize', 'say', 'luxaviation', 'uk', 'furlough', 'staff', 'government', 'jobretention', 'scheme', 'retain', 'pilot', 'attendant', 'crew', 'type', 'alongside', 'skeleton', 'backroom', 'team', 'rather', 'mothball', 'kept', 'standby', 'regular', 'taxi', 'run', 'brought', 'forward', 'maintenance', 'say', 'margetsonrushmore', 'keep', 'crew', 'flightready', 'costly', 'admits', 'make', 'easy', 'fleet', 'return', 'service']"
"Manufacturing and international travel restrictions imposed by the coronavirus pandemic resulted in a 50% slide in deliveries of Daher's TBM single-engined turboprop series in the first quarter, but the French airframer says there is “no shortage of interest” in the high-speed aircraft. For the three months ended 31 March, Tarbes-headquartered Daher shipped four top-of-the-range TBM 940s and no baseline 910s. This compares with seven 910s in the first quarter of 2019 and one 930, the previous iteration of the 940. Daher's latest flagship entered service in June 2019, introducing to the platform an autothrottle and increased automation for the de-icing system. The current version of the aircraft, which arrived in March, features a host of cabin enhancements and Garmin's autoland safety system. Daher says this functionality, which it brands as HomeSafe, can control and land the aircraft without human intervention in the event of pilot incapacitation. The system will be activated when it receives simultaneous European and US approvals, pegged for late June. Nicolas Chabbert, senior vice-president for Daher's airplane business, says introduction of HomeSafe has boosted interest in the TBM 940, while demand in the 910 – which does not have the feature - is steady. “There has been no drop in interest for our products, nor any pressure on pricing so far,” he notes. The company had planned to deliver 50 aircraft in 2020 - two more than last year - but Chabbert expects output for the year could be more than 20% down. “While our production line [in Tarbes] is gradually getting back to normal levels, we have lost so much time because of the manufacturing restrictions [surrounding social distancing]. We are never going to make that up,” says Chabbert. He also anticipates “supply chain issues” later in the year, but does not elaborate. Travel restrictions imposed by the pandemic also curtailed customer deliveries in the first quarter, Daher says, without specifying the number of units involved. Meanwhile, shipments of Kodiak 100 single-engined turboprops dipped by only one unit in the first quarter to six, and Daher plans to deliver 15 of the utility type in 2020 – five fewer than last year. The Sandpoint, Idaho-based airframer was acquired by Daher in June 2019 and has now been fully integrated, says Chabbert.",5,215,0.0,0.3342,"order, business, jet, delivery, production, customer, deliver, commercial, quarter, include","['manufacturing', 'international', 'travel', 'restriction', 'impose', 'coronavirus', 'pandemic', 'result', 'slide', 'delivery', 'daher', 'tbm', 'singleengined', 'turboprop', 'series', 'quarter', 'french', 'airframer', 'say', 'shortage', 'interest', 'highspeed', 'month', 'end', 'march', 'tarbesheadquartered', 'daher', 'ship', 'topoftherange', 'tbm', 'baseline', 'compare', 'quarter', 'previous', 'iteration', 'daher', 'late', 'flagship', 'enter', 'service', 'june', 'introduce', 'platform', 'autothrottle', 'increase', 'automation', 'deice', 'system', 'current', 'version', 'arrive', 'march', 'feature', 'host', 'cabin', 'enhancement', 'garmin', 'autoland', 'safety', 'system', 'daher', 'say', 'functionality', 'brand', 'homesafe', 'control', 'land', 'without', 'human', 'intervention', 'event', 'pilot', 'incapacitation', 'system', 'activate', 'receives', 'simultaneous', 'european', 'u', 'approval', 'pegged', 'late', 'june', 'nicolas', 'chabbert', 'senior', 'vicepresident', 'daher', 'airplane', 'business', 'say', 'introduction', 'homesafe', 'boost', 'interest', 'tbm', 'demand', 'feature', 'steady', 'drop', 'interest', 'product', 'pressure', 'pricing', 'far', 'note', 'plan', 'deliver', 'chabbert', 'expect', 'output', 'production', 'line', 'tarbes', 'gradually', 'get', 'back', 'normal', 'level', 'lose', 'much', 'manufacturing', 'restriction', 'surround', 'social', 'distance', 'never', 'go', 'make', 'say', 'chabbert', 'anticipates', 'supply', 'chain', 'issue', 'later', 'elaborate', 'travel', 'restriction', 'impose', 'pandemic', 'curtail', 'customer', 'delivery', 'quarter', 'daher', 'say', 'without', 'specify', 'number', 'unit', 'involve', 'meanwhile', 'shipment', 'kodiak', 'singleengined', 'turboprop', 'dipped', 'unit', 'quarter', 'daher', 'plan', 'deliver', 'utility', 'type', 'sandpoint', 'idahobased', 'airframer', 'acquire', 'daher', 'june', 'fully', 'integrate', 'say', 'chabbert']"
"Spirit AeroSystems posted a $163 million first-quarter loss and warned of an uncertain future as the impact of the coronavirus pandemic and ongoing Boeing 737 Max grounding hit hard. The first-quarter loss compares to a profit of $163 million in the same period last year. Citing “uncertain” market conditions, Spirit also warns that changes to 787 and Airbus A350 production rates could add $100 million in forward losses to its second quarter results.  Spirit AeroSystems makes 737 Max fuselages, as seen above. The 737 programme generated roughly half of Spirit's revenue prior to the type's grounding in March 2019. Spirit also says it reached a revised agreement with Boeing to deliver only 125 737 Max fuselages in 2020. That figure is down 40% from a previous plan to deliver 216 Max fuselages this year. Spirit's first-quarter revenue plummeted 45% year on year, to $1.1 billion, “primarily due” to Boeing's suspension of 737 Max production in January, a result of the Max grounding. “The aerospace industry and Spirit are facing unprecedented disruption and uncertainty from the continued 737 Max grounding and Covid-19 pandemic,” Spirt says. The company has “executed a number of cost reduction activities to align our cost structure to the lowered rates of production. In addition, we have taken several actions to preserve liquidity.” Spirit in the last week announced it is cutting another 1,450 jobs in Wichita, 14% of its workforce there. Those cuts add to 3,200 jobs (including 2,800 in Wichita and 400 in Oklahoma) that Spirit eliminated earlier this year. The company also cut 200 contractor positions, reduced executive pay 20%, implemented four-day work weeks for salaried staff and furloughed Boeing programme workers in Wichita and Oklahoma for 21 days. During the first quarter, Spirit delivered 324 aerostructures sets, down 28% from 453 sets one year earlier. Spirit handed over just 18 737 Max sets in the first quarter. That compares to 152 sets for the same period a year earlier. Prior to the Max grounding, 737 fuselages accounted for roughly half of Spirit's revenue. In addition to revising its 2020 737 Max fuselage delivery forecast to 125 units, Spirit in the first quarter received $225 million in advance payments from Boeing. It also deferred $120 million in planned capital expenses and issued $1.2 billion in debt. Spirit's first quarter results reflect $73 million in Max-related “excess capacity costs”, restructuring expenses of $43 million, “abnormal” coronavirus-related costs of $25 million and $69 million from a voluntary retirement programme. Additionally, Spirit logged $20 million in forward losses attributed to the 747, 787, A350 and Rolls-Royce BR725 engine programmes. Spirit burned $331 million in cash during the first quarter and ended the period with cash and cash equivalents valued at $1.7 billion. The company's fuselage business lost $86 million in the first quarter; its propulsion business lost $5.3 million, but its wing business posted a $13.6 million profit. Spirit has suspended financial guidance but warns its second quarter results could be hammered by $70-90 million in forward losses attributed to the 787 programme and $15-20 million in losses from the A350 programme. Citing broad market “uncertainty”, Spirit warns those figures could change significantly. Boeing recently disclosed plans to cut 787 production from 14 to 10 aircraft monthly this year and to seven jets monthly by 2022. Airbus has also planned A350 production cuts.",5,216,0.0,0.4275,"order, business, jet, delivery, production, customer, deliver, commercial, quarter, include","['spirit', 'aerosystems', 'post', 'firstquarter', 'loss', 'warn', 'uncertain', 'future', 'impact', 'coronavirus', 'pandemic', 'ongoing', 'ground', 'hit', 'hard', 'firstquarter', 'loss', 'compare', 'profit', 'period', 'cite', 'uncertain', 'market', 'condition', 'spirit', 'warns', 'change', 'production', 'rate', 'add', 'forward', 'loss', 'second', 'quarter', 'result', 'spirit', 'aerosystems', 'make', 'fuselage', 'see', 'programme', 'generate', 'roughly', 'half', 'spirit', 'revenue', 'prior', 'type', 'ground', 'march', 'spirit', 'say', 'reach', 'revise', 'agreement', 'deliver', 'fuselage', 'figure', 'previous', 'plan', 'deliver', 'fuselage', 'spirit', 'firstquarter', 'revenue', 'plummet', 'primarily', 'due', 'suspension', 'production', 'january', 'result', 'ground', 'industry', 'spirit', 'face', 'unprecedented', 'disruption', 'uncertainty', 'continued', 'ground', 'coronavirus', 'pandemic', 'spirt', 'say', 'execute', 'number', 'cost', 'reduction', 'activity', 'align', 'cost', 'structure', 'lower', 'rate', 'production', 'addition', 'take', 'several', 'action', 'preserve', 'spirit', 'week', 'announce', 'cut', 'another', 'job', 'wichita', 'workforce', 'cut', 'add', 'job', 'include', 'wichita', 'oklahoma', 'spirit', 'eliminate', 'earlier', 'cut', 'contractor', 'position', 'reduce', 'executive', 'pay', 'implement', 'fourday', 'work', 'week', 'salaried', 'staff', 'furlough', 'programme', 'worker', 'wichita', 'oklahoma', 'day', 'quarter', 'spirit', 'deliver', 'aerostructures', 'set', 'set', 'earlier', 'spirit', 'hand', 'set', 'quarter', 'compare', 'set', 'period', 'earlier', 'prior', 'ground', 'fuselage', 'account', 'roughly', 'half', 'spirit', 'revenue', 'addition', 'revise', 'fuselage', 'delivery', 'forecast', 'unit', 'spirit', 'quarter', 'receive', 'advance', 'payment', 'defer', 'plan', 'capital', 'expense', 'issue', 'debt', 'spirit', 'quarter', 'result', 'reflect', 'maxrelated', 'excess', 'capacity', 'cost', 'restructuring', 'expense', 'abnormal', 'coronavirusrelated', 'cost', 'voluntary', 'retirement', 'programme', 'additionally', 'spirit', 'log', 'forward', 'loss', 'attribute', 'rollsroyce', 'engine', 'programme', 'spirit', 'burn', 'cash', 'quarter', 'end', 'period', 'cash', 'cash', 'equivalent', 'value', 'fuselage', 'business', 'lose', 'quarter', 'propulsion', 'business', 'lose', 'wing', 'business', 'post', 'profit', 'spirit', 'suspend', 'financial', 'guidance', 'warns', 'second', 'quarter', 'result', 'hammer', 'forward', 'loss', 'attribute', 'programme', 'loss', 'programme', 'cite', 'broad', 'market', 'uncertainty', 'spirit', 'warns', 'figure', 'change', 'significantly', 'recently', 'disclose', 'plan', 'cut', 'production', 'monthly', 'jet', 'monthly', 'plan', 'production', 'cut']"
"Qatar Airways is to axe a “substantial number” of jobs as the global aviation industry faces a “grim” global outlook with no foreseeable improvement, the airline's chief executive has told employees. In a 4 May letter to cabin crew, Akbar Al Baker writes: “The truth is, we simply cannot sustain the current staff numbers and will need to make a substantial number of jobs redundant – inclusive of cabin crew.” Details of the planned reductions will be communicated “in the upcoming weeks”, says Al Baker in the letter, and the airline is developing a “special recruitment programme” to ensure that staff can make a “swift return” to the airline “should the opportunity arise”. The airline has declined to comment further on how many jobs will be affected, but says it must “act decisively” to protect its future. ”Qatar Airways can confirm that the airline will make a number of roles redundant due to the impact of Covid-19,” it states. “Any job loss is regrettable and we will be working closely with all affected employees to offer our full support during this difficult time.” Al Baker adds: “Despite all our efforts and hopes for a quick rebound, we are facing adversity on an unprecedented scale. The global outlook for our industry looks grim and many airlines are closing or significantly reducing operations. Qatar Airways is not immune to this challenge.” The Doha-based Oneworld member must face “a new reality” in which many international borders are closed, “with no foreseeable outlook for immediate, positive change”, says Al Baker. Qatar Airways had shown more resistance than other airlines to cutting services, noting in early April that it was “working with governments around the world to maintain a strong schedule of flights, and organising charter flights where needed”.",5,217,2.0,0.3091,"executive, chief, cut, add, situation, staff, crisis, make, coronavirus, employee","['qatar', 'airway', 'axe', 'substantial', 'number', 'job', 'global', 'industry', 'face', 'grim', 'global', 'outlook', 'foreseeable', 'improvement', 'chief', 'executive', 'told', 'employee', 'may', 'letter', 'cabin', 'crew', 'akbar', 'al', 'baker', 'writes', 'truth', 'simply', 'sustain', 'current', 'staff', 'number', 'need', 'make', 'substantial', 'number', 'job', 'redundant', 'inclusive', 'cabin', 'detail', 'plan', 'reduction', 'communicate', 'upcoming', 'week', 'say', 'al', 'baker', 'letter', 'develop', 'special', 'recruitment', 'programme', 'ensure', 'staff', 'make', 'swift', 'return', 'opportunity', 'arise', 'decline', 'comment', 'far', 'many', 'job', 'affected', 'say', 'must', 'act', 'decisively', 'protect', 'future', 'qatar', 'airway', 'confirm', 'make', 'number', 'role', 'redundant', 'due', 'impact', 'coronavirus', 'state', 'job', 'loss', 'regrettable', 'work', 'closely', 'affected', 'employee', 'offer', 'full', 'support', 'difficult', 'al', 'baker', 'add', 'despite', 'effort', 'hope', 'quick', 'rebound', 'face', 'adversity', 'unprecedented', 'scale', 'global', 'outlook', 'industry', 'look', 'grim', 'many', 'closing', 'significantly', 'reduce', 'operation', 'qatar', 'airway', 'immune', 'dohabased', 'oneworld', 'member', 'must', 'face', 'reality', 'many', 'international', 'border', 'close', 'foreseeable', 'outlook', 'immediate', 'positive', 'change', 'say', 'al', 'baker', 'qatar', 'airway', 'resistance', 'cut', 'service', 'note', 'early', 'april', 'work', 'government', 'around', 'world', 'maintain', 'strong', 'schedule', 'organise', 'charter', 'need']"
"IATA is opposing any regulation that would require airlines to leave empty seats between passengers, arguing that such a measure would severely affect operators' economic prospects and yet deliver no “significant improvement in safety” for travellers. Keeping middle seats empty on narrowbodies with standard 3-3 cabin layouts will reduce capacity by a third, while the practice will typically lead to a 40% capacity reduction on long-haul jets, said IATA chief economist Brian Pearce during a media briefing on 5 May. On regional jets and turboprops – typically featuring 2-2 cabin layouts – the measure would halve capacity. Overall, Pearce says, airlines would be able to use just 62% of the industry's available capacity. In 2019, carriers needed – on average – load factors of 77% to break even. Out of 122 airlines analysed by IATA, only four would be able to operate profitably, Pearce says. If regulations to leave seats empty were to be introduced, Pearce expects that “most airlines will really struggle” and ticket prices would be “significantly higher” in the long term, compared with pre-crisis levels. IATA predicts that average fares would need to be increased 43-54% for airlines to break even. Meanwhile, the airline association says the practice of leaving seats empty has not been proven to reduce the risk of infection on board aircraft, even though the measure has been introduced by a number of airlines. IATA's medical advisor, David Powell, said during the briefing that the risk of coronavirus transmission on board aircraft “appears to be low”. The association has studied flights of 18 airlines and found three cases in which crew members were infected by passengers, and another four cases of virus transmission between pilots. But Powell says there was “no evidence” of virus transmission between passengers on board aircraft. Powell suspects that relatively high air-recirculation rates on board aircraft (compared with air-conditioning systems in offices), use of hospital-style HEPA filters, and forward-facing seats, which limit opportunity for face-to-face contact, all help keep low the infection risk during flight. IATA director general Alexandre de Juniac argues that while keeping seats empty would have “an enormous financial and operational impact on airlines”, the practice would bring “no additional guarantee of safety to avoid virus transmission”. He asks: “Is [it] necessary to implement a measure that would significantly [affect] the economics of the industry and ability of passengers to travel in good conditions without bringing an additional safety improvement?” IATA advocates the use of face masks by passengers and crew on board aircraft, alongside additional measures to reduce infection risks. These include temperature screening for passengers and staff, adjusted boarding and disembarkation processes to reduce contact, simplified catering, limited movement in aircraft cabin, and more intensive cabin-cleaning.",5,218,9.0,0.2102,"industry, crisis, demand, coronavirus, global, iata, market, level, cargo, expect","['iata', 'oppose', 'regulation', 'require', 'leave', 'empty', 'seat', 'passenger', 'argue', 'measure', 'severely', 'affect', 'operator', 'economic', 'prospect', 'yet', 'deliver', 'significant', 'improvement', 'safety', 'traveller', 'keep', 'middle', 'seat', 'empty', 'narrowbodies', 'standard', 'cabin', 'layout', 'reduce', 'capacity', 'third', 'practice', 'typically', 'lead', 'capacity', 'reduction', 'longhaul', 'jet', 'say', 'iata', 'chief', 'economist', 'brian', 'pearce', 'medium', 'briefing', 'may', 'regional', 'jet', 'turboprop', 'typically', 'feature', 'cabin', 'layout', 'measure', 'halve', 'capacity', 'overall', 'pearce', 'say', 'able', 'use', 'industry', 'available', 'capacity', 'carrier', 'need', 'average', 'load', 'factor', 'break', 'even', 'analyse', 'iata', 'able', 'operate', 'profitably', 'pearce', 'say', 'regulation', 'leave', 'seat', 'empty', 'introduce', 'pearce', 'expect', 'really', 'struggle', 'ticket', 'price', 'significantly', 'high', 'long', 'term', 'compare', 'precrisis', 'level', 'iata', 'predicts', 'average', 'fare', 'need', 'increase', 'break', 'even', 'meanwhile', 'association', 'say', 'practice', 'leave', 'seat', 'empty', 'proven', 'reduce', 'risk', 'infection', 'board', 'even', 'though', 'measure', 'introduce', 'number', 'iata', 'medical', 'advisor', 'david', 'powell', 'say', 'briefing', 'risk', 'coronavirus', 'transmission', 'board', 'appear', 'low', 'association', 'study', 'found', 'case', 'crew', 'member', 'infect', 'passenger', 'another', 'case', 'virus', 'transmission', 'pilot', 'powell', 'say', 'evidence', 'virus', 'transmission', 'passenger', 'board', 'powell', 'suspect', 'relatively', 'high', 'airrecirculation', 'rate', 'board', 'compare', 'airconditioning', 'system', 'office', 'use', 'hospitalstyle', 'hepa', 'filter', 'forwardfacing', 'seat', 'limit', 'opportunity', 'facetoface', 'contact', 'help', 'keep', 'low', 'infection', 'risk', 'iata', 'director', 'general', 'alexandre', 'de', 'juniac', 'argues', 'keep', 'seat', 'empty', 'enormous', 'financial', 'operational', 'impact', 'practice', 'bring', 'additional', 'guarantee', 'safety', 'avoid', 'virus', 'transmission', 'asks', 'necessary', 'implement', 'measure', 'significantly', 'affect', 'economics', 'industry', 'ability', 'passenger', 'travel', 'good', 'condition', 'without', 'bring', 'additional', 'safety', 'improvement', 'iata', 'advocate', 'use', 'face', 'mask', 'passenger', 'crew', 'board', 'alongside', 'additional', 'measure', 'reduce', 'infection', 'risk', 'include', 'temperature', 'screen', 'passenger', 'staff', 'adjust', 'boarding', 'disembarkation', 'process', 'reduce', 'contact', 'simplify', 'catering', 'limited', 'movement', 'cabin', 'intensive', 'cabincleaning']"
"Alaska Air Group reported a $321 million operating loss during the first quarter as it seeks to reduce costs during the coronavirus downturn, which is a far cry from the same period in 2019 when the carrier generated $25 million in operating profit. The parent company of Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air in an earnings call on 5 May said that it burned through $400 million during March when the USA began to issue shelter-in-place orders and close public gatherings. Its cash spend to continue operations reduced to $260 million in April, and Alaska aims to reduce its monthly spending to $200 million by June. This was the airline's first quarterly loss in a decade, Alaska chief executive Brad Tilden said during the call. “There is no doubt that our second-quarter loss will be much higher,” Tilden says. Operating revenue dropped 14% year-over-year from $1.87 billion in 2019 to $1.6 billion during the first quarter as passengers began to cancel flights and stop booking trips amid the increasing spread of coronavirus. Revenue per available seat mile (RASM) dropped by 12% year-over-year, while cost per available seat mile excluding fuel (CASM ex-fuel) rose by 2%. Alaska as of 4 May had $2.9 billion in liquidity, which includes the $992 million in payroll support provided by the federal CARES Act. The Seattle-based company agreed with the US treasury department that $267 million of those funds will be provided in the form of a loan that must be repaid. The payroll aid covers 70% of the parent company's budgeted payroll and benefits costs through 30 September. “We're going to be aggressive on the fundraising side” Tilden says, but hopes the airline will not accumulate extreme debt while raising additional capital. The carrier plans to apply for an additional $1.1 billion in CARES Act loans to support short-term liquidity and expects more guidance from the treasury department and the US Department of Transportation about conditions it would need to follow. Alaska views its fleet as an asset in seeking more capital. Alaska Airlines has 166 Boeing 737 type aircraft, 10 Airbus A321neo aircraft, 51 A320s and 10 A319s, according to Cirium fleets data. Horizon has 34 De Havilland Canada Dash 8 turboprops and 30 Embraer E175s. To reduce costs, Alaska has reduced capacity by 80% for April and May, grounding 156 aircraft, more than half of its 237-aircraft fleet. Discussions on lease deferrals also started in the second week of March, Alaska chief financial officer Shane Tackett says. The carrier has been able to “secure lease deferrals with all but two of our lessors”, with plans to repay deferrals within 12 months. In response to a question about possibly abandoning its order for 32 Boeing 737 Max aircraft, Tackett says the airline is still considering its fleet options. Serving the largest state by landmass and the closest to the Arctic, Alaska provides air bridges and cargo deliveries to remote communities. This responsibility became more urgent after the regional airlines of Alaska-based Ravn Air Group on 5 April suspended all operations and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection to obtain debtor in possession funding while applying for CARES Act funding. Despite reducing capacity to 20% for April and May, Alaska Air Group is coordinating with the state government and the Alaska Air Carriers Association to ensure communities stay connected.",5,219,9.0,0.2021,"industry, crisis, demand, coronavirus, global, iata, market, level, cargo, expect","['alaska', 'report', 'operating', 'loss', 'quarter', 'seek', 'reduce', 'cost', 'coronavirus', 'downturn', 'far', 'cry', 'period', 'carrier', 'generate', 'operating', 'profit', 'parent', 'alaska', 'horizon', 'earnings', 'call', 'may', 'say', 'burn', 'march', 'usa', 'begin', 'issue', 'shelterinplace', 'order', 'close', 'public', 'gathering', 'cash', 'spend', 'continue', 'operation', 'reduce', 'april', 'alaska', 'aim', 'reduce', 'monthly', 'spending', 'june', 'quarterly', 'loss', 'decade', 'alaska', 'chief', 'executive', 'brad', 'tilden', 'say', 'call', 'doubt', 'secondquarter', 'loss', 'much', 'high', 'tilden', 'say', 'operating', 'revenue', 'drop', 'yearoveryear', 'quarter', 'passenger', 'begin', 'cancel', 'stop', 'book', 'trip', 'amid', 'increase', 'spread', 'coronavirus', 'revenue', 'per', 'available', 'seat', 'mile', 'rasm', 'drop', 'yearoveryear', 'cost', 'per', 'available', 'seat', 'mile', 'exclude', 'fuel', 'casm', 'exfuel', 'rise', 'alaska', 'may', 'liquidity', 'include', 'payroll', 'support', 'provide', 'federal', 'care', 'act', 'seattlebased', 'agree', 'u', 'treasury', 'department', 'fund', 'provide', 'form', 'loan', 'must', 'repaid', 'payroll', 'aid', 'cover', 'parent', 'budget', 'payroll', 'benefit', 'cost', 'september', 'go', 'aggressive', 'fundraise', 'side', 'tilden', 'say', 'hope', 'accumulate', 'extreme', 'debt', 'raise', 'additional', 'capital', 'carrier', 'plan', 'apply', 'additional', 'care', 'act', 'loan', 'support', 'shortterm', 'liquidity', 'expect', 'guidance', 'treasury', 'department', 'u', 'department', 'transportation', 'condition', 'need', 'follow', 'alaska', 'view', 'fleet', 'asset', 'seek', 'capital', 'alaska', 'type', 'accord', 'fleet', 'data', 'horizon', 'de', 'havilland', 'canada', 'dash', 'turboprop', 'embraer', 'reduce', 'cost', 'alaska', 'reduce', 'capacity', 'april', 'may', 'ground', 'half', 'fleet', 'discussion', 'lease', 'deferral', 'start', 'second', 'week', 'march', 'alaska', 'chief', 'financial', 'officer', 'shane', 'tackett', 'say', 'carrier', 'able', 'secure', 'lease', 'deferral', 'lessor', 'plan', 'repay', 'deferral', 'within', 'month', 'response', 'question', 'possibly', 'abandon', 'order', 'tackett', 'say', 'still', 'consider', 'fleet', 'option', 'serve', 'large', 'state', 'landmass', 'closest', 'arctic', 'alaska', 'provide', 'bridge', 'cargo', 'delivery', 'remote', 'community', 'responsibility', 'become', 'urgent', 'regional', 'alaskabased', 'ravn', 'april', 'suspend', 'operation', 'file', 'chapter', 'bankruptcy', 'protection', 'obtain', 'debtor', 'possession', 'funding', 'apply', 'care', 'act', 'funding', 'despite', 'reduce', 'capacity', 'april', 'may', 'alaska', 'coordinate', 'state', 'government', 'alaska', 'carrier', 'association', 'ensure', 'community', 'stay', 'connect']"
"Gulfstream is slashing jobs across its operation to mitigate the effects of the coronavirus pandemic on its business and ensure its long-term viability. The company will also close its Las Vegas service centre in June, and move the work to its nearby facility in Van Nuys, California. Gulfstream says the “ongoing challenges from Covid-19 have led to a decrease in the company's projected 2020 deliveries”. Output of between 125-130 business jets is now planned, compared with the original forecast for the year of 150 G650/ERs, G600s, G550s, G500s and G280s. The company says the cost-cutting measures it has already undertaken to address the challenges caused by the pandemic, “were not sufficient to overcome this significant impact, requiring us to take additional steps to balance the size and structure of the business with current conditions”. As a result, it adds “we recently made the difficult decision to reduce our workforce at multiple locations across our company”. This includes 700 job losses at its Savannah headquarters. Gulfstream says “the biggest factors” contributing to its decision to shut the Las Vegas service centre are “the proximity, central location and significant customer resources” at its Van Nuys base, including the availability of sustainable aviation fuel and increased ramp space for parking. “These are challenging and unprecedented times that require us to make difficult decisions to ensure the long-term health of the business,” says Gulfstream. “We sincerely regret the impact these actions will have on our colleagues and their families.” Gulfstream shipped 23 business jets in the first quarter, down from 34 a year ago. It also produced another 11 aircraft, which could not be delivered to customers due to international travel restrictions imposed by the coronavirus outbreak. On the first-quarter earnings call on 29 April with Gulfstream's parent, General Dynamics, chief executive Phebe Novakovic said the constrained travel environment is also impacting sales of new aircraft due to the challenge of closing a deal. “It is difficult for our people to make in-person sales calls; we can't take customers on demonstration rides, and it is difficult to get folks together to work on contract issues,” she said.

"UK long-haul carrier Virgin Atlantic is to cut over 3,100 jobs and retire its Boeing 747-400s in an effort to address the financial pressure of the coronavirus crisis. The airline says it will “immediately suspend” the use of all seven of its 747-400s and is still intending to retire four Airbus A330s, as previously planned, in early 2022. Virgin Atlantic has been introducing Airbus A350-1000s which are gradually replacing the operator's A340-600s and 747s, and it is also set to acquire A330-900s. The airline says its fleet will comprise 36 twin-engined aircraft, including Boeing 787s, from summer 2022. It is temporarily shifting its operations away from London Gatwick, moving its flight programme to London Heathrow instead – although it stresses that it will be retaining its Gatwick slots in order to return once demand improves. Virgin Atlantic says the post-coronavirus recovery could take up to three years. While it is still holding “constructive” discussions with the UK government and other stakeholders, as it explores funding options, the carrier says it needs to reduce costs. It has commenced a 45-day consultation with its unions, stating that it must “regrettably” cut 3,150 personnel. “We have weathered many storms since our first flight,” says chief executive Shai Weiss. “None has been as devastating as [coronavirus].” He says the airline needs to return to profitability in 2021. Virgin Atlantic will incorporate its name into its leisure operation, rebranding it as Virgin Atlantic Holidays. The division will continue to concentrate on digital distribution, and the company says 15% of its retail estate will close this year.",5,221,8.0,0.2013,"government, uk, carrier, business, state, share, south, airway, financial, plan","['uk', 'longhaul', 'carrier', 'virgin', 'atlantic', 'cut', 'job', 'retire', 'effort', 'address', 'financial', 'pressure', 'coronavirus', 'crisis', 'say', 'immediately', 'suspend', 'use', 'still', 'intend', 'retire', 'previously', 'plan', 'early', 'virgin', 'atlantic', 'introduce', 'gradually', 'replace', 'operator', 'set', 'acquire', 'say', 'fleet', 'comprise', 'twinengined', 'include', 'summer', 'temporarily', 'shift', 'operation', 'away', 'london', 'gatwick', 'move', 'programme', 'london', 'heathrow', 'instead', 'although', 'stress', 'retain', 'gatwick', 'slot', 'order', 'return', 'demand', 'improves', 'virgin', 'atlantic', 'say', 'postcoronavirus', 'recovery', 'take', 'still', 'hold', 'constructive', 'discussion', 'uk', 'government', 'stakeholder', 'explores', 'funding', 'option', 'carrier', 'say', 'need', 'reduce', 'cost', 'commenced', 'consultation', 'union', 'state', 'must', 'regrettably', 'cut', 'personnel', 'weather', 'many', 'storm', 'since', 'say', 'chief', 'executive', 'shai', 'wei', 'none', 'devastate', 'coronavirus', 'say', 'need', 'return', 'profitability', 'virgin', 'atlantic', 'incorporate', 'name', 'leisure', 'operation', 'rebranding', 'virgin', 'atlantic', 'holiday', 'division', 'continue', 'concentrate', 'digital', 'distribution', 'say', 'retail', 'estate', 'close']"
"Portuguese investigators believe a failure to control the derotation of a Delta Air Lines Boeing 757-200 resulted in a heavy nose-gear impact severe enough to buckle the fuselage. The aircraft (N543US), arriving in the Azores from New York JFK on 18 August last year, had touched down normally with its main landing-gear on Ponta Delgada's runway 12. Portuguese accident investigation authority GPIAAF says the first officer's piloting technique – which demonstrated “excessive corrections” of attitude and thrust, possibly in response to a variable crosswind – resulted in a heavy nose-down elevator input to derotate after the main gear contact. This might have been exacerbated by a reduction of engine thrust during the derotation – increasing the moment around the lateral axis – and the inquiry also points out that braking can require aft control-column pressure to reduce the derotation rate. Flight-data recordings indicate a 1.53g main-gear contact followed by a nose-gear impact of 1.88g, says GPIAAF. The aircraft had been operating at just 1% below its maximum landing weight of 89.8t and the inquiry believes this contributed to the extent of structural damage. Several fuselage areas suffered deformation from compression stresses, with stringers cracking and skin wrinkling evident on the upper central and lower forward fuselage, consisted with nose-gear overload. The flight data reveals several control column pitch movements of “increasing amplitude” in the moments before landing, says the inquiry, followed by a sharp nose-down input after main-gear touchdown and then a sudden nose-up correction after the nose-gear impact. Boeing had previously detailed the risk of damage from hard nose-gear contacts on the 757 and 767 resulting from full or nearly-full forward control-column input after main-gear touchdown. “Enough nose-down elevator authority exists to damage the airframe structure if the [aircraft] is rapidly derotated following main-gear touchdown,” it stated in an April 2002 analysis. “This is possible because the maximum nose-down elevator authority is designed to control go-arounds, which require considerably more longitudinal control than the landing manoeuvre.” Boeing states that the aircraft damage from such accidents is typically “significant” and results in “lengthy and expensive repairs”.  The US airframer says it first recognised that heavy loads on the nose-gear could damage the fuselage during flight-testing of the Boeing 727-200 in the 1960s. “Flight-test data from various landings with high nose-down pitch rates led Boeing to enhance design requirements,” it states. These have included optimising hydraulic flow within the nose-gear oleo strut to absorb energy and strengthening upper crown fuselage stringers. Boeing also produced training videos to increase crew awareness of the potential for airframe damage arising from excessive derotation. “Flight crews can accomplish [a smooth derotation] by controlling the airplane pitch rate while relaxing aft column pressure,” it says, adding: “Control-column movement forward of the neutral position should not be needed.” None of the 161 passengers and seven crew members on board the Delta 757 at Ponta Delgada was injured, says GPIAAF, which published its findings into the accident on 24 April.",5,222,7.0,0.5351,"crew, runway, inquiry, land, approach, accident, investigator, captain, incident, pilot","['portuguese', 'investigator', 'believe', 'failure', 'control', 'derotation', 'delta', 'line', 'result', 'heavy', 'nosegear', 'impact', 'severe', 'enough', 'buckle', 'fuselage', 'arrive', 'azores', 'york', 'jfk', 'august', 'touch', 'normally', 'main', 'landinggear', 'ponta', 'delgada', 'runway', 'portuguese', 'accident', 'investigation', 'authority', 'gpiaaf', 'say', 'officer', 'pilot', 'technique', 'demonstrate', 'excessive', 'correction', 'attitude', 'thrust', 'possibly', 'response', 'variable', 'crosswind', 'result', 'heavy', 'nosedown', 'elevator', 'input', 'derotate', 'main', 'gear', 'contact', 'might', 'exacerbate', 'reduction', 'engine', 'thrust', 'derotation', 'increase', 'moment', 'around', 'lateral', 'axis', 'inquiry', 'point', 'brake', 'require', 'aft', 'controlcolumn', 'pressure', 'reduce', 'derotation', 'rate', 'flightdata', 'recording', 'indicate', 'maingear', 'contact', 'follow', 'nosegear', 'impact', 'say', 'gpiaaf', 'operating', 'maximum', 'land', 'weight', 'inquiry', 'believe', 'contribute', 'extent', 'structural', 'damage', 'several', 'fuselage', 'area', 'suffer', 'deformation', 'compression', 'stress', 'stringer', 'crack', 'skin', 'wrinkle', 'evident', 'upper', 'central', 'low', 'forward', 'fuselage', 'consist', 'nosegear', 'overload', 'data', 'reveals', 'several', 'control', 'column', 'pitch', 'movement', 'increase', 'amplitude', 'moment', 'land', 'say', 'inquiry', 'follow', 'sharp', 'nosedown', 'input', 'maingear', 'touchdown', 'sudden', 'noseup', 'correction', 'nosegear', 'impact', 'previously', 'detailed', 'risk', 'damage', 'hard', 'nosegear', 'contact', 'result', 'full', 'nearlyfull', 'forward', 'controlcolumn', 'input', 'maingear', 'touchdown', 'enough', 'nosedown', 'elevator', 'authority', 'exists', 'damage', 'airframe', 'structure', 'rapidly', 'derotated', 'follow', 'maingear', 'touchdown', 'state', 'april', 'analysis', 'possible', 'maximum', 'nosedown', 'elevator', 'authority', 'design', 'control', 'goarounds', 'require', 'considerably', 'longitudinal', 'control', 'land', 'state', 'damage', 'accident', 'typically', 'significant', 'result', 'lengthy', 'expensive', 'repair', 'u', 'airframer', 'say', 'recognise', 'heavy', 'load', 'nosegear', 'damage', 'fuselage', 'flighttesting', 'flighttest', 'data', 'various', 'landing', 'high', 'nosedown', 'pitch', 'rate', 'lead', 'enhance', 'design', 'requirement', 'state', 'include', 'optimise', 'hydraulic', 'flow', 'within', 'nosegear', 'oleo', 'strut', 'absorb', 'energy', 'strengthen', 'upper', 'crown', 'fuselage', 'stringer', 'produce', 'training', 'video', 'increase', 'crew', 'awareness', 'potential', 'airframe', 'damage', 'arise', 'excessive', 'derotation', 'crew', 'accomplish', 'smooth', 'derotation', 'control', 'airplane', 'pitch', 'rate', 'relax', 'aft', 'column', 'pressure', 'say', 'add', 'controlcolumn', 'movement', 'forward', 'neutral', 'position', 'none', 'passenger', 'crew', 'member', 'board', 'delta', 'ponta', 'delgada', 'injured', 'say', 'gpiaaf', 'publish', 'finding', 'accident', 'april']"
"Russian investigators probing the Aeroflot Sukhoi Superjet 100 crash at Moscow Sheremetyevo a year ago are still awaiting results of specific fire and structural analyses before releasing their final findings about the accident. But the Interstate Aviation Committee says some of the work – including US manufacturer Curtiss-Wright's assessment of fire-protection units – has been held up by restrictive measures imposed during the coronavirus crisis. The inquiry is yet to complete research into the probability of fire occurring and spreading after the aircraft lands, which is being carried out by St Petersburg's university for the state fire service. It is also awaiting the results of assessment into the collapse of the aircraft's landing-gear and damage to the fuel tanks in the wing, and analysis of compliance with design requirements of landing-gear struts and attachment points. This work will be carried out by the investigators once they receive the results of undercarriage load modelling being performed by French aerospace firm Safran. While returning to Sheremetyevo, after a lightning strike on 5 May last year, the aircraft bounced on landing. Its landing-gear failed during the impact and the subsequent damage to the engines and fuel tanks led to a severe fire as the jet came to a halt, resulting in 41 fatalities. The Interstate Aviation Committee says it is trying to finish the inquiry promptly, but the need to comply with local and federal coronavirus restrictions at its Moscow headquarters is “significantly affecting” the completion time. Investigators have completed the analysis of wreckage and flight-recorder information, as well as mathematical modelling of the flight – including assessment of Superjet aerodynamics and performance following external disturbances. The inquiry has looked into Aeroflot Superjet crew training and simulator capabilities, and previous instances of switching of the aircraft's flight-control mode to direct law, as well as cases of hard landings. Investigators are looking into the psychological and personal characteristics of the crew, but full details were only submitted by the carrier at the end of February, the inquiry says. As well as the routine examination of air traffic control and meteorological data, several devices and units with non-volatile memories, which might hold additional flight information, have been removed from the aircraft. Structural lightning-strike analysis has been carried out in co-operation with Sukhoi, Aeroflot and Rosaviatsia, and research has also been undertaken into the weather radar, electronic engine-management system, avionics, power supplies, fuel controls and shut-of valves, flight controls and radio equipment.",5,223,7.0,0.3055,"crew, runway, inquiry, land, approach, accident, investigator, captain, incident, pilot","['russian', 'investigator', 'probe', 'aeroflot', 'sukhoi', 'superjet', 'crash', 'moscow', 'sheremetyevo', 'ago', 'still', 'await', 'result', 'specific', 'fire', 'structural', 'analysis', 'release', 'final', 'finding', 'accident', 'interstate', 'committee', 'say', 'work', 'include', 'u', 'manufacturer', 'curtisswright', 'assessment', 'fireprotection', 'unit', 'held', 'restrictive', 'measure', 'impose', 'coronavirus', 'crisis', 'inquiry', 'yet', 'complete', 'research', 'probability', 'fire', 'occur', 'spread', 'land', 'carry', 'st', 'petersburg', 'university', 'state', 'fire', 'service', 'await', 'result', 'assessment', 'collapse', 'landinggear', 'damage', 'fuel', 'tank', 'wing', 'analysis', 'compliance', 'design', 'requirement', 'landinggear', 'strut', 'attachment', 'point', 'work', 'carry', 'investigator', 'receive', 'result', 'undercarriage', 'load', 'model', 'perform', 'french', 'firm', 'safran', 'return', 'sheremetyevo', 'lightning', 'strike', 'may', 'bounce', 'land', 'landinggear', 'fail', 'impact', 'subsequent', 'damage', 'engine', 'fuel', 'tank', 'lead', 'severe', 'fire', 'jet', 'come', 'halt', 'result', 'fatality', 'interstate', 'committee', 'say', 'try', 'finish', 'inquiry', 'promptly', 'need', 'comply', 'local', 'federal', 'coronavirus', 'restriction', 'moscow', 'headquarters', 'significantly', 'affect', 'completion', 'investigator', 'complete', 'analysis', 'wreckage', 'flightrecorder', 'information', 'well', 'mathematical', 'model', 'include', 'assessment', 'superjet', 'aerodynamics', 'performance', 'follow', 'external', 'disturbance', 'inquiry', 'look', 'aeroflot', 'superjet', 'crew', 'training', 'simulator', 'capability', 'previous', 'instance', 'switch', 'flightcontrol', 'mode', 'direct', 'law', 'well', 'case', 'hard', 'landing', 'investigator', 'look', 'psychological', 'personal', 'characteristic', 'crew', 'full', 'detail', 'submit', 'carrier', 'end', 'february', 'inquiry', 'say', 'well', 'routine', 'examination', 'traffic', 'control', 'meteorological', 'data', 'several', 'device', 'unit', 'nonvolatile', 'memory', 'might', 'hold', 'additional', 'information', 'remove', 'structural', 'lightningstrike', 'analysis', 'carry', 'cooperation', 'sukhoi', 'aeroflot', 'rosaviatsia', 'research', 'undertaken', 'weather', 'radar', 'electronic', 'enginemanagement', 'system', 'avionics', 'power', 'supply', 'fuel', 'control', 'shutof', 'valve', 'control', 'radio', 'equipment']"
"Air Canada incurred a C$1.05 billion ($744 million) net loss in the first quarter of 2020, compared with a C$285 million net profit a year ago, and is warning that it will take “at least three years” for revenue and capacity levels to return to those seen in 2019. The carrier reported a C$433 million operating loss for the three months ended 31 March, after an operating profit of C$127 million in the same period last year. First-quarter revenue fell 16% to C$3.7 billion.  “The past quarter was the first in 27 consecutive quarters that we did not report year-over-year operating revenue growth,” notes Air Canada chief executive Calin Rovinescu. “Our solid January and February results gave us every encouragement that this performance would continue until the sudden and catastrophic impact of Covid-19's onset in Europe and North America in early March.” He adds that the Canadian carrier is “living through the darkest period ever in the history of commercial aviation”. Air Canada has reduced capacity by 85-90% in the second quarter and expects capacity in the third quarter to be 75% lower than in the same period last year. It says it will “continue to dynamically adjust capacity” in line with travel restrictions, border closures and passenger demand. “[I]t is our current expectation that it will take at least three years to recover to 2019 levels of revenue and capacity,” states Rovinescu. “We expect that both the overall industry and our airline will be considerably smaller for some time, which will unfortunately result in significant reductions in both fleet and employee levels.” Air Canada is accelerating the retirement of 79 Boeing 767s, Airbus A319s and Embraer 190s from its fleet. The Embraer aircraft are exiting immediately. The airline says it had C$6.5 billion in unrestricted liquidity at the end of the first quarter, down from C$7.4 billion at the end of 2019. “We reacted quickly to the severity and abrupt impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, taking numerous measures including drawing down credit lines and completing other financings to increase our liquidity,” states Rovinescu.",5,224,3.0,0.3283,"passenger, loss, operating, revenue, traffic, month, increase, capacity, decline, result","['canada', 'incur', 'c', 'net', 'loss', 'quarter', 'compare', 'c', 'net', 'profit', 'ago', 'warn', 'take', 'least', 'revenue', 'capacity', 'level', 'return', 'see', 'carrier', 'report', 'c', 'operating', 'loss', 'month', 'end', 'march', 'operating', 'profit', 'c', 'period', 'firstquarter', 'revenue', 'fell', 'c', 'past', 'quarter', 'consecutive', 'quarter', 'report', 'yearoveryear', 'operating', 'revenue', 'growth', 'note', 'canada', 'chief', 'executive', 'calin', 'rovinescu', 'solid', 'january', 'february', 'result', 'give', 'u', 'every', 'encouragement', 'performance', 'continue', 'sudden', 'catastrophic', 'impact', 'coronavirus', 'onset', 'europe', 'north', 'america', 'early', 'add', 'canadian', 'carrier', 'living', 'darkest', 'period', 'ever', 'history', 'commercial', 'canada', 'reduce', 'capacity', 'second', 'quarter', 'expect', 'capacity', 'third', 'quarter', 'low', 'period', 'say', 'continue', 'dynamically', 'adjust', 'capacity', 'line', 'travel', 'restriction', 'border', 'closure', 'passenger', 'demand', 'current', 'expectation', 'take', 'least', 'recover', 'level', 'revenue', 'capacity', 'state', 'rovinescu', 'expect', 'overall', 'industry', 'considerably', 'small', 'unfortunately', 'result', 'significant', 'reduction', 'fleet', 'employee', 'canada', 'accelerate', 'retirement', 'embraer', 'fleet', 'embraer', 'exit', 'immediately', 'say', 'c', 'unrestricted', 'liquidity', 'end', 'quarter', 'c', 'end', 'react', 'quickly', 'severity', 'abrupt', 'impact', 'coronavirus', 'pandemic', 'take', 'numerous', 'measure', 'include', 'draw', 'credit', 'line', 'complete', 'financing', 'increase', 'liquidity', 'state', 'rovinescu']"
"The head of Germany's BDLI aerospace trade body is warning that many of the country's smaller suppliers could go out of business unless Airbus can maintain at least half its pre-crisis output over the next two years. Germany's sector has thrived on the back of Airbus's commercial growth, with around a third of its production in the country, but Volker Thum, managing director of BDLI, says that is now threatened by the coronavirus outbreak. “Unless we can guarantee a minimum delivery level for Airbus, a whole industry that has been built over 40 years will collapse. If we don't get to that minimum level – 50% for widebodies and 60% for narrowbodies – we are finished,” he says. Thum says many Airbus suppliers have been shielded from major cash flow problems during the initial weeks of the crisis because the airframer's terms mean it is paying now for deliveries made at the beginning of the year. However, these payments will start to fall away within 90 days, he says, so there are “only a few weeks left to establish a plan”. In addition, many companies are facing immediate bills for raw materials such as carbonfibre resin, titanium, and aluminium that they have ordered up front. Businesses have also been encouraged to invest in machinery to meet higher demand from Airbus, and have heavy interest payments on their borrowings, he says. Thum, who spent 25 years with Airbus before joining BDLI in 2015, says a priority for small- and medium-sized enterprises is to “keep skilled people on the payroll” as orders dry up. Otherwise, he says, it will be difficult for them to ramp-up again when demand comes back. Government initiatives to pay around two thirds of the salary of furloughed workers, and to offer state-guaranteed loans have softened the blow, he says. Several prominent German companies have announced production cuts since the onset of the crisis. Engine systems maker MTU began a “gradual restart of operations” on 20 April after a three-week suspension, initially with just a fifth of employees returning to work. On 7 April, MRO provider Lufthansa Technik put 12,000 staff on short-term working until the end of August.

"Hainan Airlines swung back into the red for its first-quarter results for 2020, joining other Chinese carriers who reported losses amid the coronavirus outbreak. However, the carrier, China's fourth largest, is optimistic its financial results will improve in the second quarter, as it “adjusts its business strategy” and cuts costs further, though it did not go into further detail. For the three months ended 31 March, the carrier reported an operating loss of CNY8.59 billion ($1.22 billion), reversing the modest CNY1.62 billion profit it turned the same period last year. The carrier witnessed passenger demand collapse for the quarter, leading to a dramatic 63% decrease in revenue, which came in at CNY6.89 billion. Expenses fell 21.9% to CNY13.9 billion, on the back of reduced flight operations due to travel restrictions. It reported an attributable net loss of CNY6.29 billion for the period, a stark contrast to last year's net profit of CNY1.14 billion. Hainan ended the period with lower cash and cash equivalents – CNY3.6 billion, compared to CNY5.93 billion at the start of the year. Hainan is the latest in a growing list of Chinese carriers to see their financial results impacted by the coronavirus outbreak, which originated from the country. China's three largest carriers – Air China, China Eastern Airlines and China Southern Airlines –all posted losses for the quarter, resulting from slumps in travel demand. On the same day, Hainan also released its full-year results for 2019, which told a markedly different story. The carrier reversed its full-year loss for 2018, posting an operating profit of CNY829 million. Revenue for the year rose 6.8% to CNY72.4 billion, while expenses increased 4.6% to CNY76.6 billion. Hainan posted a modest net profit of CNY543 million, compared to 2018's net loss of CNY3.59 billion. The carrier disclosed on the stock exchange separately that it will do away with planned profit distribution for its 2019 results.

"Icelandair Group is expecting employee cuts to reduce its cash outflow by $12 million per month over the next three months, taking into account measures by the government to pay partial salaries. The company is expecting to reveal a first-quarter loss of $208 million when it details its performance for the first three months of 2020 on 4 May. It has taken a goodwill impairment of $115 million, owing to the adverse effect of the coronavirus crisis on near-term operations. Negative fuel-hedging impacts have cost $51 million and the company has transferred $18 million to margin accounts with counterparties in response. Icelandic prime minister KatrÃ­n Jakobsdottir, speaking on 3 May, said the economic burden from the crisis was “profound” and its duration uncertain. “The tourism industry is hit the most,” she says, pointing out that it accounted for 40% of the country's export revenues. Iceland's border will remain shut until 15 May. “Air transport is down, borders are broadly closed, and people's willingness to travel is low,” says Jakobsdottir. The government, says Icelandair Group, is willing to consider granting the company a conditional credit line – or at least a guarantee for one. Its financial performance for the first two months of the year had been in accordance with expectations but the situation deteriorated substantially in March, and first-quarter revenues were down 16% to $209 million. Although its liquidity position is still above its $200 million internal minimum, the airline company expects to dip below this threshold “in the next few weeks” and has been working to prop up its finances. Icelandair Group is aiming to issue new shares to raise $200 million if the measure is approved at a shareholders' meeting on 22 May. Completing such a share offering is among the conditions for a government credit line. “Successful negotiations with relevant unions are essential,” the company adds.

"China's Juneyao Air swung to a loss in the first quarter of this year and expects further losses for the remaining first half of 2020 as the coronavirus pandemic puts a damper on demand. The Shanghai-based carrier posted a net loss of over CNY491 million ($69.5 million) in the first quarter of 2020, reversing the net profit of CNY400 million during the same period in 2019. Operating losses for the quarter were over CNY563 million, as compared to an operating profit of CNY459 million last year. Revenue for the quarter ended 31 March was CNY2.38 billion, a decline of 42.4% year-on-year. The airline's cash position at the end of the first quarter of 2020 amounted to CNY1.86 billion, down 21% on the corresponding quarter in 2019. “The coronavirus pandemic has had a great impact on the transportation industry where the company is located. Demand and willingness of passengers to travel have declined,” Juneyao Air says. It adds that it has been adjusting capacity, strengthening cost control, and reducing its annual aircraft introduction plan to ensure the company's cash flow is stable. “Up to now, there is great uncertainty about the duration and severity of the pandemic. Based on the preliminary judgement of the current situation, the company expects that the accumulated net profit in the first half of 2020 will have a loss.”",5,228,3.0,0.4359,"passenger, loss, operating, revenue, traffic, month, increase, capacity, decline, result","['juneyao', 'swung', 'loss', 'quarter', 'expect', 'far', 'loss', 'remain', 'half', 'coronavirus', 'pandemic', 'put', 'damper', 'demand', 'shanghaibased', 'carrier', 'post', 'net', 'loss', 'quarter', 'reverse', 'net', 'profit', 'period', 'operating', 'loss', 'quarter', 'compare', 'operating', 'profit', 'revenue', 'quarter', 'end', 'march', 'decline', 'yearonyear', 'cash', 'position', 'end', 'quarter', 'amount', 'correspond', 'quarter', 'coronavirus', 'pandemic', 'great', 'impact', 'transportation', 'industry', 'locate', 'demand', 'willingness', 'passenger', 'travel', 'decline', 'juneyao', 'say', 'add', 'adjust', 'capacity', 'strengthen', 'cost', 'control', 'reduce', 'annual', 'introduction', 'plan', 'ensure', 'cash', 'flow', 'stable', 'great', 'uncertainty', 'duration', 'severity', 'pandemic', 'base', 'preliminary', 'judgement', 'current', 'situation', 'expect', 'accumulate', 'net', 'profit', 'half', 'loss']"
"South Africa's political opposition is insisting the government detail an agreement with South African Airways unions setting out plans to establish a successor to the crumbling flag-carrier. In a response accusing the department of public enterprises of undermining SAA's business rescue practitioners, the Democratic Alliance says it will seek a commitment that the government will not make “any further bailouts” to the airline, or provide any state guarantees or other form of security. It is to ask public enterprises minister Pravin Gordhan for clarity on a “leadership compact” reached between various parties in SAA, arguing that the information provided about the agreement is “scant on detail”. “The question that all South Africans will be asking is whether or not this deal includes yet more billions of rands in bailouts to keep the bankrupt airline going,” says the party, “and whether or not majority ownership of SAA will be transferred to private equity?” SAA had been undergoing business rescue but the process ran out of funding, leading the rescue practitioners to state the carrier had only two options – either immediate liquidation or a deal with employees for a retrenchment package. But the department of public enterprises says the new agreement is part of a “bold and audacious” process committing all parties to a “new approach”, demanding “major performance-based culture change” if South Africa is to retain competitive and profitable international airlift through a strategic national asset with both public and private participation. “It will not be the old SAA but the beginning of a new journey to a new restructured airline, which will be a proud flagship for South Africa,” the department states. “The transition to the new airline may require sacrifices, pain and hardships for all concerned, particularly for those employees who may be displaced.” It adds that it is working with unions on a business model to give a new national carrier a competitive edge. “The agreed intention is to produce an airline which is a catalyst for investment, job creation in key sectors, economic growth throughout all regions of the country,” the department states, “and is a mirror to the world reflecting the splendour and beauty of our great nation.” But the Democratic Alliance describes as “astounding” the unions' and public enterprises minister's belief that they can enter an agreement that “apparently has no details” and that SAA's rescue practitioners – Les Matuson and Siviwe Dongwana – are simply expected to implement it, regardless of the expiry of a 1 May deadline for retrenchment packages. The opposition party accuses the minister of sidelining the practitioners, and says the practitioners are allowing the minister to “dictate” to them a course of action. “It is unbelievable,” it adds, pointing out that the practitioners have an obligation to follow South African company law and either devise an acceptable rescue plan or, if this is not possible, apply for liquidation. Heavily loss-making SAA has spent five months in business rescue and the emergence of the coronavirus crisis has essentially wrecked the carrier's chances of survival. “The public deserves clarity on the future of SAA and the full details of any agreements the minister has entered into,” says the Democratic Alliance. It adds that the government needs to guarantee that public money will “not be wasted on a lost cause”, particularly during the coronavirus crisis.",5,229,8.0,0.5733,"government, uk, carrier, business, state, share, south, airway, financial, plan","['south', 'africa', 'political', 'opposition', 'insist', 'government', 'detail', 'agreement', 'south', 'african', 'airway', 'union', 'set', 'plan', 'establish', 'successor', 'crumble', 'flagcarrier', 'response', 'accuse', 'department', 'public', 'enterprise', 'undermine', 'saa', 'business', 'rescue', 'practitioner', 'democratic', 'alliance', 'say', 'seek', 'commitment', 'government', 'make', 'far', 'bailouts', 'provide', 'state', 'guarantee', 'form', 'security', 'ask', 'public', 'enterprise', 'minister', 'pravin', 'gordhan', 'clarity', 'leadership', 'compact', 'reach', 'various', 'party', 'saa', 'argue', 'information', 'provide', 'agreement', 'scant', 'detail', 'question', 'south', 'african', 'ask', 'whether', 'deal', 'include', 'yet', 'rand', 'bailouts', 'keep', 'bankrupt', 'go', 'say', 'party', 'whether', 'majority', 'ownership', 'saa', 'transfer', 'private', 'equity', 'saa', 'undergo', 'business', 'rescue', 'process', 'ran', 'funding', 'lead', 'rescue', 'practitioner', 'state', 'carrier', 'option', 'either', 'immediate', 'liquidation', 'deal', 'employee', 'retrenchment', 'package', 'department', 'public', 'enterprise', 'say', 'agreement', 'part', 'bold', 'audacious', 'process', 'commit', 'party', 'approach', 'demand', 'major', 'performancebased', 'culture', 'change', 'south', 'africa', 'retain', 'competitive', 'profitable', 'international', 'airlift', 'strategic', 'national', 'asset', 'public', 'private', 'participation', 'old', 'saa', 'begin', 'journey', 'restructure', 'proud', 'flagship', 'south', 'africa', 'department', 'state', 'transition', 'may', 'require', 'sacrifice', 'pain', 'hardship', 'concerned', 'particularly', 'employee', 'may', 'add', 'work', 'union', 'business', 'model', 'give', 'national', 'carrier', 'competitive', 'edge', 'agree', 'intention', 'produce', 'catalyst', 'investment', 'job', 'creation', 'key', 'sector', 'economic', 'growth', 'throughout', 'region', 'country', 'department', 'state', 'mirror', 'world', 'reflect', 'splendour', 'beauty', 'great', 'democratic', 'alliance', 'describes', 'astound', 'union', 'public', 'enterprise', 'minister', 'belief', 'enter', 'agreement', 'apparently', 'detail', 'saa', 'rescue', 'practitioner', 'le', 'matuson', 'siviwe', 'dongwana', 'simply', 'expect', 'implement', 'regardless', 'expiry', 'may', 'deadline', 'retrenchment', 'package', 'opposition', 'party', 'accuses', 'minister', 'sideline', 'practitioner', 'say', 'practitioner', 'allow', 'minister', 'dictate', 'course', 'action', 'unbelievable', 'add', 'point', 'practitioner', 'obligation', 'follow', 'south', 'african', 'law', 'either', 'devise', 'acceptable', 'rescue', 'plan', 'possible', 'apply', 'liquidation', 'heavily', 'lossmaking', 'saa', 'spent', 'month', 'business', 'rescue', 'emergence', 'coronavirus', 'crisis', 'essentially', 'wreck', 'carrier', 'chance', 'survival', 'public', 'deserves', 'clarity', 'future', 'saa', 'full', 'detail', 'agreement', 'minister', 'enter', 'say', 'democratic', 'alliance', 'add', 'government', 'need', 'guarantee', 'public', 'money', 'waste', 'lose', 'cause', 'particularly', 'coronavirus', 'crisis']"
"UK regional carrier Flybe's administrators intend to appeal to the government in a bid to retain the airline's operating licence, warning that a sale of the business would become improbable if the licence is revoked. Flybe ceased operations on 5 March and voluntarily suspended its operating and maintenance licences. The administrators believe that a going-concern sale of the business and assets “may be possible” and is being “fully explored”, according to a statement of proposals. Its efforts have resulted in over 200 interested parties and 90 issued information memoranda, and generated submissions of around 20 non-binding offers. There are three parties which have shown an interest in a transaction for the business and assets – although not necessarily the company as a legal entity – and the administrators are working towards receiving final offers for evaluation in early May. Although negotiations are continuing, the administrators point out that the coronavirus crisis makes the timeframe to complete a sale “challenging”, owing to travel restrictions, capital constraints, eroding valuations and “diminished bidder appetite”. Flybe's operating licence potentially presents another obstacle. The administrators had appealed a licence revocation notice issued immediately after the carrier ceased operations, and the matter was heard by a Civil Aviation Authority panel on 27 March. But the CAA ruled on 16 April that it intended to support the revocation, arguing that progress in the acquisitions process did not support a realistic prospect of a transaction. The administrators dispute this view, and insist that maintaining the licence will “best enable” them to achieve a sale of the airline. “It is unlikely that a business sale, including the transfer of existing employees, will be possible if the operating licence is revoked, since it prevents the sale of the airport slots – which would be central to any bid for the business,” they add. Following the CAA decision the administrators had a two-week window in which to appeal, and the statement of proposals says they are intending to appeal to UK transport secretary Grant Shapps. While a number of parties have shown interest in Flybe's slots – the total value of which is uncertain – the administrators say they are yet to receive “any offers capable of acceptance” because of the current uncertainty in the airline market. “Administrators will continue to market the slots for sale, either through a group wide sale of the business or as a separate sale process,” they add. The situation will depend on the outcome of the CAA proceedings.",5,230,8.0,0.3505,"government, uk, carrier, business, state, share, south, airway, financial, plan","['uk', 'regional', 'carrier', 'flybe', 'administrator', 'intend', 'appeal', 'government', 'bid', 'retain', 'operating', 'licence', 'warn', 'sale', 'business', 'become', 'improbable', 'licence', 'revoke', 'flybe', 'cease', 'operation', 'march', 'voluntarily', 'suspend', 'operating', 'maintenance', 'licence', 'administrator', 'believe', 'goingconcern', 'sale', 'business', 'asset', 'may', 'possible', 'fully', 'explore', 'accord', 'statement', 'proposal', 'effort', 'result', 'interested', 'party', 'issue', 'information', 'memoranda', 'generate', 'submission', 'around', 'nonbinding', 'offer', 'party', 'interest', 'transaction', 'business', 'asset', 'although', 'necessarily', 'legal', 'entity', 'administrator', 'work', 'towards', 'receive', 'final', 'offer', 'evaluation', 'early', 'may', 'although', 'negotiation', 'continue', 'administrator', 'point', 'coronavirus', 'crisis', 'make', 'timeframe', 'complete', 'sale', 'challenge', 'owe', 'travel', 'restriction', 'capital', 'constraint', 'erode', 'valuation', 'diminish', 'bidder', 'appetite', 'flybe', 'operating', 'licence', 'potentially', 'present', 'another', 'obstacle', 'administrator', 'appeal', 'licence', 'revocation', 'notice', 'issue', 'immediately', 'carrier', 'cease', 'operation', 'matter', 'heard', 'civil', 'authority', 'panel', 'march', 'caa', 'rule', 'april', 'intend', 'support', 'revocation', 'argue', 'progress', 'acquisition', 'process', 'support', 'realistic', 'prospect', 'transaction', 'administrator', 'dispute', 'view', 'insist', 'maintain', 'licence', 'best', 'enable', 'achieve', 'sale', 'unlikely', 'business', 'sale', 'include', 'transfer', 'exist', 'employee', 'possible', 'operating', 'licence', 'revoke', 'since', 'prevents', 'sale', 'airport', 'slot', 'central', 'bid', 'business', 'add', 'follow', 'caa', 'decision', 'administrator', 'twoweek', 'window', 'appeal', 'statement', 'proposal', 'say', 'intend', 'appeal', 'uk', 'transport', 'secretary', 'grant', 'shapps', 'number', 'party', 'interest', 'flybe', 'slot', 'total', 'value', 'uncertain', 'administrator', 'say', 'yet', 'receive', 'offer', 'capable', 'acceptance', 'current', 'uncertainty', 'market', 'administrator', 'continue', 'market', 'slot', 'sale', 'either', 'wide', 'sale', 'business', 'separate', 'sale', 'process', 'add', 'situation', 'depend', 'outcome', 'caa', 'proceeding']"
"Travel restrictions imposed by the coronavirus outbreak resulted in around a third of completed Gulfstream business jets remaining undelivered in the first quarter, according to parent company General Dynamics. The constrained travel environment is also impacting sales of new aircraft due to the challenge of closing a deal, it says. On a 29 April first-quarter earnings call, General Dynamics chief executive Phebe Novakovic said the “biggest part of the story in the quarter” was Gulfstream's inability to deliver 13 completed aircraft due to coronavirus travel restrictions. The company had been scheduled to ship 34 aircraft in the three months ended 31 March - 27 large-cabin and seven midsize jets - matching output for the same period last year. To mitigate the impact, Novakovic says Gulfstream advanced two aircraft from deliveries planned for the second quarter into the first, “so net, we were down 11 scheduled deliveries” for the period, at 23 aircraft. Three units from the outstanding inventory were shipped in April, and a fourth will be handed over in May, while the remaining examples will be delivered when travel restrictions are lifted and ”people are happy to resume flying”, says Novakovic. “Customers definitely still want them, and they will be delivered as soon as we can,” she says. Lifting the travel restrictions should also “accelerate” sales activity at Gulfstream, Novakovic says. While interest in the business jet line-up remains robust, she says transactions are proving hard to close during the current climate. “It is difficult for our people to make in-person sales calls; we can't take customers on demonstration rides, and it is difficult to get folks together to work on contract issues,” says Novakovic. The coronavirus outbreak is also hitting Gulfstream production. Novakovic points to issues with the supply chain: “Some of our suppliers entered this crisis somewhat impaired both from exposure to the commercial aviation market and some financial difficulties,” she says. “The crisis exacerbated that and even before they were hit they were having some difficulty keeping up with our original production rate.” Novakovic also cites efficiency losses at Gulfstream's manufacturing and completion facilities due to “strict” social distancing and deep-cleaning measures. These factors have forced Gulfstream to revise its 2020 delivery forecast from the original plan of 150, down to 125-130 G650/ERs, G600s, G550s, G500s and G280s.

"Ryanair is expecting to cut up to 3,000 jobs from July and shut a number of European bases, as it projects that a post-crisis recovery will take at least two years. The airline is negotiating with Boeing to reduce planned deliveries of new 737s for the next 24 months, and is holding similar discussions with lessors of Laudamotion's Airbus A320 fleet. Ryanair says these measures will lower its capital expenditure commitments. The company is expecting a net loss of more than €100 million for the first quarter and further losses in the second. It adds that it needs to adjust to a “slower and more distorted” European air travel market once the coronavirus threat recedes.

It is embarking on a restructuring and job-reduction programme from July – subject to consultation – that will affect all airlines across the Ryanair Group.

"Textron Aviation's first-quarter profit tumbled 97% year-on-year to $3 million due largely to an idle factory floor and sagging aircraft sales amid the coronavirus pandemic. The Wichita-based airframer delivered 23 Cessna Citation jets in the first quarter, roughly half of the 44 jets delivered in the same period last year. Deliveries declined across the Citation line, with Textron handing over three M2s, three CJ3+, four CJ4s, two XLS+, seven Latitudes, two Sovereign+ and two of the company's flagship Longitudes.  Textron Aviation's Cessna Citation Longitude business jet. In the quarter, Textron delivered 16 commercial turboprops, including five Caravans and 11 King Airs. It delivered 44 commercial turboprops in the same quarter of 2019. “We did see several deliveries push out of the quarter resulting from customers' inability to accept aircraft due to Covid-19 travel restrictions,” says Textron chief executive Scott Donnelly. The airframer, a division of Providence-based Textron, generated $872 million in first-quarter revenue, down 23% year-on-year. “As government travel restrictions and other social distancing guidelines were implemented, we experienced a pause in sales activity, as face-to-face meetings and demonstration flights became increasingly difficult to conduct,” Donnelly says. “These actions led to the decline in retail order activity.” During the first quarter, the airframer temporarily shuttered manufacturing facilities and furloughed staff due to coronavirus. Textron has extended the still-ongoing shutdown and furloughs from four weeks to eight weeks. The value of Textron Aviation's backlog stood at $1.4 billion at the quarter's end, down from $2 billion one year earlier. A “revised demand outlook” by fractional aircraft customer NetJets pushed down the backlog value by some $290 million in the first quarter, Donnelly says.

"Carriers using Airbus A220s are being advised to monitor the operating performance of low-pressure compressors, to warn of stalls, following measures to address engine failures on the type. A220s are fitted with Pratt & Whitney PW1500G powerplants, which have been the subject of scrutiny following a series of engine failures involving Swiss and Air Baltic aircraft. Analysis has indicated that the low-pressure compressor's stage-one rotor was vulnerable to acoustic resonance, after a change to the vane schedule from a full-authority digital engine control software update. Operators have been instructed to revert to a previous vane schedule with revised software. But the US FAA says this can result in a lower stall margin for the compressor, resulting in deteriorated or dirty engines experiencing recoverable stalls at the top of climb. In a special bulletin, the FAA says two such stalls have occurred on the same PW1500G powerplant. While it says this concern does not warrant an airworthiness directive, it is recommending that A220 operators “continuously monitor” the operating performance of the low-pressure compressor. Pratt and Whitney has a method to monitor this performance, the FAA adds, which uses engine data provided by carriers, enabling the detection of deteriorated compressors before the onset of stalls.",5,235,6.0,0.4202,"engine, maintenance, fuel, takeoff, result, failure, system, problem, power, issue","['carrier', 'use', 'advise', 'monitor', 'operating', 'performance', 'lowpressure', 'compressor', 'warn', 'stall', 'follow', 'measure', 'address', 'engine', 'failure', 'type', 'fit', 'pratt', 'whitney', 'powerplants', 'subject', 'scrutiny', 'follow', 'series', 'engine', 'failure', 'involve', 'swiss', 'baltic', 'analysis', 'indicate', 'lowpressure', 'compressor', 'stageone', 'rotor', 'vulnerable', 'acoustic', 'resonance', 'change', 'vane', 'schedule', 'fullauthority', 'digital', 'engine', 'control', 'software', 'update', 'operator', 'instruct', 'revert', 'previous', 'vane', 'schedule', 'revise', 'software', 'u', 'faa', 'say', 'result', 'low', 'stall', 'margin', 'compressor', 'result', 'deteriorate', 'dirty', 'engine', 'experience', 'recoverable', 'stall', 'top', 'climb', 'special', 'bulletin', 'faa', 'say', 'stall', 'occur', 'powerplant', 'say', 'concern', 'warrant', 'airworthiness', 'directive', 'recommend', 'operator', 'continuously', 'monitor', 'operating', 'performance', 'lowpressure', 'compressor', 'pratt', 'whitney', 'method', 'monitor', 'performance', 'faa', 'add', 'engine', 'data', 'provide', 'carrier', 'enable', 'detection', 'deteriorate', 'compressor', 'onset', 'stall']"
"GE Aviation's commercial engine sales and orders tumbled in the first quarter of 2020, as did revenue and profit, as the coronavirus took a bite from the Ohio company's business. During the first quarter, the engine maker also received cancellations for 200 CFM International Leap-1B turbofans, which power the Boeing 737 Max. Boeing's customers have cancelled orders for hundreds of 737 Max in recent months, reflecting a broad industry downturn that has hammered GE's peers and airline customers. GE, which co-owns CFM with Safran Aircraft Engines, still turned a profit of $1.0 billion, down 39% year-on-year. First-quarter revenue slipped 13% from the same period last year to $6.9 billion, GE reports.  GE Aviation's products include the GE9X, seen here on the left wing of a Boeing 747 test aircraft. GE9X power Boeing's 777X. “Of all of our industrial segments, this business is feeling the impact of the pandemic most severely,” General Electric chief executive Larry Culp says of GE Aviation on 29 April. GE Aviation received orders valued at $7.4 billion in the quarter, down 14% year-on-year, with orders for new equipment such as engines sliding 31% and orders for services declining about 5%, the company reports. It sold 472 commercial engines in the first quarter, down 37% from 751 sales in the same period of 2019. First-quarter sales of Leap turbofans, which also power Airbus A320neo-family aircraft, slipped 36% year-on-year to 272 engines. GE received 145 commercial engine orders in the first quarter, down 82% from 799 orders in the first quarter last year. It landed only six Leap orders, down from 636 one year earlier. The engine maker has already responded to the coronavirus pandemic and subsequent aerospace downturn by slashing 10% of its US staff and furloughing half its US MRO and engine manufacturing workforce. “In the near term, we are right-sizing production capacity and actively managing the supply base,” says Culp.",4,236,0.0,0.413,"order, business, jet, delivery, production, customer, deliver, commercial, quarter, include","['ge', 'commercial', 'engine', 'sale', 'order', 'tumble', 'quarter', 'revenue', 'profit', 'coronavirus', 'take', 'bite', 'ohio', 'business', 'quarter', 'engine', 'maker', 'receive', 'cancellation', 'cfm', 'international', 'turbofan', 'power', 'customer', 'cancel', 'order', 'hundred', 'recent', 'month', 'reflect', 'broad', 'industry', 'downturn', 'hammer', 'ge', 'peer', 'customer', 'ge', 'coowns', 'cfm', 'safran', 'engine', 'still', 'turn', 'profit', 'yearonyear', 'firstquarter', 'revenue', 'slip', 'period', 'ge', 'report', 'ge', 'product', 'include', 'see', 'left', 'wing', 'test', 'power', 'industrial', 'segment', 'business', 'feel', 'impact', 'pandemic', 'severely', 'general', 'electric', 'chief', 'executive', 'larry', 'culp', 'say', 'ge', 'april', 'ge', 'receive', 'order', 'value', 'quarter', 'yearonyear', 'order', 'equipment', 'engine', 'slide', 'order', 'service', 'decline', 'report', 'sell', 'commercial', 'engine', 'quarter', 'sale', 'period', 'firstquarter', 'sale', 'leap', 'turbofan', 'power', 'slip', 'yearonyear', 'engine', 'ge', 'receive', 'commercial', 'engine', 'order', 'quarter', 'order', 'quarter', 'land', 'leap', 'order', 'earlier', 'engine', 'maker', 'already', 'respond', 'coronavirus', 'pandemic', 'subsequent', 'downturn', 'slash', 'u', 'staff', 'furlough', 'half', 'u', 'mro', 'engine', 'manufacturing', 'workforce', 'near', 'term', 'rightsizing', 'production', 'capacity', 'actively', 'manage', 'supply', 'base', 'say', 'culp']"
"South Africa's Comair is in “a very difficult financial position” due to coronavirus-related travel restrictions and does not anticipate being able to resume flights until October or November, the carrier has disclosed. In a 30 April cautionary announcement to shareholders, Comair writes: “Although the company was experiencing financial headwinds prior to the Covid-19 outbreak, the five-week lockdown has caused the situation to rapidly deteriorate to a point where the company finds itself in a very difficult financial position.” It advises shareholders to “exercise caution when dealing in the company's securities until a further announcement is made”. Comair says it has been “unable to operate” since 17 March and none of its business divisions have generated any revenues. Citing the South African government's plan to gradually ease lockdown restrictions, Comair says it does not expect to begin operating before October or November. The airline – which operates flights as a British Airways franchise carrier and under the Kululalow-cost brand – has taken a number of actions aimed at mitigating the impact of the lockdown on its finances. These include initiating plans to reduce the number of executives and other staff, terminating its planned acquisition of aircraft leasing specialist Star Air Cargo, and beginning negotiations with banks over a possible convertible loan note issuance. Comair incurred an operating loss of R562 million ($31 million) in the second half of 2019, which it attributed mainly to South African Airways' having gone into business rescue, saying the flag carrier owed it R790 million. Operating expenses in the six months ended 31 December increased 13% to R3.6 billion as a result of “significantly higher fleet and maintenance costs” and the Boeing 737 Max grounding.",4,237,8.0,0.2442,"government, uk, carrier, business, state, share, south, airway, financial, plan","['south', 'africa', 'comair', 'difficult', 'financial', 'position', 'due', 'coronavirusrelated', 'travel', 'restriction', 'anticipate', 'able', 'resume', 'october', 'november', 'carrier', 'disclose', 'april', 'cautionary', 'announcement', 'shareholder', 'comair', 'writes', 'although', 'experience', 'financial', 'headwind', 'prior', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'fiveweek', 'lockdown', 'cause', 'situation', 'rapidly', 'deteriorate', 'point', 'find', 'difficult', 'financial', 'advises', 'shareholder', 'exercise', 'caution', 'deal', 'security', 'far', 'announcement', 'make', 'comair', 'say', 'unable', 'operate', 'since', 'march', 'none', 'business', 'division', 'generate', 'revenue', 'cite', 'south', 'african', 'government', 'plan', 'gradually', 'ease', 'lockdown', 'restriction', 'comair', 'say', 'expect', 'begin', 'operating', 'october', 'november', 'operates', 'british', 'airway', 'franchise', 'carrier', 'kululalowcost', 'brand', 'take', 'number', 'action', 'aim', 'mitigate', 'impact', 'lockdown', 'finance', 'include', 'initiate', 'plan', 'reduce', 'number', 'executive', 'staff', 'terminate', 'plan', 'acquisition', 'lease', 'specialist', 'star', 'cargo', 'begin', 'negotiation', 'bank', 'possible', 'convertible', 'loan', 'note', 'issuance', 'comair', 'incur', 'operating', 'loss', 'second', 'half', 'attribute', 'mainly', 'south', 'african', 'airway', 'go', 'business', 'rescue', 'say', 'flag', 'carrier', 'owe', 'operating', 'expense', 'month', 'end', 'december', 'increase', 'result', 'significantly', 'high', 'fleet', 'maintenance', 'cost', 'ground']"
"Boeing is amending Boeing 747-400 flight manuals to clarify unreliable airspeed procedures after a British Airways crew erroneously believed a stall warning was genuine and repeatedly attempted a stall recovery manoeuvre. The aircraft (G-BNLN) had reached top-of-climb at 33,000ft, during a transatlantic service to Phoenix from London Heathrow on 9 June last year, when the crew received airspeed and altitude disagree alerts and an overspeed warning. Three pilots, among them a training captain, were in the cockpit. While the first officer carried out the unreliable airspeed recall drill, the other two pilots checked the quick-reference handbook to determine pitch and thrust requirements. But the aircraft's stick-shaker subsequently activated and the handbook – although noting that erroneous alerts could occur – did not specifically mention the stick-shaker. “[Boeing] considered that crews would understand this was included,” says the UK Air Accidents Investigation Branch. “It is apparent this was not, however, the case with the crew involved who considered they must react to the stall warning when it occurred.” The first officer reduced the pitch attitude to nose-down, and the stick-shaker ceased, but when he tried to achieve the handbook's pitch and power settings the warning recurred. He repeated this cycle several times, and the aircraft lost about 2,800ft during the manoeuvring before the settings were reached and the stick-shaker stopped. Investigators believe the fault lay with the right-hand air data computer but the problem could not be replicated during subsequent examination. The inquiry found, however, that the computer was vulnerable to a previously-identified periodic malfunction, which resulted in incorrect Mach number data being supplied to the stall-warning system, causing it to activate erroneously at a safe airspeed and angle-of-attack. Although a non-mandatory modification had been developed to overcome this malfunction, it had not been incorporated on G-BNLN. The 29-year old aircraft was retired from BA's fleet just two weeks later, on 24 June. Investigators state that the stick-shaker's ceasing when pitch reduced reinforced the crew's belief that its warning was genuine, especially since the handbook did not identify erroneous stick-shaker activation. “This highlights the importance of clear, unambiguous information being readily available to crews at times of high workload when dealing with potentially critical incidents,” says the inquiry. “It also reinforces the need for crews to understand the protection afforded by adopting the pitch and power settings provided as part of the procedure.” Boeing is planning to update the procedure in the 747 quick-reference handbook, from April 2020, to specifically include a reference to stall warnings, the inquiry adds, and is also considering similar action with other relevant aircraft types.",4,238,7.0,0.4438,"crew, runway, inquiry, land, approach, accident, investigator, captain, incident, pilot","['amend', 'manual', 'clarify', 'unreliable', 'airspeed', 'procedure', 'british', 'airway', 'crew', 'erroneously', 'believe', 'stall', 'warn', 'genuine', 'repeatedly', 'attempt', 'stall', 'recovery', 'manoeuvre', 'gbnln', 'reach', 'topofclimb', 'transatlantic', 'service', 'phoenix', 'london', 'heathrow', 'june', 'crew', 'receive', 'airspeed', 'altitude', 'disagree', 'alert', 'overspeed', 'warn', 'pilot', 'among', 'training', 'captain', 'cockpit', 'officer', 'carry', 'unreliable', 'airspeed', 'recall', 'drill', 'pilot', 'checked', 'quickreference', 'handbook', 'determine', 'pitch', 'thrust', 'requirement', 'stickshaker', 'subsequently', 'activate', 'handbook', 'although', 'note', 'erroneous', 'alert', 'occur', 'specifically', 'mention', 'stickshaker', 'consider', 'crew', 'understand', 'include', 'say', 'uk', 'accident', 'investigation', 'branch', 'apparent', 'however', 'case', 'crew', 'involve', 'consider', 'must', 'react', 'stall', 'warn', 'officer', 'reduce', 'pitch', 'attitude', 'nosedown', 'stickshaker', 'cease', 'try', 'achieve', 'handbook', 'pitch', 'power', 'setting', 'warn', 'recur', 'repeat', 'cycle', 'several', 'lose', 'manoeuvre', 'setting', 'reach', 'stickshaker', 'stop', 'investigator', 'believe', 'fault', 'lay', 'righthand', 'data', 'computer', 'problem', 'replicate', 'subsequent', 'examination', 'inquiry', 'found', 'however', 'computer', 'vulnerable', 'previouslyidentified', 'periodic', 'malfunction', 'result', 'incorrect', 'mach', 'number', 'data', 'supply', 'stallwarning', 'system', 'cause', 'activate', 'erroneously', 'safe', 'airspeed', 'angleofattack', 'although', 'nonmandatory', 'modification', 'developed', 'overcome', 'malfunction', 'incorporate', 'gbnln', 'old', 'retire', 'ba', 'fleet', 'week', 'later', 'june', 'investigator', 'state', 'stickshaker', 'cease', 'pitch', 'reduce', 'reinforce', 'crew', 'belief', 'warn', 'genuine', 'especially', 'since', 'handbook', 'identify', 'erroneous', 'stickshaker', 'activation', 'highlight', 'importance', 'clear', 'unambiguous', 'information', 'readily', 'available', 'crew', 'high', 'workload', 'deal', 'potentially', 'critical', 'incident', 'say', 'inquiry', 'reinforces', 'need', 'crew', 'understand', 'protection', 'afford', 'adopt', 'pitch', 'power', 'setting', 'provide', 'part', 'planning', 'update', 'procedure', 'quickreference', 'handbook', 'april', 'specifically', 'include', 'reference', 'stall', 'warning', 'inquiry', 'add', 'consider', 'similar', 'action', 'relevant', 'type']"
"Japan Airlines' net profit more than halved in the financial year ended 31 March, with coronavirus crisis cited as the overwhelming factor. “This is the unprecedentedly tremendous event risk ever for the airline industry and its end is not foreseeable at this moment. There is no question that theJALGroup has been significantly affected as well.” The group's operating revenue declined by 5.1% year-on-year, from Y1.49 trillion ($14 billion) to Y1.41 trillion. This largely comprises the international and domestic passenger segments, which declined by 10.3% and 2.6%, respectively. Operating expense was largely steady at Y1.31 trillion, and against that, operating profit nearly halved from Y176 billion to Y101 billion. Net profit slumped 64.6% to Y53.4 billion. As at 31 March, the group had Y329 billion in cash and cash equivalents, down from Y522 billion on 31 March 2019. Capacity onJAL's international network declined by 1.1% while revenue passenger kilometres (RPKs) were down 6.2%, pushing load factor down 4.2 percentage points to 77.1%. Weakness in the segment was attributed to lower Japan outbound demand, due to the global economic slowdown, while routes to Europe and China faced an industry-wide surplus, the company says. Geopolitical issues also impacted services to Hong Kong and South Korea. During the period, the group's domestic capacity gained 0.2% but against a 2.9% decline in RPKs, load factor fell by 2.2 percentage points to 70.3%. The carrier reports robust leisure and business demand, but the outbreak of Covid-19 led demand to fall rapidly from February onwards. The group states that it is actively expanding through codeshares and partnerships, while reiterating its commitment for long-haul, low-cost carrier subsidiary Zipair Tokyo to launch its first service in 2020. JALsays that current schedules amount to a 95% reduction on its international network, while domestic capacity has been cut by 70%. It has therefore deployed its passenger fleet on international and domestic cargo flights “to increase aircraft turnover and then profits”. Besides managing capacity to minimise operating cost,JALis looking at restructuring fixed costs and investments to minimise the impact on financial performance. It adds that proactively managing its financing allows it to secure cash on hand appropriately. The group did not provide a forecast for the next financial year as the pandemic remains uncertain. “There is possibility that the whole society, not only the airline industry, may change fundamentally,” it says. “However, the importance of global interaction of people and logistic network will not change.”",4,239,3.0,0.4045,"passenger, loss, operating, revenue, traffic, month, increase, capacity, decline, result","['japan', 'net', 'profit', 'halve', 'financial', 'end', 'march', 'coronavirus', 'crisis', 'cite', 'overwhelm', 'factor', 'unprecedentedly', 'tremendous', 'event', 'risk', 'ever', 'industry', 'end', 'foreseeable', 'moment', 'question', 'thejalgroup', 'significantly', 'affected', 'operating', 'revenue', 'decline', 'yearonyear', 'trillion', 'trillion', 'largely', 'comprises', 'international', 'domestic', 'passenger', 'segment', 'decline', 'respectively', 'operating', 'expense', 'largely', 'steady', 'trillion', 'operating', 'profit', 'nearly', 'halve', 'net', 'profit', 'slump', 'march', 'cash', 'cash', 'equivalent', 'march', 'capacity', 'onjal', 'international', 'network', 'decline', 'revenue', 'passenger', 'kilometre', 'rpks', 'push', 'load', 'factor', 'percentage', 'point', 'weakness', 'segment', 'attribute', 'low', 'japan', 'outbound', 'demand', 'due', 'global', 'economic', 'slowdown', 'route', 'europe', 'face', 'industrywide', 'surplus', 'say', 'geopolitical', 'issue', 'impact', 'service', 'hong', 'kong', 'south', 'korea', 'period', 'domestic', 'capacity', 'gain', 'decline', 'rpks', 'load', 'factor', 'fell', 'percentage', 'point', 'carrier', 'report', 'robust', 'leisure', 'business', 'demand', 'outbreak', 'coronavirus', 'lead', 'demand', 'fall', 'rapidly', 'february', 'onwards', 'state', 'actively', 'expand', 'codeshares', 'partnership', 'reiterate', 'commitment', 'longhaul', 'lowcost', 'carrier', 'subsidiary', 'zipair', 'tokyo', 'launch', 'service', 'jalsays', 'current', 'schedule', 'amount', 'reduction', 'international', 'network', 'domestic', 'capacity', 'cut', 'therefore', 'deployed', 'passenger', 'fleet', 'international', 'domestic', 'cargo', 'increase', 'turnover', 'profit', 'besides', 'manage', 'capacity', 'minimise', 'operating', 'cost', 'jalis', 'look', 'restructuring', 'fix', 'cost', 'investment', 'minimise', 'impact', 'financial', 'performance', 'add', 'proactively', 'manage', 'financing', 'allows', 'secure', 'cash', 'hand', 'appropriately', 'provide', 'forecast', 'next', 'financial', 'pandemic', 'remains', 'uncertain', 'possibility', 'whole', 'society', 'industry', 'may', 'change', 'fundamentally', 'say', 'however', 'importance', 'global', 'interaction', 'people', 'logistic', 'network', 'change']"
"Airline and airport bodies have warned the Argentine authorities about the 'imminent and substantial risk' of its to move to suspend air travel in the country until the start of September. While air travel restrictions are in place - and have been extended - across a series of countries around the world, Argentina has gone further by expanding the restrictions until September. Speaking during a media briefing on 28 April, IATA director general Alexandre de Juniac said Argentina is effectively grounding commercial aviation until 1 September. “That is well beyond the current period of lockdown in the country and will risk additional thousands of jobs connected to the travel and tourism sector,” he says. ”We don't dispute the government's decision to lock down. But why set an arbitrary date for aviation that is not based on science or aligned with what is being planned for the rest of the economy?” In a joint statement the Latin American and Caribbean Air Transport Association (ALTA), IATA and Airports Council International say the decision directly impacts the entire airline industry in Argentina and the region. ”The survival risk that airlines will face under this resolution endangers thousands of jobs in the country, Argentina's connectivity with the world, as well as internal connectivity that is vital for the transportation of essential supplies and for economic and social well-being of the nation,” the associations say. They also note that the country's airports must remain open during this period to handle cargo and humanitarian flights, but will miss out on commercial passenger flights which represents 80% of its revenues. The associations note that the airline industry is working with ICAO to develop an air traffic recovery plan in line with World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. ”We are facing a highly complex scenario, in which around 50% of the fixed costs of the airlines remain intact and also do not currently receive any income,” the associations says. ”Unfortunately, many companies in the sector will not be able to survive if this resolution is implemented as planned.”",4,240,12.0,0.2639,"travel, government, country, coronavirus, measure, restriction, passenger, state, march, canada","['airport', 'body', 'warn', 'argentine', 'authority', 'substantial', 'risk', 'move', 'suspend', 'travel', 'country', 'start', 'september', 'travel', 'restriction', 'place', 'extend', 'across', 'series', 'country', 'around', 'world', 'argentina', 'go', 'far', 'expand', 'restriction', 'september', 'speak', 'medium', 'briefing', 'april', 'iata', 'director', 'general', 'alexandre', 'de', 'juniac', 'say', 'argentina', 'effectively', 'ground', 'commercial', 'september', 'well', 'beyond', 'current', 'period', 'lockdown', 'country', 'risk', 'additional', 'thousand', 'job', 'connect', 'travel', 'tourism', 'sector', 'say', 'dispute', 'government', 'decision', 'lock', 'set', 'arbitrary', 'date', 'base', 'science', 'align', 'plan', 'rest', 'economy', 'joint', 'statement', 'latin', 'american', 'caribbean', 'transport', 'association', 'alta', 'iata', 'airport', 'council', 'international', 'say', 'decision', 'directly', 'impact', 'entire', 'industry', 'argentina', 'region', 'survival', 'risk', 'face', 'resolution', 'endangers', 'thousand', 'job', 'country', 'argentina', 'connectivity', 'world', 'well', 'internal', 'connectivity', 'vital', 'transportation', 'essential', 'supply', 'economic', 'social', 'wellbeing', 'nation', 'association', 'say', 'note', 'country', 'airport', 'must', 'remain', 'open', 'period', 'handle', 'cargo', 'humanitarian', 'miss', 'commercial', 'passenger', 'represent', 'revenue', 'association', 'note', 'industry', 'work', 'icao', 'develop', 'traffic', 'recovery', 'plan', 'line', 'world', 'health', 'organization', 'guideline', 'face', 'highly', 'complex', 'scenario', 'around', 'fix', 'cost', 'remain', 'intact', 'currently', 'receive', 'income', 'association', 'say', 'unfortunately', 'many', 'sector', 'able', 'survive', 'resolution', 'implement', 'plan']"
"Cebu Pacific posted an operating loss of Ps693 million ($13.7 million) in the first quarter of 2020, reversing the Ps3.85 billion operating profit made in the same period last year. Total revenue for the quarter ended 31 March fell 24.9% to Ps15.9 billion, as revenue from passenger, cargo, and ancillary segments fell across the board. The low-cost carrier's expenses declined 4.2% to Ps16.6 billion, due to a sharp fall in costs associated with reduced flying operations, as well as reservation and sales. On the other hand, costs from depreciation and amortisation, and aircraft maintenance costs were all higher. Cebu Pacific thus slipped into a net loss of Ps1.18 billion, down from a net profit of Ps4 billion last year. Factors contributing to the net loss include losses from hedging and foreign exchange. Cash and cash equivalent stood at Ps17.5 billion as of 31 March, down from the Ps22.5 billion a year before.

"The AirAsia Group is “relooking” its orders for Airbus aircraft, as it gears up for return to service across its various networks. The airline group also confirmed that it will not be taking delivery of any new aircraft for the rest of the year, and targets a fleet size of 242 aircraft by year-end. This is a net reduction of one aircraft from end-2019, AirAsia Group executive chairman Kamarudin Meranun says. Cirium fleets data indicates AirAsia has more than 350 A320neo family aircraft on order, the bulk of them A321neos. Long-haul subsidiary AirAsia X also has close to 80 A330neos on order. The group's earlier estimates indicate that AirAsia and AirAsia X were due to receive 14 aircraft in 2020, and a further 29 aircraft in 2021. Kamarudin, who stopped short of providing more details on its discussions with Airbus, notes that “the decision to sell and lease our aircraft in late 2018, has provided us greater flexibility to scale back growth than owning aircraft today”. The group has also restructured “a major portion of the fuel hedges” in a bid to cut down hedging losses should fuel prices remain at its current lows. “Further measures in managing and containing cost include both the management and senior employees of AirAsia Group volunteering a salary sacrifice, re-negotiating contracts and deferring all non-essential expenditures,” says Kamarudin. Taken together, the measures should help shave 30% off the year's costs, he adds. In early April, group chief executive Tony Fernandes made similar comments on aircraft deliveries. During an interview on Bloomberg TV, Fernandes expressed skepticism about airlines taking delivery of aircraft anytime soon. “It's hard to be talking about new aircraft right now when demand is what it is, but we'll have to see. No airline is talking about growth right now. It's about hunkering down, being positive, and bouncing back when the lockdowns come out and we begin to beat this virus, which will eventually happen,” he said. Nearly all of the AirAsia group carriers have had to suspend their operations in April through May as a result of travel restrictions and falling demand from the coronavirus outbreak. Malaysia's AirAsia will restart scheduled domestic service on 29 April, with the group's other subsidiaries in Thailand, the Philippines and Indonesia gradually reinstating service through May. “The resumption of services will initially be for key selected domestic routes, which will increase gradually to include international destinations around the region, once the situation improves and governments lift borders and travel restrictions,” the group states.",4,242,10.0,0.1491,"international, authority, civil, state, investigation, case, add, january, airasia, crash","['airasia', 'relooking', 'order', 'gear', 'return', 'service', 'across', 'various', 'network', 'confirm', 'take', 'delivery', 'rest', 'target', 'fleet', 'size', 'yearend', 'net', 'reduction', 'airasia', 'executive', 'chairman', 'kamarudin', 'meranun', 'say', 'fleet', 'data', 'indicates', 'airasia', 'family', 'order', 'bulk', 'longhaul', 'subsidiary', 'airasia', 'x', 'close', 'order', 'earlier', 'estimate', 'indicate', 'airasia', 'airasia', 'x', 'due', 'receive', 'far', 'kamarudin', 'stop', 'short', 'provide', 'detail', 'discussion', 'note', 'decision', 'sell', 'lease', 'late', 'provide', 'u', 'great', 'flexibility', 'scale', 'back', 'growth', 'today', 'restructure', 'major', 'portion', 'fuel', 'hedge', 'bid', 'cut', 'hedge', 'loss', 'fuel', 'price', 'remain', 'current', 'low', 'far', 'measure', 'manage', 'contain', 'cost', 'include', 'management', 'senior', 'employee', 'airasia', 'volunteer', 'salary', 'sacrifice', 'renegotiate', 'contract', 'defer', 'nonessential', 'expenditure', 'say', 'kamarudin', 'take', 'together', 'measure', 'help', 'shave', 'cost', 'add', 'early', 'april', 'chief', 'executive', 'tony', 'fernandes', 'make', 'similar', 'comment', 'delivery', 'interview', 'bloomberg', 'tv', 'fernandes', 'express', 'skepticism', 'take', 'delivery', 'anytime', 'soon', 'hard', 'talk', 'right', 'demand', 'see', 'talk', 'growth', 'right', 'hunker', 'positive', 'bounce', 'back', 'lockdown', 'come', 'begin', 'beat', 'virus', 'eventually', 'happen', 'say', 'nearly', 'airasia', 'carrier', 'suspend', 'operation', 'april', 'may', 'result', 'travel', 'restriction', 'fall', 'demand', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'malaysia', 'airasia', 'restart', 'schedule', 'domestic', 'service', 'april', 'subsidiary', 'thailand', 'philippine', 'indonesia', 'gradually', 'reinstate', 'service', 'may', 'resumption', 'service', 'initially', 'key', 'select', 'domestic', 'route', 'increase', 'gradually', 'include', 'international', 'destination', 'around', 'region', 'situation', 'improves', 'government', 'lift', 'border', 'travel', 'restriction', 'state']"
"China's three largest carriers have warned of deeper financial impact from the coronavirus outbreak, as they each swung to significant first-quarter losses. Air China, China Southern Airlines and China Eastern Airlines all warned of “adverse” and “severe” impact on their first-half financial results, pointing towards “uncertainty” in the development of the pandemic. China Southern notes that while demand for domestic air travel has “recovered to a certain extent” as a result of the Chinese government's measures to control the outbreak, international passenger traffic is still in the doldrums, given the growing list of travel restrictions. Echoing these sentiments, compatriot China Eastern states: “[There] is still great uncertainty in the time span and severity of the epidemic around the world, which may magnify the impact on or result in a delay in the recovery of travel demand.” Their grave warnings come as each reported their financial results for the quarter ended 31 March. China was where the coronavirus outbreak originated in late December 2019, and from January was the subject of a growing list of global travel bans. For the period, each carrier saw revenue nearly halved on the back of falling travel demand. Of the three carriers, China Southern fared the worst, posting an operating loss of CNY7.73 billion ($1.09 billion). This contrasts with the CNY3.55 billion profit it reported for the same period in 2019. Revenue fell 43.8% to CNY21.1 billion, while expenses dropped 16.6% to CNY28.9 billion. The carrier reported an attributable net loss of CNY5.3 billion for the period. China Eastern, meanwhile, posted an operating loss of CNY5.69 billion, reversing its operating profit of CNY2.8 billion for the year-ago period. Revenue shrank 48.6% year-on-year to CNY15.5 billion, while expenses decreased 28.2% to CNY18.5 billion. The Shanghai-based carrier's attributable net loss for the period came in at CNY3.93 billion, compared to a net profit of CNY2 billion in 2019. Air China reported an operating loss of CNY6.79 billion. For the same period in 2019, it posted an operating profit of CNY3.98 billion. The carrier saw revenues plummet 47% year-on-year to CNY17.3 billion, while expenses fell nearly 20% to CNY23.8 billion. It reported an attributable net loss of CNY4.8 billion for the period.

"Boeing added a $168 million charge to its development of the US Air Force's (USAF) VC-25B presidential transport due to disruptions to its engineering process caused by coronavirus. That is the first loss Boeing has recorded on the programme. The company is on contract to produce two 747-8-based executive transports to replace the USAF's older two 747-200B-based VC-25As. The VC-25A is popularly known by its “Air Force One” call sign when the president of the USA flies aboard. “The reach-forward loss on VC-25B is associated with engineering inefficiencies from the Covid-19 environment,” says Boeing in its first quarter financial filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. “We believe these inefficiencies will result in staffing challenges, schedule inefficiencies and higher costs in the upcoming phases of the programme.” The company might be able to recover some of the loss via provisions of the aerospace bailout package, the Cares Act, says Boeing chief financial officer Greg Smith on a first quarter 2020 earnings call on 29 April. The loss and hint of likely delays differs sharply from a rosy assessment of the programme given two weeks ago by Will Roper, assistant secretary of the USAF for acquisition technology and logistics. He said that the programme would pass its critical design review using video conferences. In fact, the VC-25B programme was supposed to benefit from the coronavirus, Roper said on 16 April. “A lot of the engineers, tools and talent that would be dedicated to other commercial functions within Boeing have now been available to help that programme,” he said, noting the company's commercial aircraft production is idled. “I don't see any slips right now [in schedule] for VC-25B because of Covid-19.” Roper declined to comment on the programme saying that he had just learned of the issues.",4,244,1.0,0.2233,"test, force, helicopter, fire, system, service, attack, design, usaf, missile","['add', 'charge', 'development', 'u', 'force', 'usaf', 'presidential', 'transport', 'due', 'disruption', 'engineering', 'process', 'cause', 'coronavirus', 'loss', 'record', 'programme', 'contract', 'produce', 'executive', 'transport', 'replace', 'usaf', 'old', 'popularly', 'know', 'force', 'call', 'sign', 'president', 'usa', 'fly', 'aboard', 'reachforward', 'loss', 'associate', 'engineering', 'inefficiency', 'coronavirus', 'environment', 'say', 'quarter', 'financial', 'filing', 'security', 'exchange', 'commission', 'believe', 'inefficiency', 'result', 'staff', 'challenge', 'schedule', 'inefficiency', 'high', 'cost', 'upcoming', 'phase', 'might', 'able', 'recover', 'loss', 'via', 'provision', 'bailout', 'package', 'care', 'act', 'say', 'chief', 'financial', 'officer', 'greg', 'smith', 'quarter', 'earnings', 'call', 'april', 'loss', 'hint', 'likely', 'delay', 'differs', 'sharply', 'rosy', 'assessment', 'programme', 'give', 'week', 'ago', 'roper', 'assistant', 'secretary', 'usaf', 'acquisition', 'technology', 'logistics', 'say', 'programme', 'pas', 'critical', 'design', 'review', 'use', 'video', 'conference', 'fact', 'programme', 'suppose', 'benefit', 'coronavirus', 'roper', 'say', 'april', 'lot', 'engineer', 'tool', 'talent', 'dedicate', 'commercial', 'function', 'within', 'available', 'help', 'programme', 'say', 'note', 'commercial', 'production', 'idle', 'see', 'slip', 'right', 'schedule', 'roper', 'decline', 'comment', 'programme', 'say', 'learn', 'issue']"
"It will cost Boeing $551 million to redesign the boom camera on the KC-46A Pegasus in-flight refuelling tanker. In total, the aerospace company took a pre-tax charge of $827 million for the KC-46A tanker in the first quarter of 2020, it says in an earnings call on 29 April. In addition to the boom camera redesign, the programme lost money because of “productivity inefficiencies” and coronavirus-caused shutdowns of Boeing's Puget Sound factories where the KC-46A is made, the company says. Total losses on the KC-46A programme have now risen to about $4.6 billion. The tanker charge caused Boeing's Defense, Space & Security business to lose $191 million from operations in the first quarter of 2020. In the first quarter of 2019, the company earned $852 million from operations. Boeing signed an agreement with the US Air Force (USAF) in April to develop and install a new boom camera, called the Remote Vision System (RVS), on the KC-46A. As part of that agreement, the service decided to release $882 million in payments withheld for a variety of problems with the KC-46A in order to shore up Boeing's cash flow. The KC-46A programme has been plagued by problems that have delayed delivery of aircraft and hurt its operational readiness. Issues have included foreign object debris found inside the tanker's airframe, malfunctioning cargo locks and leaky fuel tanks, as well as problems with images produced by the RVS warping or washing out on boom operator video screens. The USAF has withheld 20% of payments on examples of the KC-46A that Boeing delivered to the service because those aircraft do not meet agreed specifications. The programme has three category-one deficiencies, such as the issue with the RVS, and a number of other smaller problems. Category-one deficiencies are problems “which may cause death or severe injury; may cause loss or major damage to a weapon system; critically restricts the combat readiness capabilities of the using organisation; or results in a production line stoppage”, the USAF has said. With losses on the KC-46A programme already piled high, Boeing is hoping to make up the deficit with sales to foreign militaries. International customers have been slow to buy the tanker, but Boeing notched an important win in March when Israel was approved to buy eight examples of the aircraft for an estimated $2.4 billion. Prior to that only Japan had agreed to buy the KC-46A, with just two aircraft on contract.",4,245,1.0,0.3566,"test, force, helicopter, fire, system, service, attack, design, usaf, missile","['cost', 'redesign', 'boom', 'camera', 'pegasus', 'inflight', 'refuel', 'tanker', 'total', 'take', 'pretax', 'charge', 'tanker', 'quarter', 'say', 'earnings', 'call', 'april', 'addition', 'boom', 'camera', 'redesign', 'programme', 'lose', 'money', 'productivity', 'inefficiency', 'coronaviruscaused', 'shutdown', 'puget', 'sound', 'factory', 'make', 'say', 'total', 'loss', 'programme', 'risen', 'tanker', 'charge', 'cause', 'defense', 'space', 'security', 'business', 'lose', 'operation', 'quarter', 'quarter', 'earn', 'operation', 'sign', 'agreement', 'u', 'force', 'usaf', 'april', 'develop', 'install', 'boom', 'camera', 'call', 'remote', 'vision', 'system', 'rv', 'part', 'agreement', 'service', 'decide', 'release', 'payment', 'withheld', 'variety', 'problem', 'order', 'shore', 'cash', 'flow', 'programme', 'plague', 'problem', 'delayed', 'delivery', 'hurt', 'operational', 'readiness', 'issue', 'include', 'foreign', 'object', 'debris', 'found', 'inside', 'tanker', 'airframe', 'malfunction', 'cargo', 'lock', 'leaky', 'fuel', 'tank', 'well', 'problem', 'image', 'produce', 'rv', 'warp', 'wash', 'boom', 'operator', 'video', 'screen', 'usaf', 'withheld', 'payment', 'example', 'deliver', 'service', 'meet', 'agree', 'specification', 'programme', 'categoryone', 'deficiency', 'issue', 'rv', 'number', 'small', 'problem', 'categoryone', 'deficiency', 'problem', 'may', 'cause', 'death', 'severe', 'injury', 'may', 'cause', 'loss', 'major', 'damage', 'weapon', 'system', 'critically', 'restricts', 'combat', 'readiness', 'capability', 'use', 'organisation', 'result', 'production', 'line', 'stoppage', 'usaf', 'say', 'loss', 'programme', 'already', 'pile', 'high', 'hop', 'make', 'deficit', 'sale', 'foreign', 'military', 'international', 'customer', 'slow', 'buy', 'tanker', 'notch', 'important', 'win', 'march', 'israel', 'approve', 'buy', 'example', 'estimate', 'prior', 'japan', 'agree', 'buy', 'contract']"
"Boeing has no immediate plan to restructure its 787 manufacturing footprint despite announcing a major cut in production. However, chief executive David Calhoun says Boeing will have time to review its manufacturing strategy in the coming years, as 787 production further declines. The company on 29 April announced it will reduce 787 production from 14 aircraft monthly to 10 monthly this year, and then to seven jets monthly by 2022.  A Korean Air 787-9 and 787-10 Previously, Boeing planned to cut production to 10 aircraft monthly next year but to increase the rate to 12 monthly in 2023. Boeing produces 787s at sites in Everett, Washington, and North Charleston, South Carolina. “Certainty, both lines will be running” during the initial phase of reducing production to 10 787s monthly, Calhoun says. “We haven't made any decision on the 787...production locations,” he adds of production requirements after 2020. “We will have plenty of time to figure out exactly the way to go.” The latest production par back reflects the coronavirus downturn, which has hammered demand for commercial aircraft, especially for widebody jets. Also on 29 April, Boeing announced it is cutting its workforce by 10%, or roughly 16,000 staff, due to the coronavirus downturn. Staff cuts in Boeing's commercial aircraft operation, including its services businesses, could top 15%, Boeing said. The company also plans to reduce the production of the 777 and in-development 777X to three aircraft monthly in 2021. Boeing expects to deliver the first 777X next year.",4,246,0.0,0.4061,"order, business, jet, delivery, production, customer, deliver, commercial, quarter, include","['immediate', 'plan', 'restructure', 'manufacturing', 'footprint', 'despite', 'announce', 'major', 'cut', 'production', 'however', 'chief', 'executive', 'david', 'calhoun', 'say', 'review', 'manufacturing', 'strategy', 'come', 'production', 'far', 'decline', 'april', 'announce', 'reduce', 'production', 'monthly', 'monthly', 'jet', 'monthly', 'korean', 'previously', 'plan', 'cut', 'production', 'monthly', 'next', 'increase', 'rate', 'monthly', 'produce', 'site', 'everett', 'washington', 'north', 'charleston', 'south', 'carolina', 'certainty', 'line', 'run', 'initial', 'phase', 'reduce', 'production', 'monthly', 'calhoun', 'say', 'make', 'decision', 'production', 'location', 'add', 'production', 'requirement', 'plenty', 'figure', 'exactly', 'way', 'late', 'production', 'par', 'back', 'reflect', 'coronavirus', 'downturn', 'hammer', 'demand', 'commercial', 'especially', 'widebody', 'jet', 'april', 'announce', 'cut', 'workforce', 'roughly', 'staff', 'due', 'coronavirus', 'downturn', 'staff', 'cut', 'commercial', 'operation', 'include', 'service', 'business', 'top', 'say', 'plan', 'reduce', 'production', 'indevelopment', 'monthly', 'expect', 'deliver', 'next']"
"Figures from IATA for March show global airline passenger traffic already down by more than 50% and collective load factors falling in excess of 20 percentage points in a further illustration of how sharply the coronavirus crisis has hit the sector. While February figures had shown a 14% fall in global airline passenger traffic, this was driven almost entirely by a sharp downturn in Asia-Pacific airline traffic. Africa was the only other region that month to report a fall, albeit only fractional.  But figures for March, released by the trade association today, show passenger traffic sharply down across all regions compared with the same month in 2019 as the pandemic spread across the globe - prompting a slew of travel restrictions and national lockdowns. Carriers in Asia-Pacific again were the hardest hit. IATA figures show airline traffic among Asia-Pacific operators slumping just shy of 60%. This far outstripped the 44% cut in capacity, resulting in a 21.4 percentage point fall in passenger load factors to 58.9%. This slump was even more pronounced on international routes, where Asia-Pacific carriers saw traffic slump 65% and load factors tumbled by 23.4 points. While traffic was down 65% in the Chinese domestic market - the second biggest in the world - in March, this marked an improvement on the 85% fall in February. This reflects the gradual re-opening of the Chinese market, which had been the first impacted by the coronavirus outbreak. Asia-Pacific carriers account for the largest regional share of global traffic, just over a third of all RPKs in March. Airlines from Europe, the region accounting for the second biggest share of RPKs, also endured a fall of more than half of traffic. Total European traffic fell 52%, again far out-pacing the cuts in capacity over the same period. As a result, European airline load factors slumped almost 17 points to 67%. Traffic among North American carriers was also down by roughly half in March compared with the previous year. As capacity was cut by less than quarter - the smallest percentage reduction of any region -  carriers in North America logged an almost 30 point slump in load factor to 55.7%. That in part reflects relatively light capacity reductions in domestic capacity in March. North American domestic traffic was 48% down on capacity cut only 14%. This resulted in a near 34 point fall in domestic load factors. Asia-Pacific, European and North American carriers account for almost 84% of global passenger traffic. “March was a disastrous month for aviation,” says IATA director general Alexandre de Juniac. ”Airlines progressively felt the growing impact of the COVID-19 related border closings and restrictions on mobility, including in domestic markets. ”Demand was at the same level it was in 2006 but we have the fleets and employees for double that. Worse, we know that the situation deteriorated even more in April and most signs point to a slow recovery,” he adds. While traffic and load factor falls were lower in the three other regions, they were still all sharply down. Traffic among Middle East operators was down 46% on capacity cut nearly 34%, leading to a 13.5 point fall in load factors. African operators recorded an 11 point fall in load factors as traffic fell 44.5%, while traffic among Latin American carriers was 39% lower and its load factors 13.5 points down. IATA has already estimated global passenger traffic in 2020 will be down 48% on the 2019 figure. It expects this to translate into a $314 billion loss in passenger revenues.",4,247,3.0,0.4761,"passenger, loss, operating, revenue, traffic, month, increase, capacity, decline, result","['figure', 'iata', 'march', 'global', 'passenger', 'traffic', 'already', 'collective', 'load', 'factor', 'fall', 'excess', 'percentage', 'point', 'far', 'illustration', 'sharply', 'coronavirus', 'crisis', 'hit', 'sector', 'february', 'figure', 'fall', 'global', 'passenger', 'traffic', 'driven', 'almost', 'entirely', 'sharp', 'downturn', 'asiapacific', 'traffic', 'africa', 'region', 'month', 'report', 'fall', 'albeit', 'fractional', 'figure', 'march', 'release', 'trade', 'association', 'today', 'passenger', 'traffic', 'sharply', 'across', 'region', 'compare', 'month', 'pandemic', 'spread', 'across', 'globe', 'prompt', 'slew', 'travel', 'restriction', 'national', 'lockdown', 'carrier', 'asiapacific', 'hardest', 'hit', 'iata', 'figure', 'traffic', 'among', 'asiapacific', 'operator', 'slump', 'shy', 'far', 'outstrip', 'cut', 'capacity', 'result', 'percentage', 'point', 'fall', 'passenger', 'load', 'factor', 'slump', 'even', 'pronounce', 'international', 'route', 'asiapacific', 'carrier', 'saw', 'traffic', 'slump', 'load', 'factor', 'tumble', 'point', 'traffic', 'chinese', 'domestic', 'market', 'second', 'big', 'world', 'march', 'marked', 'improvement', 'fall', 'february', 'reflect', 'gradual', 'reopen', 'chinese', 'market', 'impact', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'asiapacific', 'carrier', 'account', 'large', 'regional', 'share', 'global', 'traffic', 'third', 'rpks', 'march', 'europe', 'region', 'accounting', 'second', 'big', 'share', 'rpks', 'endure', 'fall', 'half', 'traffic', 'total', 'european', 'traffic', 'fell', 'far', 'outpace', 'cut', 'capacity', 'period', 'result', 'european', 'load', 'factor', 'slump', 'almost', 'point', 'traffic', 'among', 'north', 'american', 'carrier', 'roughly', 'half', 'march', 'compare', 'previous', 'capacity', 'cut', 'less', 'quarter', 'small', 'percentage', 'reduction', 'region', 'carrier', 'north', 'america', 'log', 'almost', 'point', 'slump', 'load', 'factor', 'part', 'reflect', 'relatively', 'light', 'capacity', 'reduction', 'domestic', 'capacity', 'march', 'north', 'american', 'domestic', 'traffic', 'capacity', 'cut', 'result', 'near', 'point', 'fall', 'domestic', 'load', 'factor', 'asiapacific', 'european', 'north', 'american', 'carrier', 'account', 'almost', 'global', 'passenger', 'traffic', 'march', 'disastrous', 'month', 'say', 'iata', 'director', 'general', 'alexandre', 'de', 'juniac', 'progressively', 'felt', 'grow', 'impact', 'coronavirus', 'related', 'border', 'closing', 'restriction', 'mobility', 'include', 'domestic', 'market', 'demand', 'level', 'fleet', 'employee', 'double', 'bad', 'know', 'situation', 'deteriorate', 'even', 'april', 'sign', 'point', 'slow', 'recovery', 'add', 'traffic', 'load', 'factor', 'fall', 'low', 'region', 'still', 'sharply', 'traffic', 'among', 'middle', 'east', 'operator', 'capacity', 'cut', 'nearly', 'lead', 'point', 'fall', 'load', 'factor', 'african', 'operator', 'record', 'point', 'fall', 'load', 'factor', 'traffic', 'fell', 'traffic', 'among', 'latin', 'american', 'carrier', 'low', 'load', 'factor', 'point', 'iata', 'already', 'estimate', 'global', 'passenger', 'traffic', 'figure', 'expect', 'translate', 'loss', 'passenger', 'revenue']"
"Boeing is slashing its commercial aircraft workforce by more than 15% and cutting production rates in response to the coronavirus pandemic and ensuing cash crunch. The airframer announced the cuts as it reported losses of $641 million in the first quarter of 2020. “These new reductions in our production rates and the continued impact of Covid-19 on our business will force us to reduce the size of our workforce. I'm sorry that I have to deliver this news,” Boeing chief executive David Calhoun says in a letter to staff. Chicago-headquartered Boeing will cut total employment by about 10% through layoffs, voluntary departures and normal staff turnover, the letter says. Boeing has some 160,000 staff, meaning about 16,000 jobs will be cut. “We'll have to make even deeper reductions in areas that are most exposed to the condition of our commercial customers – more than 15% across our commercial airplanes and services businesses, as well as our corporate functions,” says Calhoun. He notes Boeing is also shrinking the size of its executive management team. Production of the still-grounded 737 Max will resume “at low rates in 2020” and “gradually increase to 31 per month during 2021, with further gradual increases to correspond with market demand”, says Boeing. The lower output adds $1 billion to the cost of the Max production upheaval, bringing Boeing's estimated total cost of the Max's “abnormal” production to $5 billion, Boeing says. Boeing had been making 53 Max monthly when regulators grounded the type in March 2019. The company will also cut 787 output to 10 aircraft per month this year, down from 14 currently, falling to seven aircraft monthly by 2022. Under a previous plan, Boeing intended to reduce 787 production to 10 monthly in 2021, but then increase that to 12 per month in 2023. Additionally, Boeing will reduce monthly combined 777/777X output to three aircraft monthly in 2021 and will “take a measured approach to the 777X rate ramp”. Boeing currently builds five 777s monthly and expects to begin delivering the 777X in 2021. The airframer has not adjusted output of the 767 or 747, currently at respective rates of 2.5 and 0.5 per month. “The global pandemic has changed the way we live and work. It is changing our industry. We are facing utterly unexpected challenges,” Calhoun says. “Airlines are delaying purchases [of] new jets, putting the brakes on delivery schedules and deferring elective maintenance,” he adds. “We're also seeing a dramatic impact on our commercial services business, as grounded airline fleets decrease the demand for our offerings.” The company's operations burned $4.3 billion during the first quarter. But Boeing started the period with $9.5 billion in cash, took a roughly $14 billion loan in the quarter and ended March with cash of $15 billion, meaning it actually used more than $8 billion in cash during the first quarter, notes Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Ronald Epstein. That $8 billion includes the operations cash burn and repayment of debt or financing, Epstein says. “Access to additional liquidity will be critical for Boeing and the aerospace manufacturing sector to bridge to recovery, and the company is actively exploring all of the available options. Boeing believes it will be able to obtain sufficient liquidity to fund its operations,” Boeing says. The company has said it is considering applying for government aid through a coronavirus relief package. Boeing notes steps recently taken to shore up its finances: drawing a term loan of $13.8 billion, cutting operating costs, halting stock repurchases and dividend payments, and reducing research and development expenses. Boeing's first quarter revenue declined 26% year on year to $16.9 billion, while costs slipped about 10%, to $16.8 billion. “While Covid-19 is adding unprecedented pressure to our business, we remain confident in our long-term future,” says Calhoun. “We continue to support our defence customers in their critical national security missions. We are progressing toward the safe return to service of the 737 Max, and we are driving safety, quality and operational excellence into all that we do every day. Air travel has always been resilient.” The coronavirus and Max grounding particularly hammered Boeing Commercial Airplanes. That unit lost $2.1 billion in the first quarter, reversing a $1.2 billion profit in the same period last year. Commercial aircraft revenue declined roughly half to $6.2 billion, and Boeing delivered only 50 commercial aircraft in the period, down from 149 in the first quarter of 2019, it says. First quarter expenses included $797 million from the pre-coronavirus Max production suspension, $336 million to address issues with 737NG hardware, and $137 million from suspension of Seattle-area production amid the coronavirus pandemic. The company also reports lower 787 margins. Boeing Global Services' revenue remained largely flat year on year at $4.6 billion, although the unit's profit increased by 8%, to $708 billion.",4,248,0.0,0.294,"order, business, jet, delivery, production, customer, deliver, commercial, quarter, include","['slash', 'commercial', 'workforce', 'cut', 'production', 'rate', 'response', 'coronavirus', 'pandemic', 'ensue', 'cash', 'crunch', 'airframer', 'announce', 'cut', 'report', 'loss', 'quarter', 'reduction', 'production', 'rate', 'continued', 'impact', 'coronavirus', 'business', 'force', 'u', 'reduce', 'size', 'workforce', 'sorry', 'deliver', 'news', 'chief', 'executive', 'david', 'calhoun', 'say', 'letter', 'staff', 'chicagoheadquartered', 'cut', 'total', 'employment', 'layoff', 'voluntary', 'departure', 'normal', 'staff', 'turnover', 'letter', 'say', 'staff', 'meaning', 'job', 'cut', 'make', 'even', 'deeper', 'reduction', 'area', 'expose', 'condition', 'commercial', 'customer', 'across', 'commercial', 'airplane', 'service', 'business', 'well', 'corporate', 'function', 'say', 'calhoun', 'note', 'shrink', 'size', 'executive', 'management', 'team', 'production', 'stillgrounded', 'resume', 'low', 'rate', 'gradually', 'increase', 'per', 'month', 'far', 'gradual', 'increase', 'correspond', 'market', 'demand', 'say', 'low', 'output', 'add', 'cost', 'production', 'upheaval', 'bring', 'estimate', 'total', 'cost', 'abnormal', 'production', 'say', 'make', 'monthly', 'regulator', 'ground', 'type', 'march', 'cut', 'output', 'per', 'month', 'currently', 'fall', 'monthly', 'previous', 'plan', 'intend', 'reduce', 'production', 'monthly', 'increase', 'per', 'month', 'additionally', 'reduce', 'monthly', 'combine', 'output', 'monthly', 'take', 'measure', 'approach', 'rate', 'ramp', 'currently', 'build', 'monthly', 'expect', 'begin', 'deliver', 'airframer', 'adjust', 'output', 'currently', 'respective', 'rate', 'per', 'month', 'global', 'pandemic', 'change', 'way', 'live', 'work', 'change', 'industry', 'face', 'utterly', 'unexpected', 'challenge', 'calhoun', 'say', 'delay', 'purchase', 'jet', 'put', 'brake', 'delivery', 'schedule', 'defer', 'elective', 'maintenance', 'add', 'see', 'dramatic', 'impact', 'commercial', 'service', 'business', 'ground', 'fleet', 'decrease', 'demand', 'operation', 'burn', 'quarter', 'start', 'period', 'cash', 'take', 'roughly', 'loan', 'quarter', 'end', 'march', 'cash', 'meaning', 'actually', 'use', 'cash', 'quarter', 'note', 'bank', 'america', 'merrill', 'lynch', 'analyst', 'ronald', 'epstein', 'include', 'operation', 'cash', 'burn', 'repayment', 'debt', 'financing', 'epstein', 'say', 'access', 'additional', 'liquidity', 'critical', 'manufacturing', 'sector', 'bridge', 'recovery', 'actively', 'explore', 'available', 'option', 'believe', 'able', 'obtain', 'sufficient', 'liquidity', 'fund', 'operation', 'say', 'say', 'consider', 'apply', 'government', 'aid', 'coronavirus', 'relief', 'package', 'note', 'step', 'recently', 'take', 'shore', 'finance', 'draw', 'term', 'loan', 'cut', 'operating', 'cost', 'halt', 'stock', 'repurchase', 'dividend', 'payment', 'reduce', 'research', 'development', 'expense', 'quarter', 'revenue', 'decline', 'cost', 'slip', 'coronavirus', 'add', 'unprecedented', 'pressure', 'business', 'remain', 'confident', 'longterm', 'future', 'say', 'calhoun', 'continue', 'support', 'defence', 'customer', 'critical', 'national', 'security', 'mission', 'progress', 'toward', 'safe', 'return', 'service', 'drive', 'safety', 'quality', 'operational', 'excellence', 'every', 'day', 'travel', 'always', 'coronavirus', 'ground', 'particularly', 'hammer', 'commercial', 'airplane', 'unit', 'lose', 'quarter', 'reverse', 'profit', 'period', 'commercial', 'revenue', 'decline', 'roughly', 'half', 'deliver', 'commercial', 'period', 'quarter', 'say', 'quarter', 'expense', 'include', 'precoronavirus', 'production', 'suspension', 'address', 'issue', 'hardware', 'suspension', 'seattlearea', 'production', 'amid', 'coronavirus', 'pandemic', 'report', 'low', 'margin', 'global', 'service', 'revenue', 'remain', 'largely', 'flat', 'although', 'unit', 'profit', 'increase']"
"European authorities are putting forward proposals to ease airline licensing rules and ground-handling firms' regulatory burdens, with the intention of reducing costs during the coronavirus crisis. Airlines which are unable to meet financial obligations over the next 12 months would normally have their operating licences revoked, or be issued with a temporary licence to enable the operator to restructure. But the European Commission states that a temporary licence “sends a very negative signal” to the market about the airline's ability to survive – impeding cash-flow and exacerbating its financial problems. “It is likely that many airlines, which were financially healthy before the crisis, will end up in a situation whereby their liquidity problems lead to the legal need for their operating licence to be suspended, revoked or replaced by a temporary licence,” it states. The Commission says this would create an unnecessary administrative burden with no clear safety or economic benefit, and it is proposing to suspend temporarily this obligation on the condition that safety is not jeopardised. It also says that the coronavirus crisis is likely to last for several months, which means temporarily lifting procedural requirements on emergency measures relating to traffic rights, which were originally designed to address short-term issues. This will enable states to keep proportionate emergency measures in place beyond 14 days. The proposal will extend until the end of 2021 the contracts of European Union ground-handing suppliers which were due to expire by the end of this year. This is intended to provide greater security to the creditors of ground-handling firms, whose activities have been badly hit by the crisis. “Bankruptcies [of ground-handlers] would be detrimental to the entire sector in that they would restrict competition in the short and medium term – and lead to a disruption of ground-handling services, which could also affect the recovery,” the Commission says. It adds that it will introduce an urgent procedure allowing an airport operator – in the event of a ground-handling firm's collapsing – to directly choose a replacement handler, for a six-month period, without having to organise a formal selection process. European transport commissioner Adina Valean says the proposals “should allow companies in the [air transport] sector to start focusing on their much-needed recovery”.",4,249,8.0,0.1903,"government, uk, carrier, business, state, share, south, airway, financial, plan","['european', 'authority', 'put', 'forward', 'proposal', 'ease', 'licensing', 'rule', 'groundhandling', 'firm', 'regulatory', 'burden', 'intention', 'reduce', 'cost', 'coronavirus', 'crisis', 'unable', 'meet', 'financial', 'obligation', 'next', 'month', 'normally', 'operating', 'licence', 'revoke', 'issue', 'temporary', 'licence', 'enable', 'operator', 'restructure', 'european', 'commission', 'state', 'temporary', 'licence', 'sends', 'negative', 'signal', 'market', 'ability', 'survive', 'impede', 'cashflow', 'exacerbate', 'financial', 'problem', 'likely', 'many', 'financially', 'healthy', 'crisis', 'end', 'situation', 'whereby', 'liquidity', 'problem', 'lead', 'legal', 'need', 'operating', 'licence', 'suspend', 'revoke', 'replace', 'temporary', 'licence', 'state', 'commission', 'say', 'create', 'unnecessary', 'administrative', 'burden', 'clear', 'safety', 'economic', 'benefit', 'propose', 'suspend', 'temporarily', 'obligation', 'condition', 'safety', 'jeopardise', 'say', 'coronavirus', 'crisis', 'likely', 'several', 'month', 'mean', 'temporarily', 'lift', 'procedural', 'requirement', 'emergency', 'measure', 'relate', 'traffic', 'right', 'originally', 'design', 'address', 'shortterm', 'issue', 'enable', 'state', 'keep', 'proportionate', 'emergency', 'measure', 'place', 'beyond', 'day', 'proposal', 'extend', 'end', 'contract', 'european', 'union', 'groundhanding', 'supplier', 'due', 'expire', 'end', 'intend', 'provide', 'great', 'security', 'creditor', 'groundhandling', 'firm', 'whose', 'activity', 'badly', 'hit', 'crisis', 'bankruptcy', 'groundhandlers', 'detrimental', 'entire', 'sector', 'restrict', 'competition', 'short', 'medium', 'term', 'lead', 'disruption', 'groundhandling', 'service', 'affect', 'recovery', 'commission', 'say', 'add', 'introduce', 'urgent', 'procedure', 'allow', 'airport', 'operator', 'event', 'groundhandling', 'firm', 'collapse', 'directly', 'choose', 'replacement', 'handler', 'sixmonth', 'period', 'without', 'organise', 'formal', 'selection', 'process', 'european', 'transport', 'commissioner', 'adina', 'valean', 'say', 'proposal', 'allow', 'transport', 'sector', 'start', 'focus', 'muchneeded', 'recovery']"
"Airbus's first-quarter earnings in the commercial aircraft sector have fallen by more than 80% under the impact of fewer deliveries arising from the coronavirus crisis. The ariframer says it is maintaining a “strong focus” on cash containment after its “solid” start to the year rapidly deteriorated as the pandemic evolved. “We are now in the midst of the gravest crisis the aerospace industry has ever known,” says Airbus chief executive Guillaume Faury. The company has opted to cut commercial aircraft production rates and review its longer-term cost structure to ensure it can return to normal operations. “We need to work as an industry to restore passenger confidence in air travel as we learn to co-exist with this pandemic,” says Faury. “We're focused on the resilience of our company to ensure business continuity.” Airbus has previously disclosed that it delivered 122 aircraft in the quarter to 31 March, 40 fewer than in the same period last year, and some 60 could not be handed over, largely as a result of government travel restrictions. Commercial aircraft revenues were down 22% to €7.5 billion and earnings in the sector dropped by 82% to €57 million. Its adjusted commercial EBIT was €191 million, down 59%. Airbus says it took a €33 million charge relating to the A380 programme, which is being terminated. Across the company overall free cash flow amounted to negative €8 billion, close to double the negative €4.3 billion from last year – although this included the payment of €3.6 billion in penalties over the high-profile bribery case, and free cash flow would otherwise have remained at a similar level to the first quarter of 2019. The company's total adjusted EBIT for the first quarter halved to €281 million, and it made a net loss of €481 million compared with a previous profit of €40 million. Airbus says it will “continue to focus on cash preservation” over the coming quarters and “will be reducing cash outflows”. It says it expects measures taken so far to reduce capital expenditure this year by around €700 million, to € 1.9 billion.",4,250,3.0,0.2327,"passenger, loss, operating, revenue, traffic, month, increase, capacity, decline, result","['firstquarter', 'earnings', 'commercial', 'sector', 'fall', 'impact', 'delivery', 'arise', 'coronavirus', 'crisis', 'ariframer', 'say', 'maintain', 'strong', 'focus', 'cash', 'containment', 'solid', 'start', 'rapidly', 'deteriorate', 'pandemic', 'evolve', 'midst', 'gravest', 'crisis', 'industry', 'ever', 'know', 'say', 'chief', 'executive', 'guillaume', 'faury', 'opt', 'cut', 'commercial', 'production', 'rate', 'review', 'longerterm', 'cost', 'structure', 'ensure', 'return', 'normal', 'operation', 'need', 'work', 'industry', 'restore', 'passenger', 'confidence', 'travel', 'learn', 'coexist', 'pandemic', 'say', 'faury', 'focus', 'resilience', 'ensure', 'business', 'previously', 'disclose', 'deliver', 'quarter', 'march', 'period', 'hand', 'largely', 'result', 'government', 'travel', 'restriction', 'commercial', 'revenue', 'earnings', 'sector', 'drop', 'adjust', 'commercial', 'ebit', 'say', 'take', 'charge', 'relate', 'programme', 'terminate', 'across', 'overall', 'free', 'cash', 'flow', 'amount', 'negative', 'close', 'double', 'negative', 'although', 'include', 'payment', 'penalty', 'highprofile', 'bribery', 'case', 'free', 'cash', 'flow', 'otherwise', 'remain', 'similar', 'level', 'quarter', 'total', 'adjust', 'ebit', 'quarter', 'halve', 'make', 'net', 'loss', 'compare', 'previous', 'profit', 'say', 'continue', 'focus', 'cash', 'preservation', 'come', 'quarter', 'reduce', 'cash', 'outflow', 'say', 'expect', 'measure', 'take', 'far', 'reduce', 'capital', 'expenditure', 'around']"
"Pan-European air navigation organisation Eurocontrol has underlined the importance of a co-ordinated approach to operational procedures and lifting of national restrictions during recovery from the coronavirus crisis. It has illustrated the potential difference between scenarios based on co-ordinated measures – which Eurocontrol estimates would result in the loss of 45% of flights, some 5 million, this year – and unco-ordinated measures which would lose 57% of flights, around 6.2 million. Lack of co-ordination, it says, will impede the rate of recovery. While the scenarios outlined are not a forecast, it stresses, they illustrate the impact of implementation of measures from mid-June which pick up in July. “If airlines have to comply with one set of regulations on departure and another set when the flight arrives in another state, then this will be particularly onerous on the industry,” says the organisation. “The difference between the two scenarios is significant and highlights that the development of a common approach is vital in order to minimise the disruption.” Eurocontrol's analysis assumes the return initially of intra-European traffic – based on the evidence that some 40% of domestic flights in China are operating – and this forms the basis of the scenario activity, which takes into account opinions from several organisations including ICAO, IATA, airline chiefs and the International Monetary Fund. Civil air navigation organisation CANSO states that European traffic, in the second week of April 2020, fell by 89% compared with the first week of January.",4,251,9.0,0.1383,"industry, crisis, demand, coronavirus, global, iata, market, level, cargo, expect","['paneuropean', 'navigation', 'organisation', 'eurocontrol', 'underlined', 'importance', 'coordinate', 'approach', 'operational', 'procedure', 'lift', 'national', 'restriction', 'recovery', 'coronavirus', 'crisis', 'illustrate', 'potential', 'difference', 'scenario', 'base', 'coordinate', 'measure', 'eurocontrol', 'estimate', 'result', 'loss', 'uncoordinated', 'measure', 'lose', 'around', 'lack', 'coordination', 'say', 'impede', 'rate', 'recovery', 'scenario', 'outline', 'forecast', 'stress', 'illustrate', 'impact', 'implementation', 'measure', 'midjune', 'pick', 'july', 'comply', 'set', 'regulation', 'departure', 'another', 'set', 'arrives', 'another', 'state', 'particularly', 'onerous', 'industry', 'say', 'organisation', 'difference', 'scenario', 'significant', 'highlight', 'development', 'common', 'approach', 'vital', 'order', 'minimise', 'eurocontrol', 'analysis', 'assumes', 'return', 'initially', 'intraeuropean', 'traffic', 'base', 'evidence', 'domestic', 'operating', 'form', 'basis', 'scenario', 'activity', 'take', 'account', 'opinion', 'several', 'organisation', 'include', 'icao', 'iata', 'chief', 'international', 'monetary', 'fund', 'civil', 'navigation', 'organisation', 'canso', 'state', 'european', 'traffic', 'second', 'week', 'april', 'fell', 'compare', 'week', 'january']"
"The US Department of Commerce has tightened restrictions on certain technology exports to China, Russia and Venezuela, a move with still-unclear ramifications on US aerospace suppliers. Those countries are declared adversaries of the USA, and the Commerce Department is blocking shipment to those nations of technology it believes could be repurposed for military uses, the agency says on 27 April. The Commerce Department has concern those countries will use civilian supply chains or “civilian-use pretenses” to develop weapons, military aircraft or surveillance technology, it says. The agency has provided few details about the tighter controls, but notes “semiconductor equipment” and “sensors” would be restricted. It did not immediately respond to a request for more information. “It is important to consider the ramifications of doing business with countries that have histories of diverting goods purchased from US companies for military applications,” says Department of Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross. “Certain entities in China, Russia and Venezuela have sought to circumvent America's export controls, and undermine American interests in general, and so we will remain vigilant to ensure US technology does not get into the wrong hands.” China and Russia have long tried to re-engineer US aerospace technology for military use, as well as for use in products made by government-backed commercial aerospace firms. On 8 April, GE Aviation received a license from the Commerce Department to supply CFM International LEAP-1C engines for use on Chinese airframer Comac's C919 narrowbody programme. US supplier GE and French company Safran Aircraft Engines jointly own CFM. The deal was in limbo due to the USA-China trade war and concerns that intellectual property could be stolen and used by Chinese commercial engine manufacturers. There were also concerns that the engines could be used to help boost the capabilities of China's military jet turbine manufacturers.

"British Airways is proposing a restructuring programme which, it warns, could result in up to 12,000 redundancies. The IAG-owned carrier states that it has notified its trade unions about the measure and – while it remains subject to consultation – the proposal is likely to affect “most” of the UK airline's employees.  British Airways is bracing for the recovery to take several years It furloughed over 22,600 personnel in April. But BA says it is preparing for the expectation that the recovery of passenger demand to last year's pre-coronavirus crisis levels will “take several years”. UK cockpit union BALPA says the disclosure has “come as a bolt out of the blue”, adding that the flag-carrier's personnel are “devastated”. “BALPA does not accept that a case has been made for these job losses and we will be fighting to save every single one,” it insists. Over the first quarter IAG turned in an operating loss of €535 million, and it has taken an exceptional charge of €1.3 billion on its pre-tax profit arising from ineffective fuel and currency hedging. All of the reduction in the operating result for the quarter occurred in March, says the company. BA bore the majority of the impact, followed by Iberia and Aer Lingus. Spanish budget carrier Vueling experienced a “modest increase” in operating loss, says IAG. IAG adds that it expects its operating loss for the second quarter to be “significantly worse”, given the collapse of passenger traffic and despite a degree of relief from the government on staff costs. Passenger capacity in April and May has been cut by 94%. IAG conducted some 350 cargo-only flights in the month to 26 April. “Capacity from June will depend on the timing of the easing of lockdowns and travel restrictions by governments around the world,” the company adds. Total cash and undrawn aircraft finance facilities amounted to €9.5 billion at the end of March, including €6.95 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and interest-bearing deposits. IAG is set to detail its results for the quarter on 7 May.

"The current capacity shortage in the air cargo market is likely to be resolved – but not in the industry's favour – as the global economic crisis depresses demand for such services, according to IATA. “The capacity crunch will, unfortunately, be a temporary problem,” states the airline association's director general Alexandre de Juniac during a briefing today. “The recession will likely hit air cargo at least as severely as it does the rest of the economy.” A mismatch between air cargo supply and demand has caused freight rates to rise in recent weeks. Crucially, however, this has been driven by falls in capacity outpacing drops in demand, largely because passenger aircraft with significant bellyhold capacity have been grounded amid swingeing restrictions on air travel. With a tentative recovery in passenger services forecast to begin in the third quarter, more belly capacity will return to the market as the world grapples with a deep economic shock. IATA cites a World Trade Organization forecast that offers “little indication of a quick recovery” and sets out a range of scenarios that suggest global trade could contract by 13-32% in 2020. “This will deeply impact air cargo's prospects,” IATA suggests, despite some relief being provided by an increase in pharmaceutical shipments during the coronavirus pandemic. Therefore, while IATA suggests there is evidence that demand for air cargo is holding up relatively well versus other forms of freight transport, the outlook for the rest of the year is extremely challenging. ”To keep the supply chain moving to meet what demand might exist, airlines must be financially viable,” de Juniac says. “The need for financial relief for airlines by whatever means possible remains urgent.” In its latest data for the freight sector, IATA states that global cargo demand measured in freight tonne kilometres was down 15% in March year on year, while capacity saw a steeper drop of 23%. In international markets – which account for 87% of air cargo – belly capacity shrank by 44% in March as carriers around the world grounded passenger aircraft. This was partially offset by a 6.2% increase in capacity through expanded use of freighter aircraft, including the deployment of idle passenger aircraft for all-cargo operations.",4,255,9.0,0.4229,"industry, crisis, demand, coronavirus, global, iata, market, level, cargo, expect","['current', 'capacity', 'shortage', 'cargo', 'market', 'likely', 'resolve', 'industry', 'favour', 'global', 'economic', 'crisis', 'depresses', 'demand', 'service', 'accord', 'iata', 'capacity', 'crunch', 'unfortunately', 'temporary', 'problem', 'state', 'association', 'director', 'general', 'alexandre', 'de', 'juniac', 'briefing', 'today', 'recession', 'likely', 'hit', 'cargo', 'least', 'severely', 'rest', 'mismatch', 'cargo', 'supply', 'demand', 'cause', 'freight', 'rate', 'rise', 'recent', 'week', 'crucially', 'however', 'driven', 'fall', 'capacity', 'outpace', 'drop', 'demand', 'largely', 'passenger', 'significant', 'bellyhold', 'capacity', 'ground', 'amid', 'swinge', 'restriction', 'travel', 'tentative', 'recovery', 'passenger', 'service', 'forecast', 'begin', 'third', 'quarter', 'belly', 'capacity', 'return', 'market', 'world', 'grapple', 'deep', 'economic', 'shock', 'iata', 'cite', 'world', 'trade', 'organization', 'forecast', 'offer', 'little', 'indication', 'quick', 'recovery', 'set', 'range', 'scenario', 'suggest', 'global', 'trade', 'contract', 'deeply', 'impact', 'cargo', 'prospect', 'iata', 'suggests', 'despite', 'relief', 'provide', 'increase', 'pharmaceutical', 'shipment', 'coronavirus', 'pandemic', 'therefore', 'iata', 'suggests', 'evidence', 'demand', 'cargo', 'hold', 'relatively', 'well', 'versus', 'form', 'freight', 'transport', 'outlook', 'rest', 'extremely', 'challenge', 'keep', 'supply', 'chain', 'move', 'meet', 'demand', 'might', 'exist', 'must', 'financially', 'viable', 'de', 'juniac', 'say', 'need', 'financial', 'relief', 'whatever', 'mean', 'possible', 'remains', 'late', 'data', 'freight', 'sector', 'iata', 'state', 'global', 'cargo', 'demand', 'measure', 'freight', 'tonne', 'kilometre', 'march', 'capacity', 'saw', 'steeper', 'drop', 'international', 'market', 'account', 'cargo', 'belly', 'capacity', 'shrank', 'march', 'carrier', 'around', 'world', 'ground', 'passenger', 'partially', 'offset', 'increase', 'capacity', 'expand', 'use', 'freighter', 'include', 'deployment', 'idle', 'passenger', 'allcargo', 'operation']"
"Saab has begun promoting an active electronically scanned array (AESA) antenna for its PS-05/A fighter radar, offering an upgrade option for operators of its Gripen C/D, and other legacy types. During a roughly 90min debut flight aboard a Gripen D test aircraft conducted from the Swedish company's Linkoping site on 8 April, the AESA sensor “collected data while detecting and tracking objects”, Saab says. New array was installed on Gripen D test aircraft Anders Carp, head of the company's aeronautics business area, describes these as having been “targets of opportunity” such as general aviation aircraft, due to a lack of commercial airliner activity during the coronavirus crisis. “We had a very successful first flight, both in terms of capability and stability,” Carp says. Future tests, to be conducted following data validation from the sensor's airborne debut, will be expanded to incorporate “fighter targets”, he notes. In all, around 15 flights are planned over a period of three to four months. Integration of the AESA array – which features more than 500 gallium nitride transmit/receive modules – required no alteration to the Gripen's power or cooling provision, Carp says. “We're just changing the array itself, and using exactly the same back-end as the [PS-05/A] Mk4” with some software updates, he notes. “We have the possibility now to get the full radar range to use [MBDA's] Meteor or similar [air-to-air] missiles,” Carp notes of the enhancement. The availability of an ITAR-free AESA array offers a potential upgrade path for existing Gripen C/D operators, which in addition to the Swedish air force include the Czech Republic, Hungary, South Africa and Thailand. As well as being a candidate for such updates, the new array will also be offered with Saab's proposed Gripen Aggressor platform, which is intended to meet growing military demand for adversary training services. “The Gripen is a fairly small aircraft compared to many of the competitors, which makes the size of the radar suitable for many other platforms,” Carp notes. This could potentially include advanced jet trainers, and even unmanned air vehicles, he suggests. Carp points to the fighter AESA design as having drawn on Saab's experience with developing other X-band sensors, including for the Giraffe 1X short-range ground-based air-defence radar. Its underlying technology could be scaled up to approaching an “Erieye-size” sensor for airborne ground surveillance tasks, he indicates. “If there's a customer that wants it now we're ready to start production – we're more or less ready to take orders,” Carp says.

"Textron Aviation has unveiled a finance programme to help Citation business jet owners in the USA fund aftermarket modifications as they take advantage of the lull in travel due to the coronavirus outbreak to upgrade their aircraft. Backed by company's finance division, the initiative should help to spread the financial burden of costly interior refurbishments and modifications such as flightdeck and in-flight connectivity upgrades. In addition, it will drive business to Textron Aviation's 11 Citation service centres in the USA. “This new programme offers customers a path to completing aftermarket modifications or upgrades on a timeline that is best for them and their business,” says Textron Aviation. ”Some customers are using unexpected downtime as a result of Covid-19 to complete upgrade projects that they have been considering or planning for a different time.” Textron says the programme is available to “most” of the 5,000 US-registered Citation fleet, although it would not be drawn on which models are excluded.

"Scandinavian carrier SAS has begun work on cutting up to 5,000 full-time positions from its future workforce as it warns it is likely to take “some years” before air travel demand returns to pre-crisis levels. SAS will hold talks with unions over the proposed cuts, which will apply to staff across Denmark, Norway and Sweden, on possible measures to mitigate the number of jobs lost. It also notes that as those affected have an average notice period of six months, initiating the action now gives it flexibility to ramp-up the business if demand returns quickly. The Star Alliance carrier today operates only a limited domestic network in Norway and Sweden. ”Given the current restrictions, SAS expects limited activity in the important summer season. In addition, it will most likely take some years before demand returns to the levels seen before Covid-19,” the carrier says. “Covid-19 has forced SAS to face a new and unprecedented reality that will reverberate not only in the coming months, but also during the coming years,” says SAS chief executive Rickard Gustafson. ”We need to adapt our cost base to the prevailing circumstances. Regretfully, we are forced to adapt our workforce to lower passenger demand. ”We will now work intensively together with trade union representatives and others to identify solutions so that as few people as possible are affected. Furthermore, we remain ready to quickly ramp-up operations and reduce the number of affected positions if demand recovers more quickly.” The potential cuts would cover up to 1,900 full-time positions in Sweden, 1,700 in Denmark and 1,300 in Norway. ”During this process, SAS will actively engage with its unions and other stakeholders to seek solutions to reduce the number of actual layoffs across the group, as well as other productivity enhancements,” the carrier says. SAS halted the vast majority of its passenger traffic on 16 March as a result of the spread of the coronavirus pandemic through Europe. The carrier on 7 April temporarily laid off 11,000 employees and made 120 positions in Sweden permanently redundant, as it warned that the state support it is set to receive “will not suffice” if the coronavirus crisis persists. Struggling Scandinavian rival Norwegian yesterday said it expects to remain in a “hibernation phase” – in which 95% of its fleet is grounded – until the second quarter of 2021.",4,258,2.0,0.2016,"executive, chief, cut, add, situation, staff, crisis, make, coronavirus, employee","['scandinavian', 'carrier', 'sa', 'begin', 'work', 'cut', 'fulltime', 'position', 'future', 'workforce', 'warns', 'likely', 'take', 'travel', 'demand', 'return', 'precrisis', 'level', 'sa', 'hold', 'talk', 'union', 'propose', 'cut', 'apply', 'staff', 'across', 'denmark', 'norway', 'sweden', 'possible', 'measure', 'mitigate', 'number', 'job', 'lose', 'note', 'affected', 'average', 'notice', 'period', 'month', 'initiate', 'action', 'give', 'flexibility', 'rampup', 'business', 'demand', 'return', 'quickly', 'star', 'alliance', 'carrier', 'today', 'operates', 'limited', 'domestic', 'network', 'norway', 'sweden', 'give', 'current', 'restriction', 'sa', 'expect', 'limited', 'activity', 'important', 'summer', 'season', 'addition', 'likely', 'take', 'demand', 'return', 'level', 'see', 'coronavirus', 'carrier', 'say', 'coronavirus', 'force', 'sa', 'face', 'unprecedented', 'reality', 'reverberate', 'come', 'month', 'come', 'say', 'sa', 'chief', 'executive', 'rickard', 'gustafson', 'need', 'adapt', 'cost', 'base', 'prevail', 'circumstance', 'regretfully', 'force', 'adapt', 'workforce', 'low', 'passenger', 'demand', 'work', 'intensively', 'together', 'trade', 'union', 'representative', 'others', 'identify', 'solution', 'people', 'possible', 'affected', 'furthermore', 'remain', 'ready', 'quickly', 'rampup', 'operation', 'reduce', 'number', 'affected', 'position', 'demand', 'recovers', 'potential', 'cut', 'cover', 'fulltime', 'position', 'sweden', 'denmark', 'norway', 'process', 'sa', 'actively', 'engage', 'union', 'stakeholder', 'seek', 'solution', 'reduce', 'number', 'actual', 'layoff', 'across', 'well', 'productivity', 'enhancement', 'carrier', 'say', 'sa', 'halt', 'vast', 'majority', 'passenger', 'traffic', 'march', 'result', 'spread', 'coronavirus', 'pandemic', 'europe', 'carrier', 'april', 'temporarily', 'laid', 'employee', 'make', 'position', 'sweden', 'permanently', 'redundant', 'warn', 'state', 'support', 'set', 'receive', 'suffice', 'coronavirus', 'crisis', 'persists', 'struggle', 'scandinavian', 'rival', 'norwegian', 'yesterday', 'say', 'expect', 'remain', 'hibernation', 'phase', 'fleet', 'ground', 'second', 'quarter']"
"The parent company of All Nippon Airways (ANA), ANA Holdings, saw coronavirus hurt both profitability and revenue during its 2019 fiscal year, as it painted a bleak outlook for the immediate future. Consolidated operating profit of for the 12 months ended 31 March fell 63% to Y61 billion ($569 million), says the carrier. Operating revenues fell 4.1% to Y1.97 trillion. The group's net profit fell 75% to Y27.6 billion, while operating expenses rose 1.1% to Y1.91 trillion. As of 31 March, cash and cash equivalents were sharply lower at Y176 billion, compared with Y212 billion a year earlier. ANA blamed the coronavirus pandemic and the resultant demand drop for its weaker result. The 2019 fiscal year saw the completion of the merger of low-cost units Peach and Vanilla Air. In addition to suffering a demand drop due to coronavirus, ANA's LCC business also suffered from political issues, namely the anti-government protests in Hong Kong as well as poor diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea. Cargo suffered weak demand during the fiscal year owing to trade tensions between the USA and China. The fourth quarter reduction in flights owing to coronavirus also hurt both cargo volumes and revenue. International cargo revenue during the year fell 18% to Y22.3 billion. “ANA expects the current decline in passenger demand will continue, as it is unclear when the spread of the coronavirus will end and for government travel restrictions to be lifted,” said ANA Holdings chief financial officer Ichiro Fukuzawa. He adds that given the challenging environment the company will not make a forecast. “At the same time, we are securing funds through bank loans and raising the amount of credit commitment line, and actively taking measures at a conservative level to maintain stability in liquidity on hand.” In April the group started the process of securing funds of Y100 billion through bank loans. In addition to an existing Y150 billion credit line, it also hopes to finalise a contract for Y350 billion. The airline has cut international services by 90% and domestic services by 70%. In addition to the network changes, it is reducing costs through pay cuts and placing employees on leave. Until the coronavirus emerged in China, the carrier was benefiting from the gradual recovery in the Japanese economy, with high corporate earnings and improved personal consumption. In its outlook for the 2020 financial year ended 31 March 2021, ANA expressed concern about the effect of coronavirus on the global economy. “Although the Japanese government plans to implement measures to support the economy, the deterioration of the job and disposable income environment caused by declining corporate earnings and the slump in consumer spending is thought to be unavoidable,” it says.",4,259,3.0,0.3003,"passenger, loss, operating, revenue, traffic, month, increase, capacity, decline, result","['parent', 'nippon', 'airway', 'ana', 'ana', 'holding', 'saw', 'coronavirus', 'hurt', 'profitability', 'revenue', 'fiscal', 'paint', 'bleak', 'outlook', 'immediate', 'future', 'consolidated', 'operating', 'profit', 'month', 'end', 'march', 'fell', 'say', 'carrier', 'operating', 'revenue', 'fell', 'trillion', 'net', 'profit', 'fell', 'operating', 'expense', 'rise', 'trillion', 'march', 'cash', 'cash', 'equivalent', 'sharply', 'low', 'compare', 'earlier', 'ana', 'blame', 'coronavirus', 'pandemic', 'resultant', 'demand', 'drop', 'weaker', 'result', 'fiscal', 'saw', 'completion', 'merger', 'lowcost', 'unit', 'peach', 'vanilla', 'addition', 'suffer', 'demand', 'drop', 'due', 'coronavirus', 'ana', 'lcc', 'business', 'suffer', 'political', 'issue', 'namely', 'antigovernment', 'protest', 'hong', 'kong', 'well', 'poor', 'diplomatic', 'relation', 'japan', 'south', 'korea', 'cargo', 'suffer', 'weak', 'demand', 'fiscal', 'owe', 'trade', 'tension', 'usa', 'fourth', 'quarter', 'reduction', 'owe', 'coronavirus', 'hurt', 'cargo', 'volume', 'revenue', 'international', 'cargo', 'revenue', 'fell', 'ana', 'expect', 'current', 'decline', 'passenger', 'demand', 'continue', 'unclear', 'spread', 'coronavirus', 'end', 'government', 'travel', 'restriction', 'lift', 'say', 'ana', 'holding', 'chief', 'financial', 'officer', 'ichiro', 'fukuzawa', 'add', 'give', 'challenge', 'environment', 'make', 'forecast', 'secure', 'fund', 'bank', 'loan', 'raise', 'amount', 'credit', 'commitment', 'line', 'actively', 'take', 'measure', 'conservative', 'level', 'maintain', 'stability', 'liquidity', 'april', 'start', 'process', 'secure', 'fund', 'bank', 'loan', 'addition', 'exist', 'credit', 'line', 'hope', 'finalise', 'contract', 'cut', 'international', 'service', 'domestic', 'service', 'addition', 'network', 'change', 'reduce', 'cost', 'pay', 'cut', 'place', 'employee', 'leave', 'coronavirus', 'emerge', 'carrier', 'benefiting', 'gradual', 'recovery', 'japanese', 'economy', 'high', 'corporate', 'earnings', 'improve', 'personal', 'consumption', 'outlook', 'financial', 'end', 'march', 'ana', 'express', 'concern', 'effect', 'coronavirus', 'global', 'economy', 'although', 'japanese', 'government', 'plan', 'implement', 'measure', 'support', 'economy', 'deterioration', 'job', 'disposable', 'income', 'environment', 'cause', 'decline', 'corporate', 'earnings', 'slump', 'consumer', 'spending', 'thought', 'unavoidable', 'say']"
"Pakistan and India are easing some of their coronavirus-related lockdown measures, though it will still be at least more than two weeks before aircraft flying scheduled international flights take to both countries' skies as Pakistan has extended its flight ban and India's remains subject to review. The lockdown in Pakistan has been extended for 15 more days until 9 May. On the ground at least, things have moved to a so-called “smart lockdown”, whereby there will be targeted tracking and tracing of cases while allowing some industrial and commercial activities to resume under safety guidelines, Reuters reported on 25 April. Around the same time, the government has extended the ban on international flights. The Aviation Division of Pakistan says in a press release posted on its Twitter account that “[a]s per the decision of the government of Pakistan”, the suspension of international flight operations has been extended up to 15 May at 23:59 local time. In recent days, flag carrier Pakistan International Airlines(PIA) has been focusing its attention on repatriating Pakistanis from overseas, including those from the United Arab Emirates. The airline has also slashed fares from Dubai to six destinations in Pakistan, to help with the Pakistani government's repatriation efforts. However, these repatriation flights are not utilising the airline's entire fleet. Cirium fleets data indicate that PIA's fleet consists of 33 aircraft, of which 11 are in service. Eight lessors have exposure to PIA to the tune of 20 aircraft. Pakistan has 13,328 confirmed coronavirus cases and 281 deaths as of 27 April, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Neighbouring India, which had 27,892 confirmed coronavirus cases and 881 deaths, began to ease some lockdown restrictions in parts of the country over the weekend. For example, shops in rural areas can reopen with half of their workers, who must wear masks and observe social distancing. However, domestic and international flights remain grounded until at least 3 May. Hardeep Singh Puri, the country's civil aviation minister, said in a 20 April Twitter post that flight restrictions would be lifted “once we are confident that spread of the virus has been controlled and it poses no danger to our country and people” and reiterated that no decision has yet been taken about when to reopen flights. India's island neighbour Sri Lanka, which has 523 confirmed cases and seven deaths, today reversed plans to end its coronavirus-related lockdown, extending it until 4 May after a spike in infections, reports the AFP. Sri Lankan Airlines has a fleet of 26 aircraft, 20 of which are in storage.

"Embraer has formally commenced arbitration proceedings following the decision by Boeing to terminate the companies' $4.2 billion merger. But the Brazilian airframer has offered little insight into its response to the sudden collapse of the proposed commercial and military partnership, and the extent to which it had prepared for such an eventuality. Embraer chief executive Francisco Gomes Neto, speaking during a 27 April briefing, said he was “surprised and disappointed” by Boeing's decision, reiterating the belief that the US firm had wrongly ended the agreement and disputing its claim of a failure by Embraer to meet conditions. He says Embraer has worked “non-stop, day and night” to conclude the deal, which has involved a “long, costly and complex process”. Gomes Neto would not be drawn on the overall cost to Embraer of the separation and preparatory work for the merger, beyond saying it was “substantial”, nor would he elaborate on the remedies sought from Boeing or even the conditions Boeing believes Embraer to have breached. Merger documents filed to the US Securities and Exchange Commission refer to two termination fees, one amounting to $75 million and the other, designated an “anti-trust termination fee”, of $100 million. Gomes Neto also remained vague on alternative plans that Embraer might pursue in the aftermath of Boeing's withdrawal, stating only that the company would “review” its commercial aviation structure and strategy. Embraer would remain open to possible partnerships, he says, but adds: “We want to do our homework first.” The company points out that regional aircraft are likely to play a strong role as the air transport industry recovers, and that it has not experienced any cancellations as a result of the current crisis. But it is yet to analyse the fallout from the Boeing split and says it is “too soon” to indicate whether it will reverse the separation measures for its commercial aviation operations and re-integrate the businesses. Embraer's share price fell by around 10% early on 27 April, the first day of trading since the deal's collapse. Executive vice-president of finance Antonio Carlos Garcia says the company is scrutinising its operations and has identified around $1 billion in potential cash savings for 2020. But he is confident about the company's liquidity position, describing it as “solid”. Embraer states that less than 15% of its outstanding debt is due within the next two years. The company ended last year with total cash of $2.8 billion and obtained a new loan of $600 million in mid-March. Carlos Garcia says the company ideally would keep cash above $2 billion to “absorb turbulence” but stresses that he currently “doesn't see any liquidity issue”. While Embraer acknowledges that this year will be “tough” and that 2021 will probably fall short of forecasts, Gomes Neto insists that, despite the economic conditions, the company “has a great future ahead”. Commercial aviation chief John Slattery is also upbeat over the manufacturer's prospects. “I'm confident Embraer will emerge stronger,” he states.",4,261,0.0,0.255,"order, business, jet, delivery, production, customer, deliver, commercial, quarter, include","['embraer', 'formally', 'commenced', 'arbitration', 'proceeding', 'follow', 'decision', 'terminate', 'merger', 'brazilian', 'airframer', 'offer', 'little', 'insight', 'response', 'sudden', 'collapse', 'propose', 'commercial', 'military', 'partnership', 'extent', 'prepared', 'eventuality', 'embraer', 'chief', 'executive', 'francisco', 'gomes', 'neto', 'speak', 'april', 'briefing', 'say', 'surprised', 'disappointed', 'decision', 'reiterate', 'belief', 'u', 'firm', 'wrongly', 'end', 'agreement', 'dispute', 'claim', 'failure', 'embraer', 'meet', 'condition', 'say', 'embraer', 'work', 'nonstop', 'day', 'night', 'conclude', 'deal', 'involve', 'long', 'costly', 'complex', 'process', 'gomes', 'neto', 'drawn', 'overall', 'cost', 'embraer', 'separation', 'preparatory', 'work', 'merger', 'beyond', 'say', 'substantial', 'elaborate', 'remedy', 'sought', 'even', 'condition', 'believe', 'embraer', 'breach', 'merger', 'document', 'file', 'u', 'security', 'exchange', 'commission', 'refer', 'termination', 'fee', 'amount', 'designate', 'antitrust', 'termination', 'fee', 'gomes', 'neto', 'remain', 'vague', 'alternative', 'plan', 'embraer', 'might', 'pursue', 'aftermath', 'withdrawal', 'state', 'review', 'commercial', 'structure', 'strategy', 'embraer', 'remain', 'open', 'possible', 'partnership', 'say', 'add', 'want', 'homework', 'point', 'regional', 'likely', 'play', 'strong', 'role', 'transport', 'industry', 'recovers', 'experienced', 'cancellation', 'result', 'current', 'crisis', 'yet', 'analyse', 'fallout', 'split', 'say', 'soon', 'indicate', 'whether', 'reverse', 'separation', 'measure', 'commercial', 'operation', 'reintegrate', 'business', 'embraer', 'share', 'price', 'fell', 'around', 'early', 'april', 'day', 'trading', 'since', 'deal', 'collapse', 'executive', 'vicepresident', 'finance', 'antonio', 'carlos', 'garcia', 'say', 'scrutinise', 'operation', 'identify', 'around', 'potential', 'cash', 'saving', 'confident', 'liquidity', 'position', 'describe', 'solid', 'embraer', 'state', 'less', 'outstanding', 'debt', 'due', 'within', 'next', 'end', 'total', 'cash', 'obtain', 'loan', 'midmarch', 'carlos', 'garcia', 'say', 'ideally', 'keep', 'cash', 'absorb', 'turbulence', 'stress', 'currently', 'see', 'liquidity', 'issue', 'embraer', 'acknowledges', 'tough', 'probably', 'fall', 'short', 'forecast', 'gomes', 'neto', 'insists', 'despite', 'economic', 'condition', 'great', 'future', 'ahead', 'commercial', 'chief', 'john', 'slattery', 'upbeat', 'manufacturer', 'prospect', 'confident', 'embraer', 'emerge', 'strong', 'state']"
"Estonia's government is to increase the share capital of local carrier Nordica by €30 million ($33 million) to help the airline through the coronavirus crisis – an investment which is conditional on the merger of Estonian aviation assets. Estonia's economics ministry says the share capital increase is conditional on the merger of state-owned Nordic Aviation Group (Nordica), capacity provider Regional Jet – which is part-owned by LOT Polish Airlines – and lessor Transpordi Varahaldus. The move is part of a wider €43 million investment by the Estonian government into state-owned transport companies, agreed on 24 April. Estonian minister of economic affairs and infrastructure Taavi Aas says the increase of share capital in state-owned companies is primarily intended to get out of the crisis as strongly as possible. Aas says the government also has “high expectations” for Nordica. ”In addition to the new business model, Nordica must provide as many direct routes as possible to important destinations in Europe,” he says. The government says a condition for the increase of the share capital of Nordica is the merger of Nordic Aviation Group, Regional Jet and Transpordi Varahaldus. ”Nordica must present the new business model to the government within two weeks,” the economics ministry says. Estonia established Nordic Avaition Group, known as Nordica, in late 2015 as a successor carrier after the collapse of Estonian Air. Nordica last October stopped flights under its own brand. Nordica has though been expanding operations of its capacity provider Regional Jet. The latter, which is 49% owned by LOT, operates flights for a variety of airlines using Bombardier CRJs and ATR 72s. In February it rebranded Regional Jet as Xfly. Transpordi Varahaldus is an investment entity that manages a fleet of seven CJR900s, which are on long-term lease to Nordica and sub-let to Regional Jet.",4,262,8.0,0.4232,"government, uk, carrier, business, state, share, south, airway, financial, plan","['estonia', 'government', 'increase', 'share', 'capital', 'local', 'carrier', 'nordica', 'help', 'coronavirus', 'crisis', 'investment', 'conditional', 'merger', 'estonian', 'asset', 'estonia', 'economics', 'ministry', 'say', 'share', 'capital', 'increase', 'conditional', 'merger', 'stateowned', 'nordic', 'nordica', 'capacity', 'provider', 'regional', 'jet', 'partowned', 'lot', 'polish', 'lessor', 'transpordi', 'varahaldus', 'move', 'part', 'wider', 'investment', 'estonian', 'government', 'stateowned', 'transport', 'agree', 'april', 'estonian', 'minister', 'economic', 'affair', 'infrastructure', 'taavi', 'aa', 'say', 'increase', 'share', 'capital', 'stateowned', 'primarily', 'intend', 'get', 'crisis', 'strongly', 'possible', 'aa', 'say', 'government', 'high', 'expectation', 'nordica', 'addition', 'business', 'model', 'nordica', 'must', 'provide', 'many', 'direct', 'route', 'possible', 'important', 'destination', 'europe', 'say', 'government', 'say', 'condition', 'increase', 'share', 'capital', 'nordica', 'merger', 'nordic', 'regional', 'jet', 'transpordi', 'varahaldus', 'nordica', 'must', 'present', 'business', 'model', 'government', 'within', 'week', 'economics', 'ministry', 'say', 'estonia', 'establish', 'nordic', 'avaition', 'know', 'nordica', 'late', 'successor', 'carrier', 'collapse', 'estonian', 'nordica', 'october', 'stop', 'brand', 'nordica', 'though', 'expand', 'operation', 'capacity', 'provider', 'regional', 'jet', 'latter', 'lot', 'operates', 'variety', 'use', 'bombardier', 'crjs', 'atr', 'february', 'rebranded', 'regional', 'jet', 'xfly', 'transpordi', 'varahaldus', 'investment', 'entity', 'manages', 'fleet', 'longterm', 'lease', 'nordica', 'sublet', 'regional', 'jet']"
"European Commission regulators have approved a €550 million ($595 million) loan from the German state to help struggling leisure carrier Condor through the coronavirus crisis. Condor says the package, granted under the federal government's Corona Shield Programme, secures its flight operations after Polish Aviation Group (PGL) withdrew from its planned purchase of the carrier. Condor has been seeking a new investor following the collapse of its parent Thomas Cook Group last year and in October had required a €380 million bridging loan. ”Condor will receive a loan of €294 million as corona aid as well as €256 million to fully refinance the bridging loan that the leisure airline received for last winter following the insolvency of Thomas Cook,” Condor says. The German carrier says it applied for the guarantee in order to prevent liquidity bottlenecks caused by the coronavirus pandemic, which has grounded its holiday passenger flights, and to repay the bridging loan. That loan was to be paid back under the terms of the PGL acquisition agreed at the start of the year, but which the Polish carrier announced it was pulling out of earlier this month. “As an operationally healthy and profitable company, Condor has gotten into trouble for the second time in almost half a year through no fault of its own - once by Thomas Cook and then by the effects of the Corona pandemic,” says Condor chief executive Ralf Teckentrup. ”Even though the coming period will be a challenge, especially as an airline, we are confident that through the dedication, commitment and passion of each and every one of them we will continue to fulfil the trust placed in us,” he adds. The European Commission says the exact damage suffered by Condor as a result of the outbreak will be quantified after the coronavirus crisis, based on the airline's accounts for 2020. It notes the method used to quantify the damage will be subject to the Commission's prior approval and a claw-back mechanism will ensure any public support exceeding the damage incurred will be returned. The Commission's executive vice-president Margrethe Vestager, in charge of competition policy, says: ”This state-guaranteed €550 million loan will allow Germany to compensate Condor, operating in the particularly hard hit aviation sector, for part of the damage suffered due to the coronavirus outbreak. We co-operate with member states to find workable solutions to support companies in these difficult times, in line with EU rules.” The European Commission has already judged the coronavirus pandemic qualifies as an exceptional occurrence under European Union state aid rules, justifying “exceptional interventions” by its member states to compensate for damage linked to the coronavirus outbreak.

"SIA Group has set aside S$3.3 billion ($2.3 billion) of the S$8.8 billion it plans to raise, from issuing equity and mandatory convertible bonds, for aircraft purchases and aircraft related payments. “The rationale for these [aircraft] purchases remains valid even under the present scenario given that it would enable SIA to proceed with its adoption of new-generation aircraft, both as replacement for existing fleet and for growth, as these new generation aircraft will not only provide an enhanced travel experience to our customers but also, provide better operating efficiency and lower emissions,” the group said in response to questions from the Securities Investors' Association (Singapore) (SIAS), as disclosed to the Singapore Exchange. Cirium fleets data shows that the group expects to receive 18 aircraft for the rest of 2020, and another seven in the first quarter of 2021. These comprise seven Airbus A320neo family aircraft and five A350s, nine Boeing 787s, along with four 737 Max 8 jets, which have yet to be re-certified following a global grounding in March 2019. SIA says: “We believe that the proceeds of S$8.8 billion from the rights issue will allow us to meet our liquidity and operational requirements, including operating cash flow needs, capital expenditure requirements and fixed obligations, for a good part of financial year 2020/2021.” The group will utilise S$3.7 billion as operating cash flow, for funding fixed costs and other operating expenses incurred “during this period of reduced operations and the subsequent recovery period”. The remaining S$1.8 billion will service debt and other contractual payments. “Furthermore, up to S$6.2 billion of additional [mandatory convertible bonds] may be issued within a 15-month period after the EGM [on 30 April], which will provide us with additional liquidity if this crisis extends for a prolonged period. “This will also provide us with the resources to capitalise on any opportunities that may arise following the abatement of the Covid-19 pandemic from a position of strength, and position us for growth as soon as the ongoing crisis resolves.” In response to why SIA opted for equity rather than debt financing, the group says it has become very difficult for airlines to tap the debt capital markets. “We will continue to explore other traditional funding channels such as secured financing and sale-and-leaseback transactions but the opportunities remain limited in the current climate and it would not be possible to raise a similar quantum from these channels. “Moreover, such transactions would create more cash outflow obligations on the airline during this period when liquidity is severely challenged.” With this approach, SIA says it can “treat the entire capital raised as equity”, which will strengthen its balance sheet “rather than burden [it] with high levels of debt that may restrict our ability to raise further financing in the future”. The group states that it is not clear how the airline industry will recover, and which segments or markets will first see growth, but expects its portfolio strategy to “give us the right products to meet the demand when it returns” while its global network will allow it to “flexibly deploy capacity to meet demand from different markets as air travel returns”. “The rights [issue of mandatory convertible bonds] also provides SIA the option to redeem it with internal cashflows, or refinance through other financing sources when markets recover.” For now, SIA has cut its scheduled capacity by 96% while the outlook remains murky. “SIA expects to operate a significantly reduced capacity for the foreseeable future until global travel restrictions and border controls are progressively lifted, and the demand for air travel begins to pick up once again,” the group says. “However, it is not clear when this will happen.”",4,264,8.0,0.2126,"government, uk, carrier, business, state, share, south, airway, financial, plan","['sia', 'set', 'aside', 'plan', 'raise', 'issue', 'equity', 'mandatory', 'convertible', 'bond', 'purchase', 'related', 'payment', 'rationale', 'purchase', 'remains', 'valid', 'even', 'present', 'scenario', 'give', 'enable', 'sia', 'proceed', 'adoption', 'newgeneration', 'replacement', 'exist', 'fleet', 'growth', 'generation', 'provide', 'enhance', 'travel', 'experience', 'customer', 'provide', 'well', 'operating', 'efficiency', 'low', 'emission', 'say', 'response', 'question', 'security', 'investor', 'association', 'singapore', 'sias', 'disclose', 'singapore', 'exchange', 'fleet', 'data', 'expect', 'receive', 'rest', 'another', 'quarter', 'comprise', 'family', 'along', 'jet', 'yet', 'recertified', 'follow', 'global', 'ground', 'march', 'sia', 'say', 'believe', 'proceeds', 'right', 'issue', 'allow', 'u', 'meet', 'liquidity', 'operational', 'requirement', 'include', 'operating', 'cash', 'flow', 'need', 'capital', 'expenditure', 'requirement', 'fix', 'obligation', 'good', 'part', 'financial', 'utilise', 'operating', 'cash', 'flow', 'funding', 'fix', 'cost', 'operating', 'expense', 'incur', 'period', 'reduce', 'operation', 'subsequent', 'recovery', 'period', 'remain', 'service', 'debt', 'contractual', 'payment', 'furthermore', 'additional', 'mandatory', 'convertible', 'bond', 'may', 'issue', 'within', 'period', 'egm', 'april', 'provide', 'u', 'additional', 'liquidity', 'crisis', 'extends', 'prolong', 'period', 'provide', 'u', 'resource', 'capitalise', 'opportunity', 'may', 'arise', 'follow', 'abatement', 'coronavirus', 'pandemic', 'position', 'strength', 'position', 'u', 'growth', 'soon', 'ongoing', 'crisis', 'response', 'sia', 'opt', 'equity', 'rather', 'debt', 'financing', 'say', 'become', 'difficult', 'tap', 'debt', 'capital', 'market', 'continue', 'explore', 'traditional', 'funding', 'channel', 'secure', 'financing', 'saleandleaseback', 'transaction', 'opportunity', 'remain', 'limited', 'current', 'climate', 'possible', 'raise', 'similar', 'quantum', 'channel', 'moreover', 'transaction', 'create', 'cash', 'outflow', 'obligation', 'period', 'liquidity', 'severely', 'approach', 'sia', 'say', 'treat', 'entire', 'capital', 'raise', 'equity', 'strengthen', 'balance', 'sheet', 'rather', 'burden', 'high', 'level', 'debt', 'may', 'restrict', 'ability', 'raise', 'far', 'financing', 'future', 'state', 'clear', 'industry', 'recover', 'segment', 'market', 'see', 'growth', 'expect', 'portfolio', 'strategy', 'give', 'u', 'right', 'product', 'meet', 'demand', 'return', 'global', 'network', 'allow', 'flexibly', 'deploy', 'capacity', 'meet', 'demand', 'different', 'market', 'travel', 'return', 'right', 'issue', 'mandatory', 'convertible', 'bond', 'provide', 'sia', 'option', 'redeem', 'internal', 'cashflows', 'refinance', 'financing', 'source', 'market', 'sia', 'cut', 'schedule', 'capacity', 'outlook', 'remains', 'murky', 'sia', 'expect', 'operate', 'significantly', 'reduce', 'capacity', 'foreseeable', 'future', 'global', 'travel', 'restriction', 'border', 'control', 'progressively', 'lift', 'demand', 'travel', 'begin', 'pick', 'say', 'however', 'clear', 'happen']"
"Singapore Airlines (SIA) will shift four Airbus A380s to long-term storage at Alice Springs airport in central Australia. The first of four double-deckers arrived on 26 April, according to a Facebook post by Alice Springs airport; the jets will be stored at Asia Pacific Aircraft Storage. On 23 March, SIA announced that it would ground 138 of 147 aircraft - including 19 A380s - owing to the collapse in passenger demand stemming from the coronavirus crisis. The majority of SIA's fleet is stored at Singapore's Changi airport, alongside aircraft from its Silkair and Scoot units. The dry, desert conditions of Alice Springs are a better for storing aircraft than the humid, tropical environment of Southeast Asia. According to Cirium fleets data, just two of the 66 A380s operated by Asia-Pacific airlines are in service. These aircraft are operated by China Southern Airlines.

"Vietnam's domestic air travel market is taking tentative steps back to normality with the country's airlines adding flights as the coronavirus pandemic ebbs. Vietnam Airlines has started operating four to six flights daily on the key Hanoi-Ho Chi Minh City route, with this to grow to 11 flights daily in May. The mainline carrier's services will be supplemented by two daily services by low-cost unit Jetstar Pacific. Low-cost rival VietJet is also operating six daily flights on the Hanoi-Ho Chi Minh route. In addition, both airlines will resume limited services to other cities, such as Da Nang. The airlines announced the moves as Vietnam emerges from a countrywide lockdown owing to the coronavirus crisis. Vietnam, which reacted early to the pandemic that originated in China, has been relatively unscathed. Government statistics suggest it has suffered just 270 cases. In all, the three carriers should operate 17 flights daily on the route in May. Cirium schedules data indicates that in May 2019 the country's carriers operated roughly 65 daily services on the Hanoi-Ho Chi Minh City route, one of the Asia-Pacific's busiest. Highlighting coronavirus concerns, the aircraft will be disinfected after every flight. Aircraft crews will have face masks, gloves, goggles and alcohol wipes. Passengers are required to wear masks throughout the flight. The country's third carrier, Bamboo Airways, has said that it still intends to grow in 2020, but to 40 aircraft instead of the 50 planned. Cirium fleets data suggests it has two aircraft in service and 22 in storage. The airlines have said that they will await developments regarding the eventual resumption of international flights.

"Indonesia has banned commercial flying from 24 April until 1 June, in a bid to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. The ban on commercial flying was part of a larger travel ban imposed by the Indonesian government on Indonesians seeking to travel back to their hometowns to mark the end of the Islamic fasting month of Ramadan, which falls on 24 May. The country's director general for civil aviation, Novie Riyanto, was quoted in a 23 April CNBC Indonesia report as saying that the ban would apply to both scheduled and charter flights operating to domestic and international destinations. He adds that exceptions would only apply to cargo, medical, and repatriation flights, as well as flights carrying state leaders and their representatives, and those of international organisations. Indonesia's air navigation service will continue to operate, and airports will handle flights that remain in service. Although the ban on commercial flying was meant to start today, the transport ministry decided to grant a one-day dispensation for domestic flights to operate, citing the need to allow carriers to fulfil their obligations to passengers who had booked tickets before the ban was announced. It is also unclear if the ban will be extended beyond 1 June, and into this year's Hajj season. The start of Hajj travel this year is likely to start at the end of June or early July, pending approvals from Saudi Arabia. Cirium schedules data show that in April, seven Indonesian carriers offered 9.45 million seats on domestic services, a 4.8% decline year-on-year. The number of seats on international services fell by 82% to just 139,000 seats. The decline in domestic seat capacity was driven by capacity reductions from Garuda Indonesia, Citilink, Indonesia AirAsia, Sriwijaya Air and Wings Air. On the other hand, Batik Air grew its capacity by 29% while Lion Air added 18% more seats in April. On international flights, both Indonesia AirAsia and Wings Air halted their overseas flying, while the remaining five carriers reduced their seat capacity by up to 93%. Lion Air Group did not respond to Cirium's request for comment on the ban. Indonesia AirAsia had suspended operations since 1 April, citing impact of the coronavirus pandemic. In its outlook for the next six months, Garuda said it expects conditions will deteriorate as there is a lack of clarity as to when the pandemic will end.

"Embraer has accused Boeing of deliberately wrecking the proposed tie-up between the two aircraft manufacturers, and is set to launch a damages claim over the collapsed deal. While it acknowledges Boeing's notice of termination of the master transaction agreement – which set out plans for joint commercial and military aircraft ventures – the Brazilian company argues that Boeing has sought to “avoid its commitments” to the deal and “wrongfully terminated” the tie-up. It says it will “pursue all remedies” against Boeing, alleging damages incurred by the decision. “We believe Boeing has engaged in a systematic pattern of delay and repeated violations of the [agreement] because of its unwillingness to complete the transaction,” says Embraer, in an unusually strong response to the Boeing decision.  Embraer insists it is in “full compliance” with its obligations under the agreement and had satisfied “all conditions required” by the crucial 24 April deadline – in contrast to Boeing's claim that Embraer “did not satisfy” the necessary conditions. The Brazilian firm believes Boeing – under pressure financially from the 737 Max grounding – has been seeking to abandon the tie-up, part of which would have involved its paying $4.2 billion for an 80% shareholding in Embraer's commercial aircraft business. Embraer says it has managed to overcome “difficult moments” during its evolution, and says: “That's exactly what we are going to do again.” Boeing has responded to Embraer's accusations simply by saying it “believes it is within its rights to terminate the agreement”. “We exercised those rights when Embraer failed to satisfy the necessary conditions within the agreement,” it adds.",4,268,0.0,0.2469,"order, business, jet, delivery, production, customer, deliver, commercial, quarter, include","['embraer', 'accuse', 'deliberately', 'wreck', 'propose', 'tieup', 'manufacturer', 'set', 'launch', 'damage', 'claim', 'collapse', 'deal', 'acknowledges', 'notice', 'termination', 'master', 'transaction', 'agreement', 'set', 'plan', 'joint', 'commercial', 'military', 'venture', 'brazilian', 'argues', 'sought', 'avoid', 'commitment', 'deal', 'wrongfully', 'terminate', 'tieup', 'say', 'pursue', 'remedy', 'allege', 'damage', 'incur', 'decision', 'believe', 'engage', 'systematic', 'pattern', 'delay', 'repeat', 'violation', 'agreement', 'unwillingness', 'complete', 'transaction', 'say', 'embraer', 'unusually', 'strong', 'response', 'decision', 'embraer', 'insists', 'full', 'compliance', 'obligation', 'agreement', 'satisfied', 'condition', 'require', 'crucial', 'april', 'deadline', 'contrast', 'claim', 'embraer', 'satisfy', 'necessary', 'condition', 'brazilian', 'firm', 'believe', 'pressure', 'financially', 'ground', 'seek', 'abandon', 'tieup', 'part', 'involve', 'pay', 'shareholding', 'embraer', 'commercial', 'business', 'embraer', 'say', 'manage', 'overcome', 'difficult', 'moment', 'evolution', 'say', 'exactly', 'go', 'respond', 'embraer', 'accusation', 'simply', 'say', 'believe', 'within', 'right', 'terminate', 'agreement', 'exercise', 'right', 'embraer', 'fail', 'satisfy', 'necessary', 'condition', 'within', 'agreement', 'add']"
"Hong Kong authorities have warned Boeing 787 operators of possible adverse autopilot behaviour during localiser capture at the city's international airport, after the latest in a string of incidents involving the type. A newly-issued NOTAM instructs carriers to check a Boeing flight crew operations bulletin referring to “anomalies” in localiser capture and possible misbehavior by the autopilot flight-director system, particularly during ILS approaches to runways 25R and 25L. It states that the issue can lead to “proximity to high grounds”, adding that – if it doubt – crews should climb back to minimum sector altitude and conduct a missed approach. The NOTAM follows an incident on 21 April involving an Air Canada 787-9, arriving from Vancouver, which had been cleared for an ILS approach to 25L. Transportation Safety Board of Canada says the crew contacted air traffic control after reaching the waypoint LOTUS, located about 15nm from the threshold, and reported being established on the ILS. After controllers advised the crew to switch to the Hong Kong tower frequency, they observed the aircraft “overshooting the localiser” of 25L and descending to 3,900ft – below the minimum sector altitude of 4,300ft. Controllers contacted the crew to warn of terrain and the pilots corrected the flightpath to re-intercept the ILS. The crew reported receiving a “false capture” of the ILS, says the safety board, which adds that the pilots had visual contact with both the terrain and the airport at the time. The safety board indicates that only four occupants were on board the 787 (C-FNOH), suggesting it was operating a special freight supply service. Boeing has been working on a resolution to the issue, which has affected several 787 flights into Hong Kong including four between July and October last year involving aircraft operated by Virgin Atlantic, Ethiopian Airlines, and Etihad Airways.",4,269,7.0,0.4042,"crew, runway, inquiry, land, approach, accident, investigator, captain, incident, pilot","['hong', 'kong', 'authority', 'warn', 'operator', 'possible', 'adverse', 'autopilot', 'behaviour', 'localiser', 'capture', 'city', 'international', 'airport', 'late', 'string', 'incident', 'involve', 'type', 'newlyissued', 'notam', 'instructs', 'carrier', 'check', 'crew', 'operation', 'bulletin', 'refer', 'anomaly', 'localiser', 'capture', 'possible', 'misbehavior', 'autopilot', 'flightdirector', 'system', 'particularly', 'il', 'approach', 'runway', 'state', 'issue', 'lead', 'proximity', 'high', 'ground', 'add', 'doubt', 'crew', 'climb', 'back', 'minimum', 'sector', 'altitude', 'conduct', 'miss', 'approach', 'notam', 'follow', 'incident', 'april', 'involve', 'canada', 'arrive', 'vancouver', 'clear', 'il', 'approach', 'transportation', 'safety', 'board', 'canada', 'say', 'crew', 'contact', 'traffic', 'control', 'reach', 'waypoint', 'lotus', 'locate', 'threshold', 'report', 'establish', 'il', 'controller', 'advise', 'crew', 'switch', 'hong', 'kong', 'tower', 'frequency', 'observe', 'overshoot', 'localiser', 'descend', 'minimum', 'sector', 'altitude', 'controller', 'contact', 'crew', 'warn', 'terrain', 'pilot', 'correct', 'flightpath', 'reintercept', 'il', 'crew', 'report', 'receive', 'false', 'capture', 'il', 'say', 'safety', 'board', 'add', 'pilot', 'visual', 'contact', 'terrain', 'airport', 'safety', 'board', 'indicates', 'occupant', 'board', 'cfnoh', 'suggest', 'operating', 'special', 'freight', 'supply', 'service', 'work', 'resolution', 'issue', 'affected', 'several', 'hong', 'kong', 'include', 'july', 'october', 'involve', 'operate', 'virgin', 'atlantic', 'ethiopian', 'etihad', 'airway']"
"Older aircraft types are likely to be the biggest casualties as the airline industry begins recovering from the coronavirus pandemic, despite the prevailing low cost of fuel. That is the view of analysts at aviation consultancy Ascend by Cirium, speaking during a company webinar this week. “Four-engined widebody jets” are likely to bear the brunt of the crisis, says Ascend by Cirium's global head of consultancy, Rob Morris. “The passenger [Boeing] 747 is probably at the end of its line. The [Airbus] A340-600 is also threatened.” Morris adds that the Airbus A380 “has shown itself to be remarkably inflexible. So, that's put it in a difficult position. Maybe mid-life single-aisles are quite threatened as well.”  Four-engined widebodies like the passenger Boeing 747 are endangered species, says Ascend's Morris Ascend's head of valuations, George Dimitroff says mid-life twin-aisle aircraft like the A330, 767 and 777 Classic are “probably more threatened, because as traffic returns we see single-aisles return to service first, followed by twin-aisles.” Both analysts believe airlines should resist the temptation to take advantage of the current cheap oil situation by returning older, inefficient types to service rather than moving to newer more-expensive metal. “We don't know how long the low oil price is going to stay as low as it is,” says Dimitroff. “If airlines can get financing...then they have an opportunity to future-proof themselves now if they can acquire new-technology, fuel-efficient aircraft at a low-enough price, because all values are coming down [as a result of the pandemic].” Morris believes that despite the current financial crisis, the industry must also not ignore its commitment to continuously improve its environmental credentials. “At the start of the year, before COVID-19, we thought the environment was going to be the issue of the year. That doesn't change just because we have a globally threatened economy,” says Morris. “As airlines discuss recovery packages with governments, we're already starting to hear environmentalists chipping in, quite correctly, about the fact that we're just creating this potential subsidy for airlines that, with low oil prices, might think about keeping older aircraft for longer. “Newer aircraft are more 15% efficient. So there's the opportunity to future-proof from an environmental perspective too,” adds Morris. He believes any influence of cheap oil on airline strategy is a bit of an anomaly at the moment: “Many airlines are hedged and not benefiting from oil prices right now.” ",4,270,9.0,0.4712,"industry, crisis, demand, coronavirus, global, iata, market, level, cargo, expect","['old', 'type', 'likely', 'big', 'casualty', 'industry', 'begin', 'recover', 'coronavirus', 'pandemic', 'despite', 'prevail', 'low', 'cost', 'fuel', 'view', 'analyst', 'consultancy', 'ascend', 'speak', 'webinar', 'week', 'fourengined', 'widebody', 'jet', 'likely', 'bear', 'brunt', 'crisis', 'say', 'ascend', 'global', 'head', 'consultancy', 'rob', 'morris', 'passenger', 'probably', 'end', 'line', 'morris', 'add', 'remarkably', 'inflexible', 'put', 'difficult', 'position', 'maybe', 'midlife', 'singleaisles', 'quite', 'threaten', 'fourengined', 'widebodies', 'like', 'passenger', 'endanger', 'specie', 'say', 'ascend', 'morris', 'ascend', 'head', 'valuation', 'george', 'dimitroff', 'say', 'midlife', 'twinaisle', 'like', 'classic', 'probably', 'threaten', 'traffic', 'return', 'see', 'singleaisles', 'return', 'service', 'follow', 'analyst', 'believe', 'resist', 'temptation', 'take', 'advantage', 'current', 'cheap', 'oil', 'situation', 'return', 'old', 'inefficient', 'type', 'service', 'rather', 'move', 'newer', 'moreexpensive', 'metal', 'know', 'long', 'low', 'oil', 'price', 'go', 'stay', 'low', 'say', 'dimitroff', 'get', 'financing', 'opportunity', 'futureproof', 'acquire', 'newtechnology', 'fuelefficient', 'lowenough', 'price', 'value', 'come', 'result', 'pandemic', 'morris', 'believe', 'despite', 'current', 'financial', 'crisis', 'industry', 'must', 'ignore', 'commitment', 'continuously', 'improve', 'environmental', 'credential', 'start', 'coronavirus', 'thought', 'environment', 'go', 'issue', 'change', 'globally', 'threaten', 'economy', 'say', 'morris', 'discus', 'recovery', 'package', 'government', 'already', 'start', 'hear', 'environmentalist', 'chip', 'quite', 'correctly', 'fact', 'create', 'potential', 'subsidy', 'low', 'oil', 'price', 'might', 'think', 'keep', 'old', 'longer', 'newer', 'efficient', 'opportunity', 'futureproof', 'environmental', 'perspective', 'add', 'morris', 'believe', 'influence', 'cheap', 'oil', 'strategy', 'bit', 'anomaly', 'moment', 'many', 'hedge', 'benefiting', 'oil', 'price', 'right']"
"Air Deccan is in talks with an aircraft manufacturer as the Indian carrier prepares to restart operations once the coroanvirus crisis stabilises, chief executive Arun Kumar Singh has disclosed. The carrier is in the process of returning its two 18-year-old Beechcraft Beech 1900Ds to their lessor, having already served notice of lease termination, Singh tells Cirium. He declined to name the lessor. The original incarnation of Air Deccan was India's largest low-cost carrier. Singh adds the lockdown has made it difficult to return the aircraft. The airline's Beechcrafts – which, according to Cirium fleets data, formerly flew with a now-defunct subsidiary of Air New Zealand– are described by Singh as “very old and very tired ”. “We have taken this as an opportunity for newer aircraft,” he adds. “We are talking to an OEM, but nothing has been signed yet so I can't disclose anything.” Pressed on whether he is talking to Airbus or Boeing, Singh says he is not talking with either of them, and that the type he is looking at is a “smaller commuter aircraft”. On 5 April, Air Deccan– which has history dating back to 2003, and was once a part of ill-fated Kingfisher Airlines– announced that it was suspending operations until further notice. It was the first Indian carrier to cease operations amid the coronavirus pandemic. All employees were put on “sabbatical” without pay, though Singh says they will be given “right of first refusal” to rejoin the company once it starts operations again. “We took a very early call in doing that,” he says, referring to management's decision to shutter the airline. “I sat down with shareholders and we knew which direction this was going to go. We sat down and took a conscious call and took a very quick decision that coronavirus was going to stay for the next three to six months. “The question we had to ask was could we sustain ourselves with no revenues coming in? If we could somehow subsidise the aviation business from my shareholder's other businesses – but the problem is all other business have come to a halt. We can't keep pumping in money when there is no light at the end of the tunnel. Look what happened to Virgin Australia. The situation compared to other Indian carriers is not anyway extra bad for us; it's just we saw that coming quickly.” The airline got off to a rocky start in 2003, having to abandon its inaugural flight carrying Indian dignitaries due to an engine fire during taxi. Despite that, it managed to grow its fleet and route network, and in 2008 completed a merger with now-defunct Kingfisher Airlines. Under its new owner, Air Deccan was rechristened Kingfisher Red, but its high operating costs and low yields proved to be a drag on Kingfisher. In 2011Kingfisher Airlines, which not long after went belly-up, decided to phase outKingfisher Red. Air Deccan founder GR Gopinath, who has been dubbed “the man who got India's middle class to fly”, managed to retain the airline's name by registering for it soon after the rebranding, Forbes India reports. Air Deccan made a comeback in December 2017 when it was granted a flying permit from India's civil aviation regulator to conduct flights under the country's UDAN regional connectivity scheme, Business Standard reported at the time. The first three routes were from Mumbai to Nashik, Pune and Jalgaon, according to Forbes India.",4,271,10.0,0.2516,"international, authority, civil, state, investigation, case, add, january, airasia, crash","['deccan', 'talk', 'manufacturer', 'indian', 'carrier', 'prepares', 'restart', 'operation', 'coroanvirus', 'crisis', 'stabilises', 'chief', 'executive', 'arun', 'kumar', 'singh', 'disclose', 'carrier', 'process', 'return', 'beechcraft', 'beech', 'lessor', 'already', 'serve', 'notice', 'lease', 'termination', 'singh', 'tell', 'decline', 'name', 'lessor', 'original', 'incarnation', 'deccan', 'india', 'large', 'lowcost', 'carrier', 'singh', 'add', 'lockdown', 'make', 'difficult', 'return', 'beechcrafts', 'accord', 'fleet', 'data', 'formerly', 'flew', 'nowdefunct', 'subsidiary', 'described', 'singh', 'old', 'tire', 'take', 'opportunity', 'newer', 'add', 'talk', 'oem', 'nothing', 'sign', 'yet', 'ca', 'disclose', 'press', 'whether', 'talk', 'singh', 'say', 'talk', 'either', 'type', 'look', 'small', 'commuter', 'april', 'history', 'date', 'back', 'part', 'illfated', 'kingfisher', 'announce', 'suspend', 'operation', 'far', 'notice', 'indian', 'carrier', 'cease', 'operation', 'amid', 'coronavirus', 'pandemic', 'employee', 'put', 'sabbatical', 'without', 'pay', 'though', 'singh', 'say', 'give', 'right', 'refusal', 'rejoin', 'start', 'operation', 'take', 'early', 'call', 'say', 'refer', 'management', 'decision', 'shutter', 'sat', 'shareholder', 'knew', 'direction', 'go', 'go', 'sat', 'take', 'conscious', 'call', 'take', 'quick', 'decision', 'coronavirus', 'go', 'stay', 'next', 'month', 'question', 'ask', 'sustain', 'revenue', 'come', 'somehow', 'subsidise', 'business', 'shareholder', 'business', 'problem', 'business', 'come', 'halt', 'ca', 'keep', 'pump', 'money', 'light', 'end', 'tunnel', 'look', 'happen', 'virgin', 'australia', 'situation', 'compare', 'indian', 'carrier', 'anyway', 'extra', 'bad', 'u', 'saw', 'come', 'get', 'rocky', 'start', 'abandon', 'inaugural', 'carry', 'indian', 'dignitary', 'due', 'engine', 'fire', 'taxi', 'despite', 'manage', 'grow', 'fleet', 'route', 'network', 'complete', 'merger', 'nowdefunct', 'kingfisher', 'owner', 'deccan', 'rechristened', 'kingfisher', 'red', 'high', 'operating', 'cost', 'low', 'yield', 'prove', 'drag', 'kingfisher', 'long', 'go', 'bellyup', 'decide', 'phase', 'outkingfisher', 'red', 'deccan', 'founder', 'gr', 'gopinath', 'dubbed', 'man', 'get', 'india', 'middle', 'class', 'fly', 'manage', 'retain', 'name', 'register', 'soon', 'rebranding', 'forbes', 'india', 'report', 'deccan', 'make', 'comeback', 'december', 'grant', 'fly', 'permit', 'india', 'civil', 'regulator', 'conduct', 'country', 'udan', 'regional', 'connectivity', 'scheme', 'business', 'standard', 'report', 'route', 'mumbai', 'nashik', 'pune', 'jalgaon', 'accord', 'forbes', 'india']"
"African budget operator Fastjet Group has sold a dormant Embraer ERJ-145 to Solenta Aviation in a deal to reduce debts owed for maintenance work within Fastjet's Zimbabwean division. The ERJ-145 had been used for Fastjet's operations in Mozambique before the company suspended services in the country last year. Fastjet Group says this aircraft had remained idle, and in need of heavy maintenance, following the suspension. After the heavy maintenance was completed, the aircraft was sold to Solenta Aviation for $2.2 million on 9 March. These proceeds – in the form of a credit note – have been used to offset part of a $3.6 million debt owed to Solenta for aircraft maintenance and support to Fastjet's Zimbabwean arm, reducing the amount owed to $1.4 million by 31 March.

"Airbus has reportedly backed out of a joint venture with Thai Airways to build a new MRO campus at Thailand's U-Tapao airport. A report from local newspaper The Nation cites Thai Airways Technical executive vice president Cherdphan Chotikhun as saying that the European airframer had withdrawn from the cooperation as it was affected by the coronavirus crisis. According to Chotikhun, Airbus did not deliver its proposal for the new MRO campus by 20 April, the stipulated deadline. As a result, Thai Airways would now have to seek “new solutions”, or return the land to the Thai navy, which owns the land. Chotikhun was reported as saying that Thai will seek new partners – through a bidding process – as the MRO project was critical to its turnaround plans. In response to FlightGlobal's queries, Airbus did not confirm nor deny the report. However, it says it is in discussion with all parties. “We are in discussions with our partners in Thailand regarding the most suitable way forward for all parties. The content of discussions with partners and customers alike, remain confidential,” the airframer says. Thai Airways confirms that Airbus did not ”present its proposal within the deadline”, but was unable to comment on the new timeline of the project. The MRO campus joint venture is part of the Thai government's plans to develop an aerospace hub in the country's eastern seaboard. The joint venture with Airbus was split 50-50 between both parties, although the Thai government will invest in it. The 34ha (84 acres) facility was slated to open in July 2022. Its focus areas will include heavy and line maintenance, paint work, wheel and brake maintenance, as well as component overhaul.

"Israeli flag-carrier El Al has reached a sale-and-leaseback agreement with an unidentified foreign company covering three Boeing 737-800s. The airline, which has been seeking to shore up its finances, says it signed a memorandum of understanding for the transaction on 23 April. El Al has not identified the specific airframes involved but says they were manufactured in 2009. Cirium fleets data lists the airline as having three owned 737-800s from that year – 4X-EKH, 4X-EKJ and 4X-EKL – which were all originally ordered by Air Europa before being delivered new to the Israeli operator. The aircraft will be sold for a total of $76 million and leased back to the carrier for eight years. El Al says it will deposit $21 million of this sum with the buyer in order to cover maintenance and refurbishment work during the lease period. About 75% of this deposit, it adds, will be “gradually” returned to the airline by the end of 2021, depending on the level of repair required for the jets' CFM International CFM56 engines. The balance will be repaid by 2026. El Al says it is carrying out the sale as part of measures to deal with the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on its financial position. But it points out that the 737 transaction is subject to a number of conditions set out in the memorandum, including obtaining support from the government and the release of the aircraft from current liens. “Completion of the transaction under [these and other] conditions is uncertain at this time,” it says, adding that completion would be recognised in accounts through a capital pre-tax loss of $3.7 million.",4,274,8.0,0.2808,"government, uk, carrier, business, state, share, south, airway, financial, plan","['israeli', 'flagcarrier', 'el', 'al', 'reach', 'saleandleaseback', 'agreement', 'unidentified', 'foreign', 'cover', 'seek', 'shore', 'finance', 'say', 'sign', 'memorandum', 'understand', 'transaction', 'april', 'el', 'al', 'identify', 'specific', 'airframe', 'involve', 'say', 'manufacture', 'fleet', 'data', 'list', 'originally', 'order', 'europa', 'deliver', 'israeli', 'operator', 'sell', 'total', 'lease', 'back', 'carrier', 'el', 'al', 'say', 'deposit', 'sum', 'buyer', 'order', 'cover', 'maintenance', 'refurbishment', 'work', 'lease', 'period', 'deposit', 'add', 'gradually', 'return', 'end', 'depend', 'level', 'repair', 'require', 'jet', 'cfm', 'international', 'engine', 'balance', 'repaid', 'el', 'al', 'say', 'carry', 'sale', 'part', 'measure', 'deal', 'impact', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'financial', 'position', 'point', 'transaction', 'subject', 'number', 'condition', 'set', 'memorandum', 'include', 'obtain', 'support', 'government', 'release', 'current', 'lien', 'completion', 'transaction', 'condition', 'uncertain', 'say', 'add', 'completion', 'recognise', 'account', 'capital', 'pretax', 'loss']"
"More carriers in the Asia-Pacific region could fall as a result of the coronavirus crisis, if governments fail to step in with relief measures. Highlighting the “worsening” impact of the pandemic on carriers in the region, airline body IATA also identified eight countries which are most at risk. These countries include South Korea, Malaysia, Japan, Sri Lanka, as well as Thailand. They are estimated to see the highest revenue impact from the outbreak, according to IATA's individual country impact study. Reiterating calls for more government assistance, IATA regional vice president for Asia-Pacific Conrad Clifford says: “The situation is deteriorating. Airlines are in survival mode. They face a liquidity crisis with a US$61 billion cash burn in the second quarter.” He warns that “there will be more casualties if governments do not step in urgently to ensure airlines have sufficient cash flow to tide them over this period”. The body is calling for direct financial support, loans, loan guarantees, as well as tax relief measures. Clifford's comments come days after Virgin Australia entered voluntary administration, the first Asia-Pacific carrier to take action amid the coronavirus crisis. In its latest analysis on the financial impact of the coronavirus outbreak, IATA forecast a global airline passenger revenue drop of $314 billion this year. Asia-Pacific carriers will make up the largest proportion of this revenue hit – $113 billion, up from $88 billion in a March estimate.

"IATA has increased its estimate of the cost of the coronavirus crisis to European airlines, and now believes it will cut sector earnings 2020 earnings by more than half. The association is predicting an annual revenue reduction of 55% against 2019, a hit of $89 billion. This represents an increase of $13 billion against its estimate from 24 March, and assumes severe travel restrictions for three months followed by a gradual lifting of measures. This would result in a $452 billion impact on the wider economy, IATA warns. “We are entering a very damaged phase for European air connectivity,” says IATA's regional vice-president for Europe, Rafael Schvartzman. He notes that at the start of the crisis IATA estimated that European airlines had on average just two months of liquidity available. Since then many airlines have obtained financial assistance, but not all have been able to do so. Hence, it is “vital that governments accelerate plans to support the industry”, adds Schvartzman. As well as financial assistance, IATA is urgently requesting greater flexibility on refunds. Schvartzman notes that European airlines owe $10 billion back to customers for cancelled flights. While IATA is not disputing the need to reimburse customers, it notes that to do so in seven days, as currently stipulated, is placing airlines under extreme financial stress as they are desperate to shore up cash reserves. “We know this is controversial, but we need to look at the bigger picture.” Airlines also need help to preparing for a return to the skies. This, IATA argues, should include confidence-building measures, harmonised global standards, and a recognition that governments must draw on airlines' operational expertise. There should also be a clear exit strategy from any additional safety measures that may be mandated. “The world will rely on airlines and air connectivity to restore the global economy,” Schvartzman says. “A successful restart of the industry will be crucial. To help with that, IATA is hosting a series of regional summits to bring governments and key stakeholders together, to maximise the chances of an orderly restart.” Asked about ticket pricing – following IATA director general Alexandre de Juniac's recent comment that cheap travel would be “over” if social distancing were enforced on aircraft – Schvartzman notes: “If you are limiting capacity, then that will affect pricing.” He adds that given the stresses being placed on the industry, some level of consolidation is inevitable.",4,276,9.0,0.3603,"industry, crisis, demand, coronavirus, global, iata, market, level, cargo, expect","['iata', 'increase', 'estimate', 'cost', 'coronavirus', 'crisis', 'european', 'believe', 'cut', 'sector', 'earnings', 'earnings', 'half', 'association', 'predict', 'annual', 'revenue', 'reduction', 'hit', 'represent', 'increase', 'estimate', 'march', 'assumes', 'severe', 'travel', 'restriction', 'month', 'follow', 'gradual', 'lift', 'measure', 'result', 'impact', 'wider', 'economy', 'iata', 'warns', 'enter', 'damage', 'phase', 'european', 'connectivity', 'say', 'iata', 'regional', 'vicepresident', 'europe', 'rafael', 'schvartzman', 'note', 'start', 'crisis', 'iata', 'estimate', 'european', 'average', 'month', 'liquidity', 'available', 'since', 'many', 'obtain', 'financial', 'assistance', 'able', 'hence', 'vital', 'government', 'accelerate', 'plan', 'support', 'industry', 'add', 'schvartzman', 'well', 'financial', 'assistance', 'iata', 'urgently', 'request', 'great', 'flexibility', 'refund', 'schvartzman', 'note', 'european', 'owe', 'back', 'customer', 'cancel', 'iata', 'dispute', 'need', 'reimburse', 'customer', 'note', 'day', 'currently', 'stipulate', 'place', 'extreme', 'financial', 'stress', 'desperate', 'shore', 'cash', 'reserve', 'know', 'controversial', 'need', 'look', 'big', 'need', 'help', 'prepare', 'return', 'sky', 'iata', 'argues', 'include', 'confidencebuilding', 'measure', 'harmonise', 'global', 'standard', 'recognition', 'government', 'must', 'draw', 'operational', 'expertise', 'clear', 'exit', 'strategy', 'additional', 'safety', 'measure', 'may', 'mandate', 'world', 'rely', 'connectivity', 'restore', 'global', 'economy', 'schvartzman', 'say', 'successful', 'restart', 'industry', 'crucial', 'help', 'iata', 'host', 'series', 'regional', 'summit', 'bring', 'government', 'key', 'stakeholder', 'together', 'maximise', 'chance', 'orderly', 'ask', 'ticket', 'pricing', 'follow', 'iata', 'director', 'general', 'alexandre', 'de', 'juniac', 'recent', 'comment', 'cheap', 'travel', 'social', 'distance', 'enforce', 'schvartzman', 'note', 'limit', 'capacity', 'affect', 'add', 'give', 'stress', 'place', 'industry', 'level', 'consolidation', 'inevitable']"
"Garuda Indonesiahas outlined the measures undertaken in light of uncertainties caused by the coronavirus pandemic. In response to a stock exchange query made on 16 April, the airline says it has begun negotiations with lessors to delay payment on leased aircraft and to extend their lease periods. It will renegotiate with external parties on its obligations that are due, while seeking financing support or loans from financial institutions. The airline has embarked on a cost-efficiency programme to reduce its expenses by 15-20%, and is seeking some form of government support. It has also “optimised” the number of flights it operates and the capacity deployed, by operating cargo-only and repatriation flights, closing unprofitable routes, delaying the delivery of four Airbus A330-900neos planned for this year. It also plans to grow its international hubs of Amsterdam and Japan by taking advantage of interline services with other carriers. In its outlook for the next six months, the carrier expects that conditions will deteriorate, as there is a lack of clarity as to when the pandemic will end. It pointed out that the months of May and June is the peak season for travel as it coincides with the end of Ramadan and Indonesia's school holidays. It may also be unable to operate Hajj flights this year, which falls in the July-August period. Garuda adds that it expects to see a 33% decline in its total revenue for the first quarter of 2020, due to a decline in its passenger segment revenue, as well as falling passenger numbers and ticket prices. It notes that the passenger segment contributes more than 80% of its total revenue, and the fall in passenger numbers comes after Indonesia implemented measures to limit the spread of the coronavirus outbreak. The country's weakening economy has also impacted purchasing power. In 2019, Garuda posted an operating profit of $147 million, a turnaround from 2018's $199 million operating loss.

"Lufthansa Group is in talks with the home governments of its various airlines over financing support after revealing it expects to post a €1.2 billion ($1.3 billion) adjusted EBIT loss for the first quarter of 2020 with deeper losses to follow in the second quarter. In a trading update Lufthansa Group says preliminary results show its first quarter revenues were down 18% to €6.4 billion - and fell by almost half to €1.4 billion in March, as the coronavirus spread through Europe. It notes that cost-cutting measures could only partially offset the slump in revenues, resulting in the group adjusted EBIT loss for the three months ending March of “around” €1.2 billion. That compares to a loss of €336 million in what is traditionally the weakest quarter for the airline. ”The group expects crisis-related asset impairments and the negative development of the value of fuel hedges to have a further significant negative impact on group profit in the quarter,” it adds. Details will be published in its quarterly financial statement, which has been postponed to the second half of May from 30 April. ”At present, it is not possible to foresee when the group airlines will be able to resume flight operations beyond the current repatriation flight schedule,” it adds. ”The group therefore expects a considerably higher operating loss in the second quarter compared to the first quarter.” It says its liquidity currently amounts to around €4.4 billion, noting it has taken financing measures worth €900 million to strengthen its position since March. ”However, in view of the business outlook, existing multi-billion liabilities related to trade payables and refunds of cancelled tickets as well as upcoming repayments of financial liabilities, the group expects a significant decline in liquidity in the coming weeks,” it adds. “The group does not expect to be able to cover the resulting capital requirements with further borrowings on the market,” Lufthansa says. ”The group is therefore in intensive negotiations with the governments of its home countries regarding various financing instruments to sustainably secure the group's solvency in the near future. The management board is confident that the talks will lead to a successful conclusion.”",4,278,3.0,0.2999,"passenger, loss, operating, revenue, traffic, month, increase, capacity, decline, result","['lufthansa', 'talk', 'home', 'government', 'various', 'financing', 'support', 'reveal', 'expect', 'post', 'adjust', 'ebit', 'loss', 'quarter', 'deeper', 'loss', 'follow', 'second', 'quarter', 'trading', 'update', 'lufthansa', 'say', 'preliminary', 'result', 'quarter', 'revenue', 'fell', 'almost', 'half', 'march', 'coronavirus', 'spread', 'europe', 'note', 'costcutting', 'measure', 'partially', 'offset', 'slump', 'revenue', 'result', 'adjust', 'ebit', 'loss', 'month', 'end', 'march', 'around', 'compare', 'loss', 'traditionally', 'weak', 'quarter', 'expect', 'crisisrelated', 'asset', 'impairment', 'negative', 'development', 'value', 'fuel', 'hedge', 'far', 'significant', 'negative', 'impact', 'profit', 'quarter', 'add', 'detail', 'publish', 'quarterly', 'financial', 'statement', 'postpone', 'second', 'half', 'may', 'april', 'present', 'possible', 'foresee', 'able', 'resume', 'operation', 'beyond', 'current', 'repatriation', 'schedule', 'add', 'therefore', 'expect', 'considerably', 'high', 'operating', 'loss', 'second', 'quarter', 'compare', 'say', 'liquidity', 'currently', 'amount', 'around', 'note', 'take', 'financing', 'measure', 'worth', 'strengthen', 'position', 'since', 'march', 'however', 'view', 'business', 'outlook', 'exist', 'multibillion', 'liability', 'related', 'trade', 'payable', 'refund', 'cancel', 'ticket', 'well', 'upcoming', 'repayment', 'financial', 'liability', 'expect', 'significant', 'decline', 'liquidity', 'come', 'week', 'add', 'expect', 'able', 'cover', 'result', 'capital', 'requirement', 'far', 'borrowing', 'market', 'lufthansa', 'say', 'therefore', 'intensive', 'negotiation', 'government', 'home', 'country', 'regard', 'various', 'financing', 'instrument', 'sustainably', 'secure', 'solvency', 'near', 'future', 'management', 'board', 'confident', 'talk', 'lead', 'successful', 'conclusion']"
"AeroVironment has launched its Quantix Recon unmanned air vehicle (UAV), a military variant of its farm surveying drone, on the market. The tail-sitting, vertical-take-off-and-landing UAV requires little to no training to operate, the company says on 22 April. AeroVironment had teased the military variant previously, but after the official announcement the company says it is now available for sale. 1/3 The drone is based on the company's Quantix, a civilian UAV designed to help farmers survey crops. As an agricultural device, the UAV is intended to automatically survey land to help show farmers early signs of crop stress, water issues and estimated crop yields. The Quantix Recon is able to do aerial reconnaissance using automated flight paths and two 18-megapixel cameras that can capture true color and multispectral images, says AeroVironment. For example, the UAV can be tasked to automatically surveil up to 160ha (395 acres) or 10.8nm (20km) linearly underneath its flight path. Though AeroVironment has a collection of our group one UAVs, such as its hand-launched Raven and Puma drones, the company says the Quantix Recon is built with a different purpose. ”Quantix Recon addresses high-resolution mapping and image collection in both full color and multispectral bands, whereas our other Group 1 [UAVs] are designed to deliver real-time, full-motion video,” the company says. ”This high-resolution mapping requires flight controls and image processing, [via particular hardware and software], that are tailored to this distinct mission, creating consistent imagery that is georectified in near real-time onboard the aircraft.” In other words, to stitch together an aerial image of the ground a specially designed UAV is required. Users control the Quantic Recon and view images via a ruggedised Android touch-screen tablet. The drone's flight path and surveillance area are set using waypoints or geofencing on the tablet. AeroVironment says the drone can fly radio silent by relying on its GPS for navigation, something the commercial variant cannot do. The company is touting that feature as a means to avoid detection and radio frequency jamming. Also, the ability to fly disconnected from a radio controller increases the Quantix Recon's range out to 10.8nm for out-and-back flights or 21.6nm for one-way flights, compared to the 1.1nm radio-range limit on the commercial type. The drone has a battery pack that gives 45min of flight endurance. The UAV weighs 2.26kg (5lb). The UAV can fly at altitudes ranging from 150ft to 800ft in winds up to 17kt (32km/h). The company says it is nearly inaudible at 360ft above ground level.",4,279,1.0,0.5853,"test, force, helicopter, fire, system, service, attack, design, usaf, missile","['aerovironment', 'launch', 'quantix', 'recon', 'unmanned', 'vehicle', 'uav', 'military', 'variant', 'farm', 'survey', 'drone', 'market', 'tailsitting', 'verticaltakeoffandlanding', 'uav', 'require', 'little', 'training', 'operate', 'say', 'april', 'aerovironment', 'tease', 'military', 'variant', 'previously', 'official', 'announcement', 'say', 'available', 'sale', 'drone', 'base', 'quantix', 'civilian', 'uav', 'design', 'help', 'farmer', 'survey', 'crop', 'agricultural', 'device', 'uav', 'intend', 'automatically', 'survey', 'land', 'help', 'farmer', 'early', 'sign', 'crop', 'stress', 'water', 'issue', 'estimate', 'crop', 'yield', 'quantix', 'recon', 'able', 'aerial', 'reconnaissance', 'use', 'automate', 'path', 'camera', 'capture', 'true', 'color', 'multispectral', 'image', 'say', 'aerovironment', 'example', 'uav', 'tasked', 'automatically', 'surveil', 'acre', 'linearly', 'underneath', 'path', 'though', 'aerovironment', 'collection', 'uavs', 'handlaunched', 'raven', 'puma', 'drone', 'say', 'quantix', 'recon', 'built', 'different', 'purpose', 'quantix', 'recon', 'address', 'highresolution', 'mapping', 'image', 'collection', 'full', 'color', 'multispectral', 'band', 'whereas', 'uavs', 'design', 'deliver', 'realtime', 'fullmotion', 'video', 'say', 'highresolution', 'mapping', 'require', 'control', 'image', 'processing', 'via', 'particular', 'hardware', 'software', 'tailor', 'distinct', 'mission', 'create', 'consistent', 'imagery', 'georectified', 'near', 'realtime', 'onboard', 'word', 'stitch', 'together', 'aerial', 'image', 'ground', 'specially', 'design', 'uav', 'require', 'user', 'control', 'quantic', 'recon', 'view', 'image', 'via', 'ruggedise', 'android', 'touchscreen', 'tablet', 'drone', 'path', 'surveillance', 'area', 'set', 'use', 'waypoints', 'geofencing', 'tablet', 'aerovironment', 'say', 'drone', 'fly', 'radio', 'silent', 'rely', 'gps', 'navigation', 'something', 'commercial', 'variant', 'tout', 'feature', 'mean', 'avoid', 'detection', 'radio', 'frequency', 'jamming', 'ability', 'fly', 'disconnect', 'radio', 'controller', 'increase', 'quantix', 'recon', 'range', 'outandback', 'oneway', 'compare', 'radiorange', 'limit', 'commercial', 'type', 'drone', 'battery', 'pack', 'give', 'endurance', 'uav', 'weighs', 'uav', 'fly', 'altitude', 'range', 'wind', 'say', 'nearly', 'inaudible', 'ground', 'level']"
"Investigators have found that a Neos Boeing 737-800 continued to descend, unnoticed by the crew, during an aborted landing at Bristol, after a rushed approach meant the go-around altitude was not correctly set. It dipped below 460ft as it travelled over runway 27, with its landing-gear retracted, before the pilots realised the situation and climbed away. The aircraft – arriving from Verona on 1 June last year – had been vectored to a shortened arrival route by approach controllers, which left it above 10,000ft with less than 25nm (46km) to touchdown. With the aircraft high and fast on the approach the crew was unable to switch the autopilot to vertical navigation mode. The pilots instead reverted to 'level change' mode, which carries out an idle-thrust descent to the altitude selected on the mode-control panel – this was set to the approach minima of 1,000ft at the time. As a result of the shortened approach, the aircraft's descent was rushed and became unstable. It sank some 250ft below the designated flightpath, travelling with excessive airspeed, and the tower controller instructed the crew to execute a go-around. The UK Air Accidents Investigation Branch says the 737 was at 1,071ft – about 675ft above ground – and flying at 151kt (280km/h). “The crew found themselves performing a go-around unexpectedly but did not know why they had been required to do so,” it adds. Take-off thrust was engaged and the aircraft began to climb. But the altitude setting in the mode-control panel remained at 1,000ft because the crew had omitted to select the go-around altitude of 3,000ft. Although the 737 initially climbed to just over 1,300ft, the flying pilot manually followed the flight director which attempted to guide the aircraft to level off at 1,000ft. As the jet acquired this altitude, the autothrottle mode changed from 'go-around' to a mode which maintains the aircraft's speed, resulting in the thrust levers being back-driven to a lower power setting and causing the landing-gear warning horn to sound. The crew then adjusted the mode-control panel to set to the correct go-around altitude of 3,000ft. But while this stopped the aircraft trying to level at 1,000ft it also caused a switch to vertical-speed mode. The vertical speed set in the mode-control panel at the time was a descent rate of 300ft/min, and the jet started to lose height as the pilot continued to follow the flight director. “Neither crew member noticed for a significant period that the aircraft was descending during the manoeuvre,” says the inquiry. It points out that the gear-warning horn was still active, owing to the low thrust and flap settings, and was followed by a 'too low, gear' warning from the ground-proximity warning system. The jet was descending for 32s, says the inquiry, reaching a minimum of 457ft above ground after passing almost the entire length of the runway. “The crew then realised that the aircraft was not climbing as expected and adjusted the attitude of the aircraft to begin a climb,” it states, adding that the tower controller almost simultaneously issued an order to climb to 3,000ft. After climbing away the aircraft (I-NEOT) subsequently levelled at 3,000ft and was vectored to another approach, following which it landed without further incident. None of the 173 occupants was injured. Weather conditions and visibility at the time were good. Italian-based Neos has started using the incident in its training to highlight the risks of rushed and unstable approaches, says the inquiry, and is also using flight-data monitoring to identify similar approaches more readily.",4,280,7.0,0.6908,"crew, runway, inquiry, land, approach, accident, investigator, captain, incident, pilot","['investigator', 'found', 'neos', 'continued', 'descend', 'unnoticed', 'crew', 'aborted', 'land', 'bristol', 'rush', 'approach', 'meant', 'goaround', 'altitude', 'correctly', 'set', 'dipped', 'travel', 'runway', 'landinggear', 'retract', 'pilot', 'realise', 'situation', 'climbed', 'away', 'arrive', 'verona', 'june', 'vectored', 'shorten', 'arrival', 'route', 'approach', 'controller', 'left', 'less', 'touchdown', 'high', 'fast', 'approach', 'crew', 'unable', 'switch', 'autopilot', 'vertical', 'navigation', 'mode', 'pilot', 'instead', 'revert', 'change', 'mode', 'carry', 'idlethrust', 'descent', 'altitude', 'select', 'modecontrol', 'panel', 'set', 'approach', 'minimum', 'result', 'shorten', 'approach', 'descent', 'rush', 'become', 'unstable', 'sank', 'designate', 'flightpath', 'travel', 'excessive', 'airspeed', 'tower', 'controller', 'instruct', 'crew', 'execute', 'goaround', 'uk', 'accident', 'investigation', 'branch', 'say', 'ground', 'fly', 'crew', 'found', 'perform', 'goaround', 'unexpectedly', 'know', 'require', 'add', 'takeoff', 'thrust', 'engage', 'begin', 'climb', 'altitude', 'set', 'modecontrol', 'panel', 'remain', 'crew', 'omit', 'select', 'goaround', 'altitude', 'although', 'initially', 'climbed', 'fly', 'pilot', 'manually', 'follow', 'director', 'attempt', 'guide', 'level', 'jet', 'acquire', 'altitude', 'autothrottle', 'mode', 'change', 'mode', 'maintains', 'speed', 'result', 'thrust', 'lever', 'backdriven', 'low', 'power', 'set', 'cause', 'landinggear', 'warn', 'horn', 'sound', 'crew', 'adjust', 'modecontrol', 'panel', 'set', 'correct', 'goaround', 'altitude', 'stop', 'try', 'level', 'cause', 'switch', 'verticalspeed', 'mode', 'vertical', 'speed', 'set', 'modecontrol', 'panel', 'descent', 'rate', 'jet', 'start', 'lose', 'height', 'pilot', 'continued', 'follow', 'director', 'neither', 'crew', 'member', 'notice', 'significant', 'period', 'descend', 'manoeuvre', 'say', 'inquiry', 'point', 'gearwarning', 'horn', 'still', 'active', 'owe', 'low', 'thrust', 'flap', 'setting', 'follow', 'low', 'gear', 'warn', 'groundproximity', 'warn', 'system', 'jet', 'descend', 'say', 'inquiry', 'reach', 'minimum', 'ground', 'passing', 'almost', 'entire', 'length', 'runway', 'crew', 'realise', 'climb', 'expect', 'adjust', 'attitude', 'begin', 'climb', 'state', 'add', 'tower', 'controller', 'almost', 'simultaneously', 'issue', 'order', 'climb', 'climb', 'away', 'ineot', 'subsequently', 'level', 'vectored', 'another', 'approach', 'follow', 'land', 'without', 'far', 'incident', 'none', 'occupant', 'injured', 'weather', 'condition', 'visibility', 'good', 'italianbased', 'neos', 'start', 'use', 'incident', 'training', 'highlight', 'risk', 'rush', 'unstable', 'approach', 'say', 'inquiry', 'use', 'flightdata', 'monitoring', 'identify', 'similar', 'approach', 'readily']"
"ICAO forecasts that the Covid-19 crisis could send the number of international air travellers falling by up to 1.2 billion by September 2020, compared to a typical year. It also estimates that airline revenues could fall by $160-253 billion for the first nine months of this year, with international capacity down by up to two-thirds. According to its baseline scenario, referencing originally planned capacity, passenger numbers could have risen by 64 million in the first nine months of this year, while revenues could have increased by $15 billion. In a new report published on 21 April, ICAO says that Europe and Asia-Pacific will see the greatest hit to capacity and revenue. Over two-thirds of the predicted revenue loss will be accounted for in Asia-Pacific and Europe, it estimates. The report also details a 19% year-on-year drop in air freight for the month of March, measured in tonnes transported, for a 22% drop in air freight revenues as the grounding of passenger aircraft worldwide led to the loss of belly capacity. Belly cargo is down 31% while all freighter capacity is up 9%. It also estimates that so far in April global passenger capacity is down 91%. ICAO's estimates vary across two scenarios - one a V-shaped recovery with first signs of recovery in late May and the other a U-shaped path with a restart of air travel in the third quarter or later. The 2003 SARS outbreak had a V-shaped impact on aviation, ICAO says. It notes, however, that the impact of Covid-19 has already surpassed that outbreak, which was largely confined to the Asia-Pacific region. “The 6€month recovery path of SARS might not apply to today's situation,” the report cautions.",4,281,3.0,0.2738,"passenger, loss, operating, revenue, traffic, month, increase, capacity, decline, result","['icao', 'forecast', 'coronavirus', 'crisis', 'send', 'number', 'international', 'traveller', 'fall', 'september', 'compare', 'typical', 'estimate', 'revenue', 'fall', 'month', 'international', 'capacity', 'twothirds', 'accord', 'baseline', 'scenario', 'reference', 'originally', 'plan', 'capacity', 'passenger', 'number', 'risen', 'month', 'revenue', 'increase', 'report', 'publish', 'april', 'icao', 'say', 'europe', 'asiapacific', 'see', 'great', 'hit', 'capacity', 'revenue', 'twothirds', 'predict', 'revenue', 'loss', 'account', 'asiapacific', 'europe', 'estimate', 'report', 'detail', 'yearonyear', 'drop', 'freight', 'month', 'march', 'measure', 'tonne', 'transport', 'drop', 'freight', 'revenue', 'ground', 'passenger', 'worldwide', 'lead', 'loss', 'belly', 'capacity', 'belly', 'cargo', 'freighter', 'capacity', 'estimate', 'far', 'april', 'global', 'passenger', 'capacity', 'icao', 'estimate', 'vary', 'across', 'scenario', 'vshaped', 'recovery', 'sign', 'recovery', 'late', 'may', 'ushaped', 'path', 'restart', 'travel', 'third', 'quarter', 'later', 'sars', 'outbreak', 'vshaped', 'impact', 'icao', 'say', 'note', 'however', 'impact', 'coronavirus', 'already', 'surpass', 'outbreak', 'largely', 'confine', 'asiapacific', 'region', 'recovery', 'path', 'sars', 'might', 'apply', 'today', 'situation', 'report', 'caution']"
"South Africa's government is pressing unions to avert a collapse of South African Airways and ensure that the business rescue strategy results in the emergence of a more competitive carrier. It has asked unions to submit proposals on restructuring the carrier and, in particular, details on the future of jobs. The unions have conceded that some jobs must be lost, says the department for public enterprises, if SAA is to become a stronger operation. With the future of the airline – which had already been undergoing a business rescue process before the coronavirus crisis – looking particularly bleak, the department held a 21 April meeting with unions and other government representatives to outline the situation. The government stressed during the meeting that it was “not in a position” to provide more capital to SAA, and that all parties needed to “commit to a creative solution” in order to “avoid a scenario where the business rescue is deemed to have failed”. “There was consensus that unions would work with the government to ensure that a new financially-viable and competitive airline emerges from the business rescue process,” the department of public enterprises says. Consultation forums will be set up to discuss the details of managing the personnel situation. “Employees that remain behind will need to sacrifice some of the unaffordable arrangements that had worsened the airline's financial position,” the department states, adding that unions understood this point. Social plans, it adds, will be developed to “cushion the effects of losing jobs” for those SAA staff members affected. SAA's business rescue practitioners will be briefed and encouraged to take account of the “constructive development” with the unions, it says.",4,282,8.0,0.443,"government, uk, carrier, business, state, share, south, airway, financial, plan","['south', 'africa', 'government', 'press', 'union', 'avert', 'collapse', 'south', 'african', 'airway', 'ensure', 'business', 'rescue', 'strategy', 'result', 'emergence', 'competitive', 'carrier', 'ask', 'union', 'submit', 'proposal', 'restructuring', 'carrier', 'particular', 'detail', 'future', 'job', 'union', 'concede', 'job', 'must', 'lose', 'say', 'department', 'public', 'enterprise', 'saa', 'become', 'strong', 'operation', 'future', 'already', 'undergo', 'business', 'rescue', 'process', 'coronavirus', 'crisis', 'look', 'particularly', 'bleak', 'department', 'held', 'april', 'meeting', 'union', 'government', 'representative', 'outline', 'situation', 'government', 'stress', 'meeting', 'position', 'provide', 'capital', 'saa', 'party', 'need', 'commit', 'creative', 'solution', 'order', 'avoid', 'scenario', 'business', 'rescue', 'deem', 'fail', 'consensus', 'union', 'work', 'government', 'ensure', 'financiallyviable', 'competitive', 'emerges', 'business', 'rescue', 'process', 'department', 'public', 'enterprise', 'say', 'consultation', 'forum', 'set', 'discus', 'detail', 'manage', 'personnel', 'situation', 'employee', 'remain', 'behind', 'need', 'sacrifice', 'unaffordable', 'arrangement', 'worsen', 'financial', 'position', 'department', 'state', 'add', 'union', 'understood', 'point', 'social', 'plan', 'add', 'developed', 'cushion', 'effect', 'lose', 'job', 'saa', 'staff', 'member', 'affected', 'saa', 'business', 'rescue', 'practitioner', 'briefed', 'encourage', 'take', 'account', 'constructive', 'development', 'union', 'say']"
"Airbus has developed a removable cover for A350 integrated control panels, designed to protect vital systems from inadvertent liquid spills in the cockpit, after two incidents which preceded uncommanded engine shutdown. The cover – which protects engine master levers, thumbwheels and rotary knobs – needs to be removed during critical flight phases, including take-off, approach and landing. But outside of these, such as during the cruise, the cover must be fitted, according to a directive from the European Union Aviation Safety Agency. Spillage of beverages on the centre pedestal control panel, in the cockpits of a Delta Air Lines A350 in January and an Asiana A350 last November, each preceded engine shutdown and diversion. Airbus introduced a temporary revision to the aircraft flight manual which defined a 'liquid prohibited' zone in the cockpit. But the airframer has since developed the removable cover which EASA is instructing A350 operators to fit within 28 days. The directive also includes instructions for use of the cover as well as master minimum equipment list considerations for operating the aircraft if the cover is damaged or missing. EASA states that the directive remains an interim measure and could still be followed by further regulatory action on the issue.",4,283,6.0,0.3062,"engine, maintenance, fuel, takeoff, result, failure, system, problem, power, issue","['developed', 'removable', 'cover', 'integrate', 'control', 'panel', 'design', 'protect', 'vital', 'system', 'inadvertent', 'liquid', 'spill', 'cockpit', 'incident', 'precede', 'uncommanded', 'engine', 'shutdown', 'cover', 'protects', 'engine', 'master', 'lever', 'thumbwheels', 'rotary', 'knob', 'need', 'remove', 'critical', 'phase', 'include', 'takeoff', 'approach', 'land', 'outside', 'cruise', 'cover', 'must', 'fit', 'accord', 'directive', 'european', 'union', 'safety', 'agency', 'spillage', 'beverage', 'centre', 'pedestal', 'control', 'panel', 'cockpit', 'delta', 'line', 'january', 'asiana', 'november', 'precede', 'engine', 'shutdown', 'diversion', 'introduce', 'temporary', 'revision', 'manual', 'define', 'prohibit', 'zone', 'cockpit', 'airframer', 'since', 'developed', 'removable', 'cover', 'easa', 'instruct', 'operator', 'fit', 'within', 'day', 'directive', 'include', 'instruction', 'use', 'cover', 'well', 'master', 'minimum', 'equipment', 'list', 'consideration', 'operating', 'cover', 'damage', 'miss', 'easa', 'state', 'directive', 'remains', 'interim', 'measure', 'still', 'follow', 'far', 'regulatory', 'action', 'issue']"
"UK investigators probing a serious dual engine problem on a departing Airbus A321 have discovered its fuel system had previously been overdosed with biocide, after a maintenance engineer misunderstood a measurement term. The engineer was confused by the term 'ppm' – meaning 'parts per million' – while conducting a biocidal shock treatment of the Titan Airways A321's fuel tanks, as the jet neared the end of a month-long maintenance check. While the anti-contamination treatment required a biocide concentration of 100ppm, no explanation or instruction for calculating the overall quantity featured in the aircraft maintenance manual task, and the engineer resorted to an internet calculator. But he miscalculated the dose and, instead of the correct quantity of just under 0.8kg, he poured 30kg of biocide into each of the right- and left-hand wing tanks – equivalent to more than 37 times the maximum permitted dosage, given that the tanks both held 6,200kg of fuel. “The task had not been designated as a critical task, and therefore no additional measures were used to check that it was performed in accordance with the [manual],” says the UK Air Accidents Investigation Branch. “No control measures were in place at the [maintenance organisation's] stores or planning departments to prevent unusually large quantities of chemicals being issued to [engineering] staff.” It adds that the pouring of the biocide directly into the tanks was not an approved process, and it should have been pre-mixed with fuel. While the inquiry suspects the excessive level of Kathon FP 1.5 biocide is connected to the subsequent engine problems, it is still working to understand the impact of the errors. The A321 experienced a number of engine start-up and performance difficulties while conducting flights on 26 February, two days after the aircraft returned to operations post-maintenance. But the most serious of these occurred as it took off from London Gatwick on a crew-only ferry to London Stansted. The aircraft's left-hand CFM International CFM56 powerplant began “banging and surging” at 500ft, says the inquiry, the engine's N1 dropped to less than 40% for 25s, and the jet started to fishtail. As the crew declared an emergency and requested a return to Gatwick, instruments indicated an intermittent stall of the right-hand engine. The crew reduce the thrust and flew high on the approach, preparing for a possible glide if the engine situation deteriorated. The A321 touched down safely about 11min after departure, with no injuries to the seven occupants. Use of the Kathon FP 1.5 biocide for aviation fuel was suspended by the product's manufacturer on 10 March. The inquiry is also looking into another maintenance error that occurred before the Gatwick departure incident, after the A321 arrived from Krakow. Owing to the engine difficulties recorded during the inbound flight, an engineer for a line maintenance provider at Gatwick was instructed to examine the right-hand engine. But the engineer did not filter the troubleshooting manual for the specific aircraft (G-POWN) and, instead of using a procedure for a CFM56 powerplant, applied one for the CFM Leap-1A which is fitted to the A320neo family. “The reasons why the Gatwick engineer selected the troubleshooting procedure for the Leap engine, and any impact of this on the sequence of events in the subsequent serious incident, will be investigated further,” says the inquiry. In the interim, it says, both the Gatwick maintenance organisation and the maintenance firm which carried out the biocide treatment have taken steps intended to reduce the risk of error recurrence. UK investigators are being assisted in the probe by US, French and Cypriot authorities.",4,284,6.0,0.4961,"engine, maintenance, fuel, takeoff, result, failure, system, problem, power, issue","['uk', 'investigator', 'probe', 'serious', 'dual', 'engine', 'problem', 'depart', 'discover', 'fuel', 'system', 'previously', 'overdose', 'biocide', 'maintenance', 'engineer', 'misunderstood', 'measurement', 'term', 'engineer', 'confuse', 'term', 'meaning', 'per', 'conduct', 'biocidal', 'shock', 'treatment', 'titan', 'airway', 'fuel', 'tank', 'jet', 'near', 'end', 'monthlong', 'maintenance', 'check', 'anticontamination', 'treatment', 'require', 'biocide', 'concentration', 'explanation', 'instruction', 'calculate', 'overall', 'quantity', 'feature', 'maintenance', 'manual', 'task', 'engineer', 'resort', 'internet', 'calculator', 'miscalculate', 'dose', 'instead', 'correct', 'quantity', 'pour', 'biocide', 'right', 'lefthand', 'wing', 'tank', 'equivalent', 'maximum', 'permit', 'dosage', 'give', 'tank', 'held', 'fuel', 'task', 'designate', 'critical', 'task', 'therefore', 'additional', 'measure', 'use', 'check', 'perform', 'accordance', 'manual', 'say', 'uk', 'accident', 'investigation', 'branch', 'control', 'measure', 'place', 'maintenance', 'organisation', 'store', 'planning', 'department', 'prevent', 'unusually', 'large', 'quantity', 'chemical', 'issue', 'engineering', 'add', 'pour', 'biocide', 'directly', 'tank', 'approve', 'process', 'premixed', 'fuel', 'inquiry', 'suspect', 'excessive', 'level', 'kathon', 'fp', 'biocide', 'connect', 'subsequent', 'engine', 'problem', 'still', 'work', 'understand', 'impact', 'error', 'experienced', 'number', 'engine', 'startup', 'performance', 'difficulty', 'conduct', 'february', 'day', 'return', 'operation', 'postmaintenance', 'serious', 'occur', 'take', 'london', 'gatwick', 'crewonly', 'ferry', 'london', 'stansted', 'lefthand', 'cfm', 'international', 'powerplant', 'begin', 'banging', 'surge', 'say', 'inquiry', 'engine', 'drop', 'less', 'jet', 'start', 'fishtail', 'crew', 'declare', 'emergency', 'request', 'return', 'gatwick', 'instrument', 'indicate', 'intermittent', 'stall', 'righthand', 'engine', 'crew', 'reduce', 'thrust', 'flew', 'high', 'approach', 'prepare', 'possible', 'glide', 'engine', 'situation', 'deteriorate', 'touch', 'safely', 'departure', 'injury', 'occupant', 'use', 'kathon', 'fp', 'biocide', 'fuel', 'suspend', 'product', 'manufacturer', 'march', 'inquiry', 'look', 'another', 'maintenance', 'error', 'occur', 'gatwick', 'departure', 'incident', 'arrive', 'krakow', 'owe', 'engine', 'difficulty', 'record', 'inbound', 'engineer', 'line', 'maintenance', 'provider', 'gatwick', 'instruct', 'examine', 'righthand', 'engine', 'engineer', 'filter', 'troubleshoot', 'manual', 'specific', 'gpown', 'instead', 'use', 'procedure', 'powerplant', 'apply', 'cfm', 'fit', 'family', 'reason', 'gatwick', 'engineer', 'select', 'troubleshoot', 'procedure', 'leap', 'engine', 'impact', 'sequence', 'event', 'subsequent', 'serious', 'incident', 'investigate', 'far', 'say', 'inquiry', 'interim', 'say', 'gatwick', 'maintenance', 'organisation', 'maintenance', 'firm', 'carry', 'biocide', 'treatment', 'take', 'step', 'intend', 'reduce', 'risk', 'error', 'recurrence', 'uk', 'investigator', 'assist', 'probe', 'u', 'french', 'cypriot', 'authority']"
"Lufthansa Group carrier Austrian Airlines is to halve its Boeing 767 fleet and withdraw all seven of its Airbus A319s as part of a strategy to adjust to reduced demand in the wake of the coronavirus crisis. Austrian had already been planning to remove 18 Bombardier Q400 turboprops by 2021, and increase the number of A320s by 10 – measures which would have taken the airline's overall fleet down to around 70 aircraft. But it has revised its strategy following the coronavirus outbreak and instead envisions a more conservative fleet of 60, amounting to an overall capacity reduction of 20%. By 2022 it will remove three of its oldest 767-300ERs – the 1991-92 airframes OE-LAT, OE-LAW and OE-LAX, all powered by Pratt & Whitney PW4000 engines – as well as its entire batch of A319s. The seven A319s, fitted with CFM International CFM56 powerplants, date from 2004-05 according to Cirium fleets information. Austrian will retain three 767-300ERs, which are all 1998-2000 airframes, as part of a long-haul fleet of nine. The airline has six Boeing 777-200ERs. “It is our responsibility to make Austrian Airlines fit for the future after [the coronavirus crisis],” says chief executive Alexis von Hoensbroech. “We want to retain our long-haul hub, even if we have no other choice for the time being but to adapt to the somewhat smaller market.” The carrier stresses that it is aiming to retain as many of its 7,000 personnel as possible, and is holding talks with staff representatives. Austrian is forecasting a 25-50% fall in demand in 2020 and that this figure will still be down by 25% on pre-crisis levels at the end of 2021 – with the earliest full return in 2023.",4,285,4.0,0.2363,"airport, fleet, service, data, carrier, operation, passenger, number, operate, operator","['lufthansa', 'carrier', 'austrian', 'halve', 'fleet', 'withdraw', 'part', 'strategy', 'adjust', 'reduce', 'demand', 'wake', 'coronavirus', 'crisis', 'austrian', 'already', 'planning', 'remove', 'bombardier', 'turboprop', 'increase', 'number', 'measure', 'take', 'overall', 'fleet', 'around', 'revise', 'strategy', 'follow', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'instead', 'envisions', 'conservative', 'fleet', 'amount', 'overall', 'capacity', 'reduction', 'remove', 'old', 'airframe', 'oelat', 'oelaw', 'oelax', 'power', 'pratt', 'whitney', 'engine', 'well', 'entire', 'batch', 'fit', 'cfm', 'international', 'powerplants', 'date', 'accord', 'fleet', 'information', 'austrian', 'retain', 'airframe', 'part', 'longhaul', 'fleet', 'responsibility', 'make', 'austrian', 'fit', 'future', 'coronavirus', 'crisis', 'say', 'chief', 'executive', 'alexis', 'von', 'hoensbroech', 'want', 'retain', 'longhaul', 'hub', 'even', 'choice', 'adapt', 'somewhat', 'small', 'carrier', 'stress', 'aim', 'retain', 'many', 'personnel', 'possible', 'hold', 'talk', 'staff', 'representative', 'austrian', 'forecasting', 'fall', 'demand', 'figure', 'still', 'precrisis', 'level', 'end', 'early', 'full', 'return']"
"South Korea's Asiana Airlines has received additional loans from two state banks as it grapples with the coronavirus crisis, according to media reports. The Korea Development Bank (KDB) and the Export-Import Bank of Korea will inject W1.7 trillion ($1.4 billion) into South Korea's second-largest carrier, Yonhap and Reuters reported on Tuesday. The banks had already extended W1.6 trillion of loans to loss-making Asiana last year. Yonhap cited a KDB official as saying that the new funds were awarded to dispel growing concerns that the creditor banks' plan to sell Asiana may fall through due to the impact of Covid-19. A deal was signed in December for a Hyundai Development-led consortium to buy a 31% stake and invest in new shares to take over Asiana. However, the acquisition still requires regulatory approval in some countries and the spread of Covid-19 has raised doubts over the deal, according to South Korean media reports.

"Asia-Pacific airports have seen traffic hit “rock bottom” due to the coronavirus outbreak, said the Airports Council International (ACI) Asia-Pacific. According to preliminary traffic data the trade association released on 20 April, 18 airports in major aviation markets in Asia-Pacific and the Middle East saw traffic plummet by 95% by the middle of April. “Passenger traffic in Asia-Pacific region has reached rock bottom. Airports have been forced to make difficult operational decisions including full or partial closure of terminals and runways and reduction of front-line employees,” ACI Asia-Pacific director general Stefano Baronci said in a statement. He cautions that those measures will take time to reverse and a return to full operational status will not happen overnight. ACI Asia-Pacific is calling for a coordinated approach between governments, regulators, health authorities and aviation stakeholders to manage the post-Covid-19 recovery. Screening of passengers upon departure and arrival, health declarations for travellers, changes to airport security checks and measures to keep passengers apart in airport shops and cafes are among the measures the industry may need to take to restore passenger confidence in travelling. Baronci said freedom of movement will have to co-exist with the virus until a vaccine is available globally. He states: “The virus has imposed a 'new normal' of living on us. A united industry needs to create a 'new normal' for travelling.”",4,287,9.0,0.2149,"industry, crisis, demand, coronavirus, global, iata, market, level, cargo, expect","['asiapacific', 'airport', 'see', 'traffic', 'hit', 'rock', 'bottom', 'due', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'say', 'airport', 'council', 'international', 'aci', 'asiapacific', 'accord', 'preliminary', 'traffic', 'data', 'trade', 'association', 'release', 'april', 'airport', 'major', 'market', 'asiapacific', 'middle', 'east', 'saw', 'traffic', 'plummet', 'middle', 'april', 'passenger', 'traffic', 'asiapacific', 'region', 'reach', 'rock', 'bottom', 'airport', 'force', 'make', 'difficult', 'operational', 'decision', 'include', 'full', 'partial', 'closure', 'terminal', 'runway', 'reduction', 'frontline', 'employee', 'aci', 'asiapacific', 'director', 'general', 'stefano', 'baronci', 'say', 'statement', 'caution', 'measure', 'take', 'reverse', 'return', 'full', 'operational', 'status', 'happen', 'overnight', 'aci', 'asiapacific', 'call', 'coordinate', 'approach', 'government', 'regulator', 'health', 'authority', 'stakeholder', 'manage', 'postcoronavirus', 'recovery', 'screen', 'passenger', 'upon', 'departure', 'arrival', 'health', 'declaration', 'traveller', 'change', 'airport', 'security', 'check', 'measure', 'keep', 'passenger', 'apart', 'airport', 'shop', 'cafe', 'among', 'measure', 'industry', 'may', 'need', 'take', 'restore', 'passenger', 'confidence', 'travel', 'baronci', 'say', 'freedom', 'movement', 'coexist', 'virus', 'vaccine', 'available', 'globally', 'state', 'virus', 'impose', 'normal', 'living', 'u', 'united', 'industry', 'need', 'create', 'normal', 'travel']"
"The US Air Force's (USAF) ambitious battlefield network development effort, called the Advanced Battle Management System (ABMS), lacks the organisational structure needed to be executed well. In particular, the service is moving forward with developing a key part of its future modernisation strategy without firm technical requirements, a plan, a cost estimate, authority clearly delegated to decision makers, or an analysis of affordability, says the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in a report released on 16 April. The USAF is developing the ABMS as an overarching communications network intended to link aircraft, satellites, ships, ground vehicles and command and control stations. The service envisions the network allowing commanders to share battlefield information directly and in real time, instead of relying on fractured communications systems which are particular to certain types of aircraft and armed forces. The AMBS is to replace the service's Northrop Grumman E-8 Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System, an airborne surveillance, as well as battlefield command and control station. But the USAF also hopes the ABMS could eventually become the sole network of all the US military services, the so-called Joint All Domain Command and Control system. Eventually, the hope is, a joint battlefield network would allow the US military to coordinate military operations more closely, allowing for a pace of war that adversaries would struggle to match. The US Navy and US Army have yet to commit to the USAF's ABMS. Part of the USAF's lack of planning appears to come from the service's strategy of iteration, a concept where new technologies would be developed into prototypes over the course short sprints lasting four to six months and then demonstrated in field experiments. Lessons learned from the sprint would be incorporated into design changes for the next sprint until a production-quality product is refined. The GAO is worried that the process is too open ended and not thought all the way through, however. “GAO's previous work has shown that weapon systems without a sound business case are at greater risk for schedule delays, cost growth, and integration issues,” says the government agency. The government body notes that is especially worrying because of the size of the ABMS experiment. The effort received $172 million in funding through FY2020. The GAO recommends the USAF come up with firm technical requirements, a cost estimate, an affordability assessment and delegate decision-making responsibilities. It also suggests the service update the US Congress quarterly on its progress. The USAF reviewed and agreed to the recommendations, says the GAO.",4,288,1.0,0.4935,"test, force, helicopter, fire, system, service, attack, design, usaf, missile","['u', 'force', 'usaf', 'ambitious', 'battlefield', 'network', 'development', 'effort', 'call', 'advanced', 'battle', 'management', 'system', 'abm', 'lack', 'organisational', 'structure', 'need', 'execute', 'well', 'particular', 'service', 'move', 'forward', 'develop', 'key', 'part', 'future', 'modernisation', 'strategy', 'without', 'firm', 'technical', 'requirement', 'plan', 'cost', 'estimate', 'authority', 'clearly', 'delegate', 'decision', 'maker', 'analysis', 'affordability', 'say', 'government', 'accountability', 'office', 'gao', 'report', 'release', 'april', 'usaf', 'develop', 'abm', 'overarch', 'communication', 'network', 'intend', 'link', 'satellite', 'ship', 'ground', 'vehicle', 'command', 'control', 'station', 'service', 'envisions', 'network', 'allow', 'commander', 'share', 'battlefield', 'information', 'directly', 'real', 'instead', 'rely', 'fracture', 'communication', 'system', 'particular', 'certain', 'type', 'arm', 'force', 'ambs', 'replace', 'service', 'northrop', 'grumman', 'joint', 'surveillance', 'target', 'attack', 'radar', 'system', 'airborne', 'surveillance', 'well', 'battlefield', 'command', 'control', 'station', 'usaf', 'hope', 'abm', 'eventually', 'become', 'sole', 'network', 'u', 'military', 'service', 'socalled', 'joint', 'domain', 'command', 'control', 'system', 'eventually', 'hope', 'joint', 'battlefield', 'network', 'allow', 'u', 'military', 'coordinate', 'military', 'operation', 'closely', 'allow', 'pace', 'war', 'adversary', 'struggle', 'match', 'u', 'navy', 'u', 'army', 'yet', 'commit', 'usaf', 'abm', 'part', 'usaf', 'lack', 'planning', 'appear', 'come', 'service', 'strategy', 'iteration', 'concept', 'technology', 'developed', 'prototype', 'course', 'short', 'sprint', 'month', 'demonstrate', 'field', 'experiment', 'lesson', 'learn', 'sprint', 'incorporate', 'design', 'change', 'next', 'sprint', 'productionquality', 'product', 'refine', 'gao', 'worried', 'process', 'open', 'end', 'thought', 'way', 'however', 'gao', 'previous', 'work', 'weapon', 'system', 'without', 'sound', 'business', 'case', 'great', 'risk', 'schedule', 'delay', 'cost', 'growth', 'integration', 'issue', 'say', 'government', 'agency', 'government', 'body', 'note', 'especially', 'worry', 'size', 'abm', 'experiment', 'effort', 'receive', 'funding', 'gao', 'recommends', 'usaf', 'come', 'firm', 'technical', 'requirement', 'cost', 'estimate', 'affordability', 'assessment', 'delegate', 'decisionmaking', 'responsibility', 'suggests', 'service', 'update', 'u', 'congress', 'quarterly', 'progress', 'usaf', 'review', 'agree', 'recommendation', 'say', 'gao']"
"Lockheed Martin is projecting fewer F-35 Lightning II stealth fighter deliveries in 2020 due to impacts on its global supply chain caused by disruptions related to the coronavirus pandemic. The manufacturer is not yet sure exactly how much its deliveries will decrease, but is assessing likely outcomes, it said in an earnings call on 21 April. The company delivered 134 F-35s in 2019, and is scheduled to transfer 141 examples this year. Its first-quarter results show that 22 were handed over by 31 March: a reduction from 26 in the first three months of last year. Lockheed Martin lowered the upper end of its aeronautics unit's annual revenue projection by about 2% to $24.6 billion. The company's annual profit projection fell about 1% to $2.67 billion. The F-35 is the largest revenue-generating business line within the aeronautics unit. “What we're seeing is there are local distancing requirements that are being more-stringently applied across the globe. There's workforce disruption,” says Kenneth Possenriede, executive vice-president and chief financial officer with Lockheed Martin. “There are likely impacts that are happening throughout their supply tier hierarchy. There are shipping constraints...We're also finding there's likely going to be some production impacts at our site.” The majority of F-35s go through final assembly in Fort Worth, Texas. A smaller number of aircraft are built at final assembly and checkout facilities in Cameri, Italy and Nagoya, Japan. Both those sites were disrupted by coronavirus quarantined restrictions, but are running again, says Possenriede. Suppliers are also impacted. “Think of them as travel restrictions and site access that are most likely the common cited driver of impact,” says Possenriede. “We're seeing increases in supplier shortages. And in our sites, we're seeing some absenteeism impacts.” Modernisation and sustainment work on the F-35 programme does not look likely to be impacted, he says. Lockheed Martin is hoping for a return to normal in the coming months. “We're hoping that the curve starts flattening in the second quarter, end of second quarter, and we can get to some kind of semblance of business as usual, whatever that is, starting in the third quarter,” says Possenriede.",4,289,0.0,0.2254,"order, business, jet, delivery, production, customer, deliver, commercial, quarter, include","['lockheed', 'martin', 'project', 'lightning', 'ii', 'stealth', 'fighter', 'delivery', 'due', 'impact', 'global', 'supply', 'chain', 'cause', 'disruption', 'related', 'coronavirus', 'pandemic', 'manufacturer', 'yet', 'sure', 'exactly', 'much', 'delivery', 'decrease', 'assess', 'likely', 'outcome', 'say', 'earnings', 'call', 'april', 'deliver', 'schedule', 'transfer', 'example', 'firstquarter', 'result', 'hand', 'march', 'reduction', 'month', 'lockheed', 'martin', 'lower', 'upper', 'end', 'aeronautics', 'unit', 'annual', 'revenue', 'projection', 'annual', 'profit', 'projection', 'fell', 'large', 'revenuegenerating', 'business', 'line', 'within', 'aeronautics', 'unit', 'see', 'local', 'distance', 'requirement', 'morestringently', 'apply', 'across', 'globe', 'workforce', 'disruption', 'say', 'kenneth', 'possenriede', 'executive', 'vicepresident', 'chief', 'financial', 'officer', 'lockheed', 'martin', 'likely', 'impact', 'happen', 'throughout', 'supply', 'tier', 'hierarchy', 'shipping', 'constraint', 'find', 'likely', 'go', 'production', 'impact', 'majority', 'go', 'final', 'assembly', 'fort', 'worth', 'texas', 'small', 'number', 'built', 'final', 'assembly', 'checkout', 'facility', 'cameri', 'italy', 'nagoya', 'japan', 'site', 'disrupt', 'coronavirus', 'quarantine', 'restriction', 'run', 'say', 'possenriede', 'supplier', 'impact', 'think', 'travel', 'restriction', 'site', 'access', 'likely', 'common', 'cite', 'driver', 'impact', 'say', 'possenriede', 'see', 'increase', 'supplier', 'shortage', 'site', 'see', 'absenteeism', 'modernisation', 'sustainment', 'work', 'programme', 'look', 'likely', 'impact', 'say', 'lockheed', 'martin', 'hop', 'return', 'normal', 'come', 'month', 'hop', 'curve', 'start', 'flatten', 'second', 'quarter', 'end', 'second', 'quarter', 'get', 'kind', 'semblance', 'business', 'usual', 'whatever', 'start', 'third', 'quarter', 'say', 'possenriede']"
"Germany is to pursue a split order for the replacement of its Panavia Tornado combat aircraft, selecting both European and US models for the requirement. Defence minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer has written to the German parliament informing them of the government's intention, according to the DPA news agency. Berlin intends to purchase 30 F/A-18E/F Super Hornets to carry nuclear payloads, plus 15 EA-18G Growler electronic warfare aircraft. In addition, Kramp-Karrenbauer says it will acquire 93 Eurofighters. While 55 of these will be Tornado replacements, an additional 38 aircraft are likely to be covered by its Quadriga project to replace the Tranche 1 Eurofighters in the Luftwaffe's fleet. The decision is likely to attract political criticism, both from the SPD party – part of the coalition government – and from Germany's trade unions which are opposed to a split buy on industrial grounds.

"Deliveries of business aircraft could plunge by up to 50% this year, an analyst has warned, as the coronavirus crisis takes its toll on the industry. In 2019, there were 726 business jet shipments, according to data from the General Aviation Manufacturers Association, but that figure is likely to be significantly lower this year, predicts Rolland Vincent in the JetNet IQ Pulse report issued on 21 April. Embraer Legacy 450 JetNet IQ had previously predicted a similar level of deliveries in 2020, but now says the best-case scenario is 640, potentially falling to as low as 375. “Much depends upon whether we see on-going furloughs at the OEMs and their suppliers,” says Vincent, citing Bombardier, Embraer and Textron Aviation as examples. “At this point in time, we are already seeing the beginnings of a second wave of furloughs that will take us into the early summer months at some companies,” he says. Even if manufacturers can somehow get back to building aircraft, Vincent says the challenge will be persuading customers to take a demo flight, attend specification sessions for their chosen model, and to “do a deal and part with their hard-earned capital at this time”. As a consequence, white tails - completed aircraft with no buyers - seem likely to have accumulated by year-end, Vincent warns. “This is a real risk to the delivery numbers for 2020, especially as OEMs seek to maintain pricing discipline and hold the line on discounting,” he says. ”I would expect that it is going to be three years or so before we get back to the new business jet delivery trend line that we had been projecting as recently as a few months ago,” Vincent adds. He describes the coronavirus crisis as the “black swan of swans” which is ”far more pervasive and serious than anything the business aviation industry and its participants have ever seen. “Although our industry is not alone in its suffering or its search for pain relief, getting back to some semblance of normal could take longer than any of us would like to imagine or endure,” says Vincent. Increasing caution is also affecting the pre-owned market. The report records a total of 2,237 units for sale on 15 April – equivalent to 10% of the global fleet - a 135-unit or 6% increase on the same period last year. “These are not fire-sale numbers by any stretch of the imagination, although aircraft pricing and valuation precision is next to impossible to ascertain in the current environment, with an absence of new and pre-owned transactions,” says Vincent. On the plus side, money is very cheap, the OEMs have new products sell, and residual values are not inflated as they were during the previous economic crisis in 2008, he says. The operations side is also gloomy, with flights and hours flown in the USA alone down by 75% year on year in the 30 days ended 15 April, says the report. The next six months are going be particularly quiet for the business aviation industry, but Vincent is hopeful there will be “some semblance of an initial recovery” in the fourth quarter, as the “worst of the Covid-19 impacts” subside and the “highly contentious” US presidential election is over. “We will begin to see the benefits of massive waves of government intervention, stabilisation, and stimulus investments beginning as soon as Q3 2020, but this is going to be a very tough year,” says Vincent. He cites economic forecasts that are “suddenly calling for a broad and global recession in 2020 - including forecasts of GDP growth of -6% for the USA - with a spring back beginning later in the year and continuing through 2023”. He expects flight operations - such as charter, fractional ownership and corporate flying - and pre-owned transactions to bounce back fairly quickly as “supply and demand forces re-stabilise” and business and consumer confidence rebuilds. “With reduced airline schedules going forward, it is likely that more companies are going to look at better and more secure ways of moving their people from place to place, and business aviation - charter providers in particular - should be beneficiaries,” says Vincent.",4,292,0.0,0.289,"order, business, jet, delivery, production, customer, deliver, commercial, quarter, include","['delivery', 'business', 'plunge', 'analyst', 'warn', 'coronavirus', 'crisis', 'take', 'toll', 'industry', 'business', 'jet', 'shipment', 'accord', 'data', 'general', 'manufacturer', 'association', 'figure', 'likely', 'significantly', 'low', 'predicts', 'rolland', 'vincent', 'jetnet', 'iq', 'pulse', 'report', 'issue', 'april', 'embraer', 'legacy', 'jetnet', 'iq', 'previously', 'predict', 'similar', 'level', 'delivery', 'say', 'bestcase', 'scenario', 'potentially', 'fall', 'low', 'much', 'depends', 'upon', 'whether', 'see', 'ongoing', 'furlough', 'oems', 'supplier', 'say', 'vincent', 'cite', 'bombardier', 'embraer', 'textron', 'example', 'point', 'already', 'see', 'beginning', 'second', 'wave', 'furlough', 'take', 'u', 'early', 'summer', 'month', 'say', 'even', 'manufacturer', 'somehow', 'get', 'back', 'building', 'vincent', 'say', 'challenge', 'persuade', 'customer', 'take', 'demo', 'attend', 'specification', 'session', 'chosen', 'model', 'deal', 'part', 'hardearned', 'capital', 'consequence', 'white', 'tail', 'complete', 'buyer', 'seem', 'likely', 'accumulate', 'yearend', 'vincent', 'warns', 'real', 'risk', 'delivery', 'number', 'especially', 'oems', 'seek', 'maintain', 'pricing', 'discipline', 'hold', 'line', 'discounting', 'say', 'expect', 'go', 'get', 'back', 'business', 'jet', 'delivery', 'trend', 'line', 'project', 'recently', 'month', 'ago', 'vincent', 'add', 'describes', 'coronavirus', 'crisis', 'black', 'swan', 'swan', 'far', 'pervasive', 'serious', 'anything', 'business', 'industry', 'participant', 'ever', 'see', 'although', 'industry', 'alone', 'suffer', 'search', 'pain', 'relief', 'get', 'back', 'semblance', 'normal', 'take', 'longer', 'u', 'like', 'imagine', 'endure', 'say', 'vincent', 'increase', 'caution', 'affect', 'preowned', 'market', 'report', 'record', 'total', 'unit', 'sale', 'april', 'equivalent', 'global', 'fleet', 'increase', 'period', 'firesale', 'number', 'stretch', 'imagination', 'although', 'pricing', 'valuation', 'precision', 'next', 'impossible', 'ascertain', 'current', 'environment', 'absence', 'preowned', 'transaction', 'say', 'vincent', 'plus', 'side', 'money', 'cheap', 'oems', 'product', 'sell', 'residual', 'value', 'inflate', 'previous', 'economic', 'crisis', 'say', 'operation', 'side', 'gloomy', 'hour', 'flown', 'usa', 'alone', 'day', 'end', 'april', 'say', 'report', 'next', 'month', 'go', 'particularly', 'quiet', 'business', 'industry', 'vincent', 'hopeful', 'semblance', 'initial', 'recovery', 'fourth', 'quarter', 'bad', 'coronavirus', 'impact', 'subside', 'highly', 'contentious', 'u', 'presidential', 'election', 'begin', 'see', 'benefit', 'massive', 'wave', 'government', 'intervention', 'stabilisation', 'stimulus', 'investment', 'begin', 'soon', 'go', 'tough', 'say', 'vincent', 'cite', 'economic', 'forecast', 'suddenly', 'call', 'broad', 'global', 'recession', 'include', 'forecast', 'gdp', 'growth', 'usa', 'spring', 'back', 'begin', 'later', 'continue', 'expect', 'operation', 'charter', 'fractional', 'ownership', 'corporate', 'fly', 'preowned', 'transaction', 'bounce', 'back', 'fairly', 'quickly', 'supply', 'demand', 'force', 'restabilise', 'business', 'consumer', 'confidence', 'rebuilds', 'reduce', 'schedule', 'go', 'forward', 'likely', 'go', 'look', 'well', 'secure', 'way', 'move', 'people', 'place', 'place', 'business', 'charter', 'provider', 'particular', 'beneficiary', 'say', 'vincent']"
"US president Donald Trump has announced plans to temporarily halt all immigration to the USA, as the country grapples with the coronavirus epidemic. It is unclear what, if any, immediate impact the move will have on international airlines, which are largely unable to fly to the country at the moment due to Covid-19-related travel restrictions and border closures. In a message posted on Twitter on 20 April, the president wrote that he would sign an executive order to temporarily suspend immigration into the country. He said he was taking the step “in light of the attack from the invisible enemy, as well as the need to protect the jobs” of American citizens. No further details have been disclosed as to how or when the suspension would take effect. IATA does not expect any immediate impact on airlines. The trade association says: “Details have yet to be released following President Trump's announcement on suspending immigration. But at present any such move would have no immediate impact as US borders are effectively closed to international visitors.” The USA has more than 42,000 confirmed Covid-19 deaths, according to data from Johns Hopkins University's Coronavirus Resource Centre, significantly more than any other country",4,293,12.0,0.2525,"travel, government, country, coronavirus, measure, restriction, passenger, state, march, canada","['u', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'announce', 'plan', 'temporarily', 'halt', 'immigration', 'usa', 'country', 'grapple', 'coronavirus', 'epidemic', 'unclear', 'immediate', 'impact', 'move', 'international', 'largely', 'unable', 'fly', 'country', 'moment', 'due', 'coronavirusrelated', 'travel', 'restriction', 'border', 'closure', 'message', 'post', 'twitter', 'april', 'president', 'write', 'sign', 'executive', 'order', 'temporarily', 'suspend', 'immigration', 'country', 'say', 'take', 'step', 'light', 'attack', 'invisible', 'enemy', 'well', 'need', 'protect', 'job', 'american', 'citizen', 'far', 'detail', 'disclose', 'suspension', 'take', 'effect', 'iata', 'expect', 'immediate', 'impact', 'trade', 'association', 'say', 'detail', 'yet', 'release', 'follow', 'president', 'trump', 'announcement', 'suspend', 'immigration', 'present', 'move', 'immediate', 'impact', 'u', 'border', 'effectively', 'close', 'international', 'usa', 'confirm', 'coronavirus', 'death', 'accord', 'data', 'john', 'hopkins', 'university', 'coronavirus', 'resource', 'centre', 'significantly', 'country']"
"The imposition of social-distancing measures on commercial flights would mean an end to “cheap travel”, according to IATA director general Alexandre de Juniac. “It is very clear that if social-distancing is imposed inside the aircraft it will neutralise a huge proportion of seats – at least a third – for short- and mid-haul aircraft,” de Juniac states during a briefing by the airline industry association today. The former Air France-KLM chief executive notes that break-even load factors on short-haul routes are typically in the low 70s in percentage terms – an unachievable target should social-distancing requirements mean, for example, that carriers must leave every middle seat empty in a 3-3 formation. Consequently, de Juniac explains, “if you are selling the ticket at the same average price as before, then you lose an enormous amount of money” in that theoretical scenario. He describes this as an “impossible” situation for any airline, “particularly the low-cost [carriers]”. One solution would be that “if the ticket price is increased by 50% then you are able to fly with a minimum profit”, he suggests. Ultimately, however, “if social-distancing is imposed, cheap travel is over”, de Juniac states. During the same briefing, IATA chief economist Brian Pearce notes that the need for social-distancing on flights is not guaranteed and “will really depend...on health requirements” imposed by governments as travel restrictions are lifted. On 14 April, IATA released a revised forecast suggesting airlines would lose $314 billion in passenger revenue this year amid the coronavirus outbreak, a fall of 55% from their 2019 income.",4,294,9.0,0.3344,"industry, crisis, demand, coronavirus, global, iata, market, level, cargo, expect","['imposition', 'socialdistancing', 'measure', 'commercial', 'mean', 'end', 'cheap', 'travel', 'accord', 'iata', 'director', 'general', 'alexandre', 'de', 'juniac', 'clear', 'socialdistancing', 'impose', 'inside', 'neutralise', 'huge', 'proportion', 'seat', 'least', 'third', 'short', 'midhaul', 'de', 'juniac', 'state', 'briefing', 'industry', 'association', 'today', 'former', 'franceklm', 'chief', 'executive', 'note', 'breakeven', 'load', 'factor', 'shorthaul', 'route', 'typically', 'low', 'percentage', 'term', 'unachievable', 'target', 'socialdistancing', 'requirement', 'mean', 'example', 'carrier', 'must', 'leave', 'every', 'middle', 'seat', 'empty', 'formation', 'consequently', 'de', 'juniac', 'explains', 'sell', 'ticket', 'average', 'price', 'lose', 'enormous', 'amount', 'money', 'theoretical', 'scenario', 'describes', 'impossible', 'situation', 'particularly', 'lowcost', 'carrier', 'solution', 'ticket', 'price', 'increase', 'able', 'fly', 'minimum', 'profit', 'suggests', 'ultimately', 'however', 'socialdistancing', 'impose', 'cheap', 'travel', 'de', 'juniac', 'state', 'briefing', 'iata', 'chief', 'economist', 'brian', 'pearce', 'note', 'need', 'socialdistancing', 'guaranteed', 'really', 'depend', 'health', 'requirement', 'impose', 'government', 'travel', 'restriction', 'lift', 'april', 'iata', 'release', 'revise', 'forecast', 'suggest', 'lose', 'passenger', 'revenue', 'amid', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'fall', 'income']"
"Consolidation among Chinese carriers appears likely, given the “unprecedented challenges” that the global airline industry is facing. A HSBC Global Research report into the Chinese airline industry says it does not “rule out the possibility of further consolidation”, adding that the three largest Chinese carriers – Air China, China Southern Airlines and China Eastern Airlines – would likely lead such efforts. The report flagged China's fourth largest carrier Hainan Airlines as a key target for consolidation, given its well-documented financial troubles over the past year. Media reports earlier this year have suggested that one, or more, of the three largest Chinese carriers might absorb Hainan's operations. This was after its parent company, the HNA Group, sought help from the Hainan state government. The HSBC report did not list any other carriers that could face merger or consolidation. It notes that the three largest carriers have had a history of consolidating operations within Mainland China. China's “Big three” undertook a massive merger spree in the early 2000s, after the September 11 attacks and under the Chinese government's consolidation plan. Air China, for instance, acquired a 22.8% stake in Shandong Airlines in 2004, three years after it bought over Zhejiang Airlines and merged its operations. China Eastern itself bought over Shanghai Airlines' operations in 2009, but kept the latter's branding. It absorbed the operations of China Yunnan and China Northwest Airlines in 2003.

"United Airlines has reported a preliminary pre-tax loss of $2.1 billion for the first quarter of 2020 and a $1 billion pre-tax loss on an adjusted basis. Total revenue in the first quarter declined by 17% compared to the first quarter of 2019, the Chicago-based airline stated in a 20 April US Securities and Exchange Commission filing. United also said in the SEC filing that on 17 April it applied for a CARES Act loan. The carrier expects to be able to borrow up to approximately $4.5 billion from the US treasury department for a term of up to five years. The CARES Act authorises the treasury department to make available to passenger air carriers $25 billion in loans, loan guarantees and other investments to provide liquidity that would assist them in the management of losses incurred as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. United stated on 20 April that if it ultimately borrows $4.5 billion through the CARES Act loan programme it would “issue warrants to purchase approximately 14.2 million shares of UAL common stock at a strike price of $31.50 per share (which was the closing price of UAL's common stock on the Nasdaq stock market on April 9, 2020), on the same terms as the warrants expected to be issued under the Payroll Support Program”. United announced on 15 April that it would receive $5 billion through the CARES Act's Payroll Support Program. Of that $5 billion, $3.5 billion will be outright grants and an additional $1.5 billion will be in low-interest loans.United expects to issue to the federal government warrants to purchase approximately 4.6 million shares of common stock through the Payroll Support Program. As of 16 April,United's short-term liquidity stands at around $6.3 billion, including $2 billion under its undrawn revolving credit facility.

"Falling demand for new aircraft has prompted the major Russian metals producer VSMPO-Avisma to cut the quantity of titanium output by about a third this year. The company is a key supplier to the aerospace industry – including Boeing and Airbus – providing the materials for such assemblies as landing-gear, wing structures and engine pylons. But the coronavirus situation has depleted the production demand for new aircraft and the Russian firm says it will be cutting titanium product manufacture to 26,500t this year, down from the planned 39,000t. The Avisma division will also cut production of sponge titanium from 44,000t to 35,000t. “We could, of course, stay in the same state for several months and – pretending that the problem does not exist – live beyond our means,” says chief executive Mikhail Voeyodin. “But there will come a time when the decline in numbers will become inevitable. We do not want such a development of events.” He is confident that the company will be able to adapt to an “anti-crisis” strategy similar to that adopted in 2009.

"HAECO's cabin solutions unit has launched a new stowage concept which will allow airlines to combine passengers and cargo in the main cabin. The concept comes amid depressed passenger traffic due to the coronavirus outbreak, which has led to a growing number of carriers using passenger aircraft to fly freight only. In all, HAECO is offering four different solutions, each with varying maximum load limits from 1,000 lbs (454kg) to 240 lbs. They range from a palletised variant, to a “seat and floor” storage version – which allows airlines to mount packages on the aircraft seats, or on the floor space in front of it. “These options give airlines specific load authorisations and the capability of carrying larger items in the cabin that otherwise would have been stored in the aircraft's belly, except for hazardous materials,” the company states. It also “[allows] airlines to carry cargo and passengers at the same time, optimising passenger and cargo yield, using packages to distance passengers, and maintaining proper weight and balance requirements”, HAECO adds. The solutions will be certified through a Supplemental Type Certificate in under a month, and can be delivered in four to six weeks, the company says. They can be installed on both narrow- and widebody aircraft, with the installation process following techniques used for installing economy seating. HAECO adds that it has seen interest from airlines for the concept, but did not specify which carriers they were. Airlines such as Finnair and Air Canada have in recent days converted their passenger aircraft cabins to be able to carry freight, amid growing demand for cargo and medical supplies.",4,298,3.0,0.1602,"passenger, loss, operating, revenue, traffic, month, increase, capacity, decline, result","['haeco', 'cabin', 'solution', 'unit', 'launch', 'stowage', 'concept', 'allow', 'combine', 'passenger', 'cargo', 'main', 'cabin', 'concept', 'come', 'amid', 'depressed', 'passenger', 'traffic', 'due', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'lead', 'grow', 'number', 'carrier', 'use', 'passenger', 'fly', 'freight', 'haeco', 'offering', 'different', 'solution', 'vary', 'maximum', 'load', 'limit', 'lb', 'lb', 'range', 'palletised', 'variant', 'seat', 'floor', 'storage', 'version', 'allows', 'mount', 'package', 'seat', 'floor', 'space', 'front', 'option', 'give', 'specific', 'load', 'authorisation', 'capability', 'carry', 'large', 'item', 'cabin', 'otherwise', 'store', 'belly', 'except', 'hazardous', 'material', 'state', 'allows', 'carry', 'cargo', 'passenger', 'optimise', 'passenger', 'cargo', 'yield', 'use', 'package', 'distance', 'passenger', 'maintain', 'proper', 'weight', 'balance', 'requirement', 'haeco', 'add', 'solution', 'certify', 'supplemental', 'type', 'certificate', 'month', 'deliver', 'week', 'say', 'instal', 'narrow', 'widebody', 'installation', 'process', 'follow', 'technique', 'use', 'instal', 'economy', 'seat', 'haeco', 'add', 'see', 'interest', 'concept', 'specify', 'carrier', 'finnair', 'canada', 'recent', 'day', 'convert', 'passenger', 'cabin', 'able', 'carry', 'freight', 'amid', 'grow', 'demand', 'cargo', 'medical', 'supply']"
"All Nippon Airways' parent company has revised down its financial results forecast for the fiscal year ended 31 March 2020, as the coronavirus outbreak batters air traffic. ANA Holdings expects operating revenues to come in at Y1.97 trillion ($18.3 billion), Y120 billion lower than the previous forecast disclosed on 29 October 2019 at the release of its half-year report. The company slashed its outlook for operating income from Y140 billion to Y60 billion. Projected net income now stands at Y27 billion, about a quarter of Y94 billion at the previous estimate. It says in a statement today: “As a result of entry restrictions in various countries and reduced domestic travel in Japan due to the spread of the coronavirus (Covid-19) during the fourth quarter, especially [as] the travel demand declined sharply in March, the operating revenues, operating income, ordinary income and net income attributable to owners of the parent are expected to be significantly lower than those in the previously revised forecast.” At the last forecast, the company cut its outlook for operating revenue by Y60 million, lowering operating profit and net profit by Y25 billion and Y14 billion, respectively.

"The AVIC Guizhou FTC-2000G has bagged its first export deal to an unnamed Southeast Asian country. The order was revealed in a report by the state-run Global Times newspaper that was also posted on the website of the Chinese defence ministry. The report suggests the first delivery will take place in 2021, with all examples to be delivered within a two-year period. No details were given about the deal's value or the number of aircraft involved. The story provided no details about the aircraft's planned weapons fit. The Global Times, cited unnamed “aviation experts” as saying the order presages a “surge in international customers.” While the customer was not named, Beijing is known to have close defence relations with two Southeast Asian countries, Myanmar and Cambodia. Cirium fleets data suggests that Myanmar has 74 fixed-wing aircraft of Chinese origin, of which 55 are combat aircraft. Chinese-built fighters in its arsenal include 21 Chengdu F-7s, six Guizhou FT-7s, 21 Hongdu A-5s, and seven Chendgu/Pakistan Aeronautical Complex JF-17s. Cambodia has a far more modest air force comprised mainly of helicopters, with no fixed-wing combat aircraft. The FTC-2000G is a based on the FTC-2000 advanced jet trainer. It made its public debut in the static park of Airshow China in Zhuhai in November 2018. It has seven hard points compared with five for the baseline FTC-2000, which is designated JL-9 in Chinese service. It is powered by a single Guizhou Liyang WP-13 engine equipped with an afterburner. At the 2018 show, the FTC-2000G appeared amid a range of air-to-air and air-to-surface weapons, such as the SD-10 semi-active air-to-air missile (the export variant of the PL-12), the CM-102 anti-radiation missile, and various guided and non-guided bombs.

"Two of China's largest airlines have warned of a “substantial loss” for their first-quarter financial results. Both China Eastern and China Southern Airlines flagged the financial hit in their monthly traffic results for March, where they note that even with “timely measures” taken to mitigate the of the coronavirus outbreak, a financial loss was inevitable. China Southern states that it had, in light of the pandemic, “actively responded” to market demand changes, and “vigorously reduced” costs. “However, in view of the severe impact of Covid-19 on the civil aviation industry, a substantial loss is expected for the Group's operating results in the first quarter of 2020 and will adversely affect the operating results in the first half of the year,” it adds. China Eastern echoed similar sentiments, adding: “[There] is still great uncertainty in the time span and severity of the epidemic around the world, which may magnify the impact on or result in a delay in the recovery of travel demand.” They join compatriot Air China, who in its 2019 annual results, warned of an operating loss “in the short term”. The dire pronouncements of the three biggest Chinese carriers are a far cry from their financial performance during the same period in 2019, where they each turned a profit. Air China reported a first-quarter profit of CNY3.98 billion ($562 million) in 2019. China Eastern posted an operating profit of CNY2.81 billion for the period, while China Southern saw a profit of CNY3.55 billion. Traffic results from the three Chinese carriers' for March tell two different stories. While overall figures were still depressed, domestic traffic largely saw signs of recovery, especially when compared to February. China Southern carried 3.75 million passengers for the month, a 69% decrease year-on-year. It was, however, more than twice the number carried in February. Domestic passengers accounted for the lion's share – at 3.61 million passengers. RPKs across the network fell 72% compared to the same month last year, led mainly by international and regional traffic. However, it was an 82% improvement from February. Overall ASKs for the month dropped 60.4%. When compared to February, it grew nearly 48%. The carrier reported passenger load factor to be at 58.2%, nearly 25 percentage points lower than 2019. As for China Eastern, it carried 2.26 million passengers for the month, a 79% drop year-on-year. This was, however, a higher figure compared to February, when it only carried 1.32 million. RPKs for the month tumbled 79%, while ASKs fell 69% year-on-year. Overall passenger load factor for the month came in at 55.8%, a drop of 27 percentage points compared to last year. Lastly, Air China carried 2.92 million passengers in March, a 69.1% decrease compared to last year. On a month-on-month basis, it was a 82.7% increase, led by a two-fold jump in domestic passenger numbers. RPKs for the month fell 73.5% year-on-year, while ASKs dropped 62.4%. However, when compared to February, both figures saw increases, with RPKs going up 38.6% and ASKs rising 25.5%. The Star Alliance carrier's overall passenger load factor fell nearly 24 percentage points to 56.8%.

"Qantas does not conceal its distaste for any state support tailored to its rival Virgin Australia, which recently requested a A$1.4 billion ($890 million) bailout from the federal government to ride out the coronavirus-induced downturn. Alan Joyce, Qantas's chief executive, said in a television interview on 20 March that it was not up to the government to pick “winners and losers” and that it should treat all carriers equally. On the same topic, Qantas has been quoted by various media as saying that if Virgin Australia gets that amount, then it should receive A$4.2 billion, if support is in proportion with the carriers' respective revenue figures. The war of words between the two carriers goes back a long way. Back in 2001, Qantas attacked the government's plans to support two rival domestic airlines – one an offshoot of collapsed rival Ansett and the other Virgin Blue, the predecessor to Virgin Australia. “The national interest will not be served by limiting Qantas's chances of success in an attempt to artificially prop up less competitive players,” said then-chief executive Geoff Dixon. STILL BITTER A decade later, Qantas's rival, now known as Virgin Australia, was back in its sights. In late 2013, Qantas took aim at Virgin Australia's plans to raise funds from its foreign owners, going so far as to launch an online petition. It said the market situation was unfair because its rival could raise foreign ownership without the need for any regulatory approval and still retain all the traffic rights given to Australian carriers. Meanwhile, foreign investment in Qantas was capped at 49%. Qantas said on the petition: “It means Virgin, which will be 80%-foreign owned, can use its unlimited funds to weaken Qantas in the domestic market and cripple our international business. It means foreign airlines having control of an airline which accesses Australia's valuable air treaty rights.” The row took another turn when Qantas started seeking government assistance of its own, reportedly via debt guarantees and, more importantly, through changes to the foreign ownership act. In early 2014, Richard Branson, Virgin Group founder and a shareholder in Virgin Australia, took out full-page advertisements in a number of Australian newspapers to protest suggestions that the national government could offer financial assistance to Qantas. Branson said at the time: “Qantas has gone cap in hand to the government. If the government fill their hat it will severely damage competition in Australia.” In the end, the government changed the ownership rule, a move that Virgin Australia welcomed. TOKYO TUSSLE Closer to the present, the two sparred over slots to Tokyo Haneda airport in the second half of 2019. After Japan said it would award Australia two coveted daily slots to Tokyo Haneda, Qantas was quick off the mark with an application to use both. Hours after Qantas's submission was made public, Virgin Australia stepped into the fray, saying it wanted one of the slots. Qantas countered that it would be the only carrier ready to commence the new flights by the start of the northern-hemisphere summer scheduling season. In the end, a desire for more competition on the route prevailed and Australia's International Air Services Commission said the two carriers would each get a slot. It remains to be seen how the latest war of words will end. Virgin Australia has just extended a trading halt of its shares while it discusses financing and restructuring options. So far, it seems the government is not minded to provide the bailout Virgin Australia has requested, even though ministers have said Canberra wants a two-airline sector. The federal government has, however, announced several relief and assistance packages for the country's aviation sector – its latest move being to underwrite a minimal domestic network operated by both Qantas and Virgin Australia.

"WestJet will lay off 1,700 pilots across its mainline carrier, regional subsidiary Encore and low-cost carrier Swoop, while keeping them on payrolls through the duration of Canada's wage subsidy that ends in June. The Calgary-based airline tells Cirium that the layoffs will be staggered beginning on both 1 May and 1 June as “a last resort” in response to the coronavirus downturn. “WestJet is making difficult but necessary decisions to right-size our airline to weather the crisis,” the airline says. “These actions will play a crucial part in WestJet's ability to recover quickly and participate in Canada's economic recovery.” Employees will be listed as “inactive” but will receive payroll during the duration of Canada's stimulus program. The notification of these layoffs comes a week after WestJet pledged to rehire 6,400 employees by participating in the Canadian Emergency Wage Subsidy. That legislation became law on 11 April and subsidises 75% of an eligible company's wages for up to 12 weeks, retroactive to 15 March. The programme makes C$71 billion ($50.6 billion) available to companies that lost 15% of their year-over-year revenue during March due to coronavirus, and 30% of year-over-year revenue for April and May. WestJet's private equity owner Onex signaled its support for ultra-low-cost carrier Swoop during this crisis. Charles Duncan was appointed president of the carrier on 17 April and he continues to serve in his existing role as WestJet's executive vice-president in charge of cargo. “In spite of the current challenges in the market, we remain committed to the ultra-low-cost carrier model and believe it will be an important element of our future success,” Duncan states. Some analysts view Swoop as a hedge against other low-cost carriers British Colombia-based Flair Airlines or Kelowna-based Canada Jetlines.

"Investigators have determined that an Emirates Airbus A380 descended far below the glideslope at Moscow Domodedovo after its crew entered a rapid descent, erroneously believing the jet was too high for the correct approach path. It descended to 504ft above ground – with a rate of descent of 1,600ft/min – while still some 7.4nm from the threshold of runway 14R, in darkness, before the crew executed a go-around. The A380 lost a further 109ft, dipping to just 395ft, before climbing away, the aircraft's ground-proximity warning system having sounded 'terrain' and 'pull up' alerts. Analysis from the United Arab Emirates' General Civil Aviation Authority found that the aircraft had effectively been descending in pursuit of an imaginary glideslope after the crew's instruments indicated the A380 was above the correct descent path. This instrument reading had been false, because the aircraft was still outside of the zone of reliability for ILS signals and, as a result, was receiving noisy and inaccurate ILS data. Despite the signal's unreliability the first officer, who was flying, referred only to this glideslope deviation indication. The inquiry says he became “cognitively fixated” on the belief the aircraft was high, and opted to conduct a procedure to intercept the glideslope from above. The first officer “did not confirm” the aircraft's actual vertical position using other available sources, including the navigation display, approach chart, or pressure altitude indicator, says the inquiry. Had he done so, it adds, he would “most likely” not have carried out this intercept procedure. While cockpit-voice recorder information was unavailable, having been overwritten during the return service to Dubai, investigators have reconstructed the sequence leading up to the incident. The aircraft had been north of Domodedovo, on a south-west heading and was due to join the AO14K arrival pattern which would have involved flying over the AMTAM waypoint on the base leg and turning left onto the approach to runway 14R. But it was instead vectored along a parallel base leg which was some 2.9nm closer to the runway threshold. At the time the aircraft was flying at 3,250ft and its crew was offered a descent to 2,230ft (500m QFE) to establish on the localiser. To reduce the A380's altitude the crew switched to 'open descent' mode, which maintains idle thrust while maintaining a target speed – in this case 170kt – by adjusting pitch. As the aircraft neared 2,300ft, the first officer commenced the procedure to intercept the glideslope from above – setting a 2000ft/min rate of descent – perceiving that the aircraft was high on the approach while just a few seconds from capturing the localiser. But analysis of the situation has determined that the aircraft would have established on the localiser about 63s from the time the first officer commenced the procedure, and only if the aircraft had maintained its assigned altitude. This meant the interception procedure, which requires the aircraft to be already established on the localiser, was premature. The aircraft was still on the base leg and 2.6nm from the extended runway centreline. “The [first officer's] action in attempting to join the glideslope from above was because of the false indication that the aircraft was high due to the invalid glideslope deviation, and his perception that the aircraft would be established on the localiser very soon,” says the inquiry. “In fact, the actual aircraft position was already below the 3° glideslope, and the aircraft would have established on the localiser far beyond his expectation.” After initiating the interception procedure, the first officer focused on the A380's heading to establish on the localiser course as well as its configuration for landing, without monitoring the correct glide capture. “The displayed glideslope deviation crossed almost the full scale, from above to below, without engagement of the expected glideslope capture mode,” says the inquiry. It adds that the captain's role of monitoring pilot was not helped by the first officer's having “improvised” the interception, and states: “No action by either flightcrew member took place to stop the aircraft from descending.” As the A380 passed through 2,044ft pressure altitude, at 170kt, the radar controller ordered the crew to halt further descent, repeating the instruction three times and informing the pilots that the aircraft's transponder was showing 290m when the runway elevation was 180m – a difference of 590ft. At about this time the crew commenced a go-around. Investigators state that the crew also subsequently aborted a second approach before the aircraft landed on its third attempt. None of the 448 occupants of the aircraft (A6-EEZ), which was operating flight EK131 from Dubai on 10 September 2017, was injured during the incident.",4,304,7.0,0.6653,"crew, runway, inquiry, land, approach, accident, investigator, captain, incident, pilot","['investigator', 'determine', 'emirate', 'descend', 'far', 'glideslope', 'moscow', 'domodedovo', 'crew', 'enter', 'rapid', 'descent', 'erroneously', 'believe', 'jet', 'high', 'correct', 'approach', 'path', 'descend', 'ground', 'rate', 'descent', 'still', 'threshold', 'runway', 'darkness', 'crew', 'execute', 'goaround', 'lose', 'far', 'dip', 'climb', 'away', 'groundproximity', 'warn', 'system', 'sound', 'alert', 'analysis', 'united', 'arab', 'emirate', 'general', 'civil', 'authority', 'found', 'effectively', 'descend', 'pursuit', 'imaginary', 'glideslope', 'crew', 'instrument', 'indicate', 'correct', 'descent', 'path', 'instrument', 'reading', 'false', 'still', 'outside', 'zone', 'reliability', 'il', 'signal', 'result', 'receive', 'noisy', 'inaccurate', 'il', 'data', 'despite', 'signal', 'unreliability', 'officer', 'fly', 'refer', 'glideslope', 'deviation', 'indication', 'inquiry', 'say', 'become', 'cognitively', 'fixate', 'belief', 'high', 'opt', 'conduct', 'procedure', 'intercept', 'glideslope', 'officer', 'confirm', 'actual', 'vertical', 'position', 'use', 'available', 'source', 'include', 'navigation', 'display', 'approach', 'chart', 'pressure', 'altitude', 'indicator', 'say', 'inquiry', 'add', 'likely', 'carry', 'intercept', 'procedure', 'cockpitvoice', 'recorder', 'information', 'unavailable', 'overwritten', 'return', 'service', 'dubai', 'investigator', 'reconstruct', 'sequence', 'lead', 'incident', 'north', 'domodedovo', 'southwest', 'head', 'due', 'join', 'arrival', 'pattern', 'involve', 'fly', 'amtam', 'waypoint', 'base', 'leg', 'turn', 'left', 'onto', 'approach', 'runway', 'instead', 'vectored', 'along', 'parallel', 'base', 'leg', 'closer', 'runway', 'threshold', 'fly', 'crew', 'offer', 'descent', 'qfe', 'establish', 'localiser', 'reduce', 'altitude', 'crew', 'switch', 'descent', 'mode', 'maintains', 'idle', 'thrust', 'maintain', 'target', 'speed', 'case', 'adjust', 'pitch', 'near', 'officer', 'commenced', 'procedure', 'intercept', 'glideslope', 'set', 'rate', 'descent', 'perceive', 'high', 'approach', 'second', 'capture', 'localiser', 'analysis', 'situation', 'determine', 'establish', 'localiser', 'officer', 'commenced', 'procedure', 'maintain', 'assign', 'altitude', 'meant', 'interception', 'procedure', 'require', 'already', 'establish', 'localiser', 'premature', 'still', 'base', 'leg', 'extend', 'runway', 'centreline', 'officer', 'action', 'attempt', 'join', 'glideslope', 'false', 'indication', 'high', 'due', 'invalid', 'glideslope', 'deviation', 'perception', 'establish', 'localiser', 'soon', 'say', 'inquiry', 'fact', 'actual', 'position', 'already', 'glideslope', 'establish', 'localiser', 'far', 'beyond', 'initiate', 'interception', 'procedure', 'officer', 'focus', 'head', 'establish', 'localiser', 'course', 'well', 'configuration', 'land', 'without', 'monitoring', 'correct', 'glide', 'capture', 'displayed', 'glideslope', 'deviation', 'cross', 'almost', 'full', 'scale', 'without', 'engagement', 'expect', 'glideslope', 'capture', 'mode', 'say', 'inquiry', 'add', 'captain', 'role', 'monitoring', 'pilot', 'help', 'officer', 'improvised', 'interception', 'state', 'action', 'either', 'flightcrew', 'member', 'take', 'place', 'stop', 'pass', 'pressure', 'altitude', 'radar', 'controller', 'order', 'crew', 'halt', 'far', 'descent', 'repeat', 'instruction', 'inform', 'pilot', 'transponder', 'runway', 'elevation', 'difference', 'crew', 'commenced', 'goaround', 'investigator', 'state', 'crew', 'subsequently', 'aborted', 'second', 'approach', 'land', 'third', 'attempt', 'none', 'occupant', 'operating', 'dubai', 'september', 'injured', 'incident']"

"Operators of various Boeing aircraft types including the 787 and 777 are being warned of misleading pitch guidance during glideslope interference on ILS approaches. The US FAA is cautioning pilots over the use of autopilot flight-director systems for the twinjets – as well as the 747-400, 747-8, 757 and 767 – under such circumstances. It states that Boeing and relevant suppliers are working on software updates intended to correct possible “erroneous” guidance arising from glideslope “anomalies” during ILS approaches. The AFDS packages the crew's mode-control panel interface with the aircraft's autopilot flight-director computers. If crews follow misleading information from the AFDS after disengaging the autopilot, the aircraft could potentially enter “dangerously steep” approaches – potentially preceding a short landing – or an unusually long approach resulting in a late touchdown, says the FAA. It states that such deceptive information relating to pitch guidance has affected a number of aircraft when capturing or tracking the glideslope, according to operator in-service reports received. Investigations have revealed that this guidance occurred mainly during glideslope capture at the same time as ILS glideslope signal interference. Such interference typically occurs when vehicles or aircraft affect the localiser or glideslope signal. Boeing issued a notification last October setting out operational instructions for AFDS use when these signals are degraded or unstable, and advising of possible cockpit effects. “The operating instructions reinforce existing procedures and training,” the FAA says in a newly-issued special airworthiness information bulletin. While the FAA has stopped short of publishing an airworthiness directive, it is recommending that operators of the aircraft types involved incorporate the actions outlined by Boeing. It is also considering a possible installation mandate once corrective software is available.",4,308,7.0,0.3308,"crew, runway, inquiry, land, approach, accident, investigator, captain, incident, pilot","['operator', 'various', 'type', 'include', 'warn', 'mislead', 'pitch', 'guidance', 'glideslope', 'interference', 'il', 'approach', 'u', 'faa', 'caution', 'pilot', 'use', 'autopilot', 'flightdirector', 'system', 'twinjet', 'well', 'circumstance', 'state', 'relevant', 'supplier', 'work', 'software', 'update', 'intend', 'correct', 'possible', 'erroneous', 'guidance', 'arise', 'glideslope', 'anomaly', 'il', 'approach', 'afds', 'package', 'crew', 'modecontrol', 'panel', 'interface', 'autopilot', 'flightdirector', 'computer', 'crew', 'follow', 'mislead', 'information', 'afds', 'disengage', 'autopilot', 'potentially', 'enter', 'dangerously', 'steep', 'approach', 'potentially', 'precede', 'short', 'land', 'unusually', 'long', 'approach', 'result', 'late', 'touchdown', 'say', 'faa', 'state', 'deceptive', 'information', 'relate', 'pitch', 'guidance', 'affected', 'number', 'capture', 'track', 'glideslope', 'accord', 'operator', 'inservice', 'report', 'receive', 'investigation', 'reveal', 'guidance', 'occur', 'mainly', 'glideslope', 'capture', 'il', 'glideslope', 'signal', 'interference', 'interference', 'typically', 'occurs', 'vehicle', 'affect', 'localiser', 'glideslope', 'signal', 'issue', 'notification', 'october', 'set', 'operational', 'instruction', 'afds', 'use', 'signal', 'degrade', 'unstable', 'advise', 'possible', 'cockpit', 'effect', 'operating', 'instruction', 'reinforce', 'exist', 'procedure', 'training', 'faa', 'say', 'newlyissued', 'special', 'airworthiness', 'information', 'bulletin', 'faa', 'stop', 'short', 'publishing', 'airworthiness', 'directive', 'recommend', 'operator', 'type', 'involve', 'incorporate', 'action', 'outline', 'consider', 'possible', 'installation', 'mandate', 'corrective', 'software', 'available']"
"UK budget carrier EasyJet is arguing that it cannot terminate its contentious Airbus order by falling back on the argument that the coronavirus outbreak is a situation beyond its control. The airline has been under fire from its founder, and key shareholder, Stelios Haji-Ioannou over the cost of retaining the order and has been coercing the management team – with threats to remove board members – to cancel the Airbus agreement by claiming 'force majeure'. EasyJet insists it has “no ability” to terminate the contract this way. “This is standard in aircraft purchase contracts,” it says. But it adds that there would be ramifications if it pursued such a cancellation. EasyJet argues that it would become liable for “significant” compensation linked to discounts on aircraft already delivered under the same contract as those which are outstanding. The airline ordered 135 Airbus jets in 2013 and says 45 aircraft from the contract have since been received. It adds that it would also be liable for any future losses the airframer could prove resulted from cancellation, and that the cost of direct manufacturer support for the operation of EasyJet's current fleet would also rise substantially. This is because, it says, it would need to purchase training, software and other support directly from a single-source supplier while also losing access to long-term performance guarantees. EasyJet has agreed to defer delivery of 24 aircraft – with the option of shifting another five – over the next three years including all 12 scheduled to arrive in its 2020-21 fiscal year. “Exact dates of future deliveries of the deferred aircraft are to be agreed in response to the demand environment,” the airline states. It adds that it has additional fleet flexibility over the next 16 months arising from operating leases on another 24 jets which will fall due for renewal. EasyJet's fleet plan, taking into account the measures, will give the airline between 281 and 353 aircraft by September 2023, compared with the previous range of 304-383. This appears unlikely to appease Haji-Ioannou who continues to accuse the airline's management of making a “deliberate mistake” by affirming the Airbus agreement. “Any attempt to operate a fleet of more than 250 aircraft – down from 337 now – is bound to just burn a shed-load of cash in 2021,” he argues. He has stepped up his attack on the board, calling for the removal of chief executive Johan Lundgren as well as chairman John Barton, along with two other directors, and proposing that chief operating officer Peter Bellew – formerly of rival Ryanair – takes over.",4,309,8.0,0.2966,"government, uk, carrier, business, state, share, south, airway, financial, plan","['uk', 'budget', 'carrier', 'easyjet', 'argue', 'terminate', 'contentious', 'order', 'fall', 'back', 'argument', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'situation', 'beyond', 'control', 'fire', 'founder', 'key', 'shareholder', 'stelios', 'hajiioannou', 'cost', 'retain', 'order', 'coerce', 'management', 'team', 'threat', 'remove', 'board', 'member', 'cancel', 'agreement', 'claim', 'majeure', 'easyjet', 'insists', 'ability', 'terminate', 'contract', 'way', 'standard', 'purchase', 'contract', 'say', 'add', 'ramification', 'pursue', 'cancellation', 'easyjet', 'argues', 'become', 'liable', 'significant', 'compensation', 'link', 'discount', 'already', 'deliver', 'contract', 'outstanding', 'order', 'jet', 'say', 'contract', 'since', 'receive', 'add', 'liable', 'future', 'loss', 'airframer', 'prove', 'result', 'cancellation', 'cost', 'direct', 'manufacturer', 'support', 'operation', 'easyjet', 'current', 'fleet', 'rise', 'substantially', 'say', 'need', 'purchase', 'training', 'software', 'support', 'directly', 'singlesource', 'supplier', 'lose', 'access', 'longterm', 'performance', 'guarantee', 'easyjet', 'agree', 'defer', 'delivery', 'option', 'shift', 'another', 'next', 'include', 'schedule', 'arrive', 'fiscal', 'exact', 'date', 'future', 'delivery', 'defer', 'agree', 'response', 'demand', 'environment', 'state', 'add', 'additional', 'fleet', 'flexibility', 'next', 'month', 'arise', 'operating', 'lease', 'another', 'jet', 'fall', 'due', 'renewal', 'easyjet', 'fleet', 'plan', 'take', 'account', 'measure', 'give', 'september', 'compare', 'previous', 'range', 'appear', 'unlikely', 'appease', 'hajiioannou', 'continue', 'accuse', 'management', 'make', 'deliberate', 'mistake', 'affirm', 'agreement', 'attempt', 'operate', 'fleet', 'bound', 'burn', 'shedload', 'cash', 'argues', 'step', 'attack', 'board', 'call', 'removal', 'chief', 'executive', 'johan', 'lundgren', 'well', 'chairman', 'john', 'barton', 'along', 'director', 'propose', 'chief', 'operating', 'officer', 'peter', 'bellew', 'formerly', 'rival', 'ryanair', 'take']"
"March proved to be yet another month of weak traffic figures for Cathay Pacific, which states that it is “impossible to predict” when passenger demand will recover from the coronavirus crisis. Commenting on its traffic results for March, Cathay adds that it is not seeing any improvement so far in passenger bookings and anticipates carrying less than 1,000 passengers a day in April. This is significantly lower than the 100,000 passengers it used to carry daily. For the month of March, Cathay and Cathay Dragon carried just over 311,000 passengers, a 90% decrease year-on-year. RPKs dropped 84.3%, while ASKs fell 73.2%, both led by deep cuts to mainland China and Northeast Asia. Overall passenger load factor for the month tumbled 34.6 percentage points to 49.3%. Cathay group chief customer and commercial officer Ronald Lam says: “Passenger demand dropped rapidly and tremendously in late March following the introduction of arrival restrictions on all non-resident visitors to Hong Kong, including transit passengers. On each of the last two days of March we carried fewer than 1,000 passengers only.” The reduction in passenger flight capacity has had a knock-on effect on Cathay's cargo traffic results, Lam adds. The carrier saw cargo volumes for the month dip 35.6%, but load factor and yield went up because of reduced air cargo capacity in the global market. In its outlook, the carrier says it will maintain its “bare skeleton” schedule into May, operating at just 3% of regular capacity. Adds Lam: “We are doing everything we can to reduce our expenditure and preserve cash for the coming months.”",4,310,3.0,0.3843,"passenger, loss, operating, revenue, traffic, month, increase, capacity, decline, result","['march', 'prove', 'yet', 'another', 'month', 'weak', 'traffic', 'figure', 'cathay', 'pacific', 'state', 'impossible', 'predict', 'passenger', 'demand', 'recover', 'coronavirus', 'crisis', 'comment', 'traffic', 'result', 'march', 'cathay', 'add', 'see', 'improvement', 'far', 'passenger', 'booking', 'anticipates', 'carry', 'less', 'passenger', 'day', 'april', 'significantly', 'low', 'passenger', 'use', 'carry', 'daily', 'month', 'march', 'cathay', 'cathay', 'dragon', 'carry', 'passenger', 'decrease', 'yearonyear', 'rpks', 'drop', 'asks', 'fell', 'lead', 'deep', 'cut', 'mainland', 'northeast', 'asia', 'overall', 'passenger', 'load', 'factor', 'month', 'tumble', 'percentage', 'point', 'cathay', 'chief', 'customer', 'commercial', 'officer', 'ronald', 'lam', 'say', 'passenger', 'demand', 'drop', 'rapidly', 'tremendously', 'late', 'march', 'follow', 'introduction', 'arrival', 'restriction', 'nonresident', 'visitor', 'hong', 'kong', 'include', 'transit', 'passenger', 'day', 'march', 'carry', 'passenger', 'reduction', 'passenger', 'capacity', 'knockon', 'effect', 'cathay', 'cargo', 'traffic', 'result', 'lam', 'add', 'carrier', 'saw', 'cargo', 'volume', 'month', 'dip', 'load', 'factor', 'yield', 'go', 'reduce', 'cargo', 'capacity', 'global', 'market', 'outlook', 'carrier', 'say', 'maintain', 'bare', 'skeleton', 'schedule', 'may', 'operating', 'regular', 'capacity', 'add', 'lam', 'everything', 'reduce', 'expenditure', 'preserve', 'cash', 'come', 'month']"
"The lack of commercial flights due to the Covid-19 crisis is not only a problem for the aviation industry but also has weather forecasters concerned. Sensors, computers and communications systems onboard commercial jets automatically collect and transmit meteorological observations to ground stations, which have been curtailed by the sharp decline in air traffic. “In-flight measurements of ambient temperature and wind speed and direction are a very important source of information for both weather prediction and climate monitoring,” the World Meteorological Organization states. The Geneva-based UN specialised agency says 43 airlines and several thousand aircraft contribute to the Aircraft Meteorological Data Relay programme (AMDAR), producing over 800,000 daily observations such as air temperature, wind speed and direction, humidity and even turbulence. In Europe, contributing airlines include Aer Lingus, Air France, British Airways, easyJet, Finnair, KLM, Lufthansa, Turkish Airlines, SAS and Wizz Air. However, with airlines worldwide grounding most of their fleets due to coronavirus-related travel restrictions, those observations are also down. WMO says that in many parts of the world, over Europe and the USA in particular, the number of observations from aircraft is down anywhere from 50% to over 80%. Lars Peter Riishojgaard, director, Earth System Branch in WMO's Infrastructure Department, said: “At the present time, the adverse impact of the loss of observations on the quality of weather forecast products is still expected to be relatively modest. However, as the decrease in availability of aircraft weather observations continues and expands, we may expect a gradual decrease in reliability of the forecasts.” Besides aircraft observations, the WMO also uses satellites, ground stations, surface monitoring systems and marine-based platforms to gather meteorological data. To try and compensate for the lack of aircraft observations, some WMO member states, especially in Europe, are sending up more radiosondes on weather balloons to take meteorological readings.",4,311,1.0,0.2319,"test, force, helicopter, fire, system, service, attack, design, usaf, missile","['lack', 'commercial', 'due', 'coronavirus', 'crisis', 'problem', 'industry', 'weather', 'forecaster', 'concerned', 'sensor', 'computer', 'communication', 'system', 'onboard', 'commercial', 'jet', 'automatically', 'collect', 'transmit', 'meteorological', 'observation', 'ground', 'station', 'curtail', 'sharp', 'decline', 'traffic', 'inflight', 'measurement', 'ambient', 'temperature', 'wind', 'speed', 'direction', 'important', 'source', 'information', 'weather', 'prediction', 'climate', 'monitoring', 'world', 'meteorological', 'organization', 'state', 'genevabased', 'un', 'specialise', 'agency', 'say', 'several', 'thousand', 'contribute', 'meteorological', 'data', 'relay', 'programme', 'amdar', 'produce', 'daily', 'observation', 'temperature', 'wind', 'speed', 'direction', 'humidity', 'even', 'turbulence', 'europe', 'contribute', 'include', 'aer', 'lingus', 'france', 'british', 'airway', 'easyjet', 'finnair', 'klm', 'lufthansa', 'turkish', 'sa', 'wizz', 'however', 'worldwide', 'ground', 'fleet', 'due', 'coronavirusrelated', 'travel', 'restriction', 'observation', 'wmo', 'say', 'many', 'part', 'world', 'europe', 'usa', 'particular', 'number', 'observation', 'anywhere', 'lars', 'peter', 'riishojgaard', 'director', 'earth', 'system', 'branch', 'wmo', 'infrastructure', 'department', 'say', 'present', 'adverse', 'impact', 'loss', 'observation', 'quality', 'weather', 'forecast', 'product', 'still', 'expect', 'relatively', 'modest', 'however', 'decrease', 'availability', 'weather', 'observation', 'continue', 'expands', 'may', 'expect', 'gradual', 'decrease', 'reliability', 'besides', 'observation', 'wmo', 'satellite', 'ground', 'station', 'surface', 'monitoring', 'system', 'marinebased', 'platform', 'gather', 'meteorological', 'data', 'try', 'compensate', 'lack', 'observation', 'wmo', 'member', 'state', 'especially', 'europe', 'send', 'radiosondes', 'weather', 'balloon', 'take', 'meteorological', 'reading']"
"Singapore Airlines Group expects to extend capacity cuts and warns of material impact to its financial performance in the quarter ended 31 March. Singapore banned short-term visitors from entering or transiting from 24 March, and the group said in a stock-exchange disclosure on 15 April that “capacity was further rationalised in response”. By the end of March, SIA and SilkAir's combined capacity was reduced by 96% while Scoot suspended 98% of its network until the end of April. Then, the group said it will ground 138 of 147 aircraft operated by SIA and SilkAir, as well as all but two of Scoot's 49 aircraft. SIA Group says in the latest statement: “Looking forward, the group may need to extend these capacity cuts if border controls and travel restrictions remain in place and travel demand continues to be low. Operating this limited schedule will have a severe impact on the group's financial performance.” While its cargo demand has held up and freighter aircraft operate as planned, SIA Group says the reduction in passenger operations has significantly reduced overall cargo capacity. It has therefore been selectively deploying passenger aircraft on cargo-only flights to meet demand from global supply chains. Cirium fleets data shows that SIA Group has seven Boeing 747-400 freighters in its fleet. For the month of March, the group's RPKs declined by 60.4% year-on-year, and against a 43.8% decline in capacity, passenger load factor was down 24.1 percentage points to 57.4%. FTK was 28.8% lower versus a 34.7% drop in capacity, pushing cargo load factor up by 5.7 percentage points to 68.2%. SIA Group says the collapse in passenger traffic has a severe impact on its revenues and it expects a material impact on the group's financial performance in the recently concluded quarter. “While the capacity cuts and other cost management measures that SIA has implemented have helped to reduce expenditure, many costs are unavoidable regardless of the number of flights mounted. That means these measures will not fully offset the contraction in passenger revenue.” The oil price shock has also added to its woes, and the group states that given the scale of flight cuts, it is now in an over-hedged position with respect to fuel consumption. It says: “Surplus hedges will need to be marked to market as at 31 March 2020, a date on which the Brent oil price was close to its 10-year low, and are expected to generate substantial losses.” In its annual report for financial year (FY) 2019,SIAstated: “As at 31 March 2019, the group had entered into longer [D]ated Brent hedges with maturities extending to FY2024/25 that cover up to 46% of the group's projected annual fuel consumption, at average prices ranging from $58-63 per barrel.” Commenting on the group's sensitivity to jet fuel price, the same report says that a $1 per barrel increase in the price of jet fuel had a S$56.7 million ($40 million) impact on the group's annual fuel costs that year, excluding the effects of hedging and assuming all factors such as the amount of fuel uplift and fuel surcharges are kept constant.",4,312,3.0,0.4411,"passenger, loss, operating, revenue, traffic, month, increase, capacity, decline, result","['singapore', 'expect', 'extend', 'capacity', 'cut', 'warns', 'material', 'impact', 'financial', 'performance', 'quarter', 'end', 'march', 'singapore', 'ban', 'shortterm', 'visitor', 'enter', 'transit', 'march', 'say', 'stockexchange', 'disclosure', 'april', 'capacity', 'far', 'rationalise', 'response', 'end', 'march', 'sia', 'silkair', 'combine', 'capacity', 'reduce', 'scoot', 'suspend', 'network', 'end', 'april', 'say', 'ground', 'operate', 'sia', 'silkair', 'well', 'scoot', 'sia', 'say', 'late', 'statement', 'look', 'forward', 'may', 'need', 'extend', 'capacity', 'cut', 'border', 'control', 'travel', 'restriction', 'remain', 'place', 'travel', 'demand', 'continue', 'low', 'operating', 'limited', 'schedule', 'severe', 'impact', 'financial', 'cargo', 'demand', 'held', 'freighter', 'operate', 'plan', 'sia', 'say', 'reduction', 'passenger', 'operation', 'significantly', 'reduce', 'overall', 'cargo', 'capacity', 'therefore', 'selectively', 'deploy', 'passenger', 'cargoonly', 'meet', 'demand', 'global', 'supply', 'chain', 'fleet', 'data', 'sia', 'freighter', 'fleet', 'month', 'march', 'rpks', 'decline', 'yearonyear', 'decline', 'capacity', 'passenger', 'load', 'factor', 'percentage', 'point', 'ftk', 'low', 'versus', 'drop', 'capacity', 'push', 'cargo', 'load', 'factor', 'percentage', 'point', 'sia', 'say', 'collapse', 'passenger', 'traffic', 'severe', 'impact', 'revenue', 'expect', 'material', 'impact', 'financial', 'performance', 'recently', 'conclude', 'quarter', 'capacity', 'cut', 'cost', 'management', 'measure', 'sia', 'implement', 'help', 'reduce', 'expenditure', 'many', 'cost', 'unavoidable', 'regardless', 'number', 'mount', 'mean', 'measure', 'fully', 'offset', 'contraction', 'passenger', 'oil', 'price', 'shock', 'add', 'woe', 'state', 'give', 'scale', 'cut', 'overhedged', 'position', 'respect', 'fuel', 'consumption', 'say', 'surplus', 'hedge', 'need', 'marked', 'market', 'march', 'date', 'brent', 'oil', 'price', 'close', 'low', 'expect', 'generate', 'substantial', 'annual', 'report', 'financial', 'fy', 'siastated', 'march', 'enter', 'longer', 'ated', 'brent', 'hedge', 'maturity', 'extend', 'cover', 'project', 'annual', 'fuel', 'consumption', 'average', 'price', 'range', 'per', 'comment', 'sensitivity', 'jet', 'fuel', 'price', 'report', 'say', 'per', 'barrel', 'increase', 'price', 'jet', 'fuel', 'impact', 'annual', 'fuel', 'cost', 'exclude', 'effect', 'hedge', 'assume', 'factor', 'amount', 'fuel', 'uplift', 'fuel', 'surcharge', 'kept', 'constant']"
"The current industry slump may push some aerospace suppliers out of business, and the recovery may come slow due to public wariness of close quarters in aircraft cabins, say industry experts. However, those experts remain optimistic about the sector's longer-term prospects, saying the industry will recover and that the downturn may spark innovation and revenue diversification. “There will be, certainty among the smaller companies, consolidation...They won't have capital to get through this,” Jack Pelton, chief executive of Experimental Aircraft Association and former Cessna CEO, says during a FlightGlobal webinar on 16 April. “Diversification – that's the lesson we always learn coming out” of downturns, he adds. Former Airbus chief operating officer Tom Williams calls the current downturn worse by “an order of magnitude” than previous slumps, such as those following the September 2001 terrorist attacks, the late 2000s financial crisis and previous disease outbreaks.  Safran Leap-1A nacelle Some suppliers, having seen their aerospace revenue shrink by half, might simply walk away from their aerospace businesses, choosing to focus on other non-aviation business units, Williams says. Aerospace suppliers typically require more time to ramp up operations – perhaps 12 to 18 months more – than do airframers, Williams adds. And the expense of ramping can be significant, meaning some suppliers might hang on through the downturn only to run out of cash while getting back on their feet. “You can go bust on the other side of the curve,” Williams says. He suspects systems suppliers might fare best, being generally well funded and having strong earnings, better access to capital and side revenue from aftermarket work. Aerostructures companies, which often have tighter margins and more-disperse supply chains, could struggle more. “Those are the ones I would lose the most sleep over,” Williams says. Many companies have already started cutting costs and trimming their workforce. While possibly unavoidable, staff cuts threaten to leave suppliers unable to hire enough skilled workers when the upturn takes hold, Williams says. But companies that keep idle employees on payroll face the same problem, as skilled workers, when unchallenged, are likely to take jobs elsewhere, he adds. Pelton warns of slashing spending on research and development, which is a common, almost kneejerk, reaction to downturns. But companies that defund such investment might struggle to compete in later years. “You pay for it down the road,” Pelton says, adding that product development spending will “separate the winners and losers long term”. Pelton also cautions companies to be realistic about their production capabilities in the early days of the eventual recovery, saying they must avoid promising more than they can deliver. “You certainly are not going to have the capacity to produce what you used to,” Pelton says. “You can overcommit...on the backside of this.” Even amid extreme uncertainty, Williams urges executives to communicate frequently with business partners and employees. “If you think you are 60% right, then you should go with that, and try to keep everyone aligned,” he says. “There is temptation to only communicate when you have all the answers. If you are not careful you will end up with a very ragged and uncontrolled situation.” Pelton doubts the aerospace industry will recover as quickly as it fell, noting that years of increasing production rates created oversupply. Since January the global in-service fleet of Boeing and Airbus aircraft has slipped some 62%, from 20,000 to 7,540 jets, according to Cirium fleets data. Also, Pelton says “paranoia” among the public about contagion will take time to overcome. “It's not going to be a sharp” recovery, he adds. “I think it's going to be much slower.” But Pelton and Williams remain confident in the industry's future, and suspect the downturn will spark innovative technologies, such as those related to emission reduction and aircraft sanitation. “This segment attracts some of the brightest minds. It will figure itself out. It will reinvent itself,” Pelton says.",4,313,0.0,0.299,"order, business, jet, delivery, production, customer, deliver, commercial, quarter, include","['current', 'industry', 'slump', 'may', 'push', 'supplier', 'business', 'recovery', 'may', 'come', 'slow', 'due', 'public', 'wariness', 'close', 'quarter', 'cabin', 'say', 'industry', 'expert', 'however', 'expert', 'remain', 'optimistic', 'sector', 'longerterm', 'prospect', 'say', 'industry', 'recover', 'downturn', 'may', 'spark', 'innovation', 'revenue', 'diversification', 'certainty', 'among', 'small', 'consolidation', 'wo', 'capital', 'get', 'jack', 'pelton', 'chief', 'executive', 'experimental', 'association', 'former', 'cessna', 'ceo', 'say', 'flightglobal', 'webinar', 'april', 'diversification', 'lesson', 'always', 'learn', 'come', 'downturn', 'add', 'former', 'chief', 'operating', 'officer', 'tom', 'williams', 'call', 'current', 'downturn', 'bad', 'order', 'magnitude', 'previous', 'slump', 'follow', 'september', 'terrorist', 'attack', 'late', 'financial', 'crisis', 'previous', 'disease', 'outbreak', 'safran', 'nacelle', 'supplier', 'see', 'revenue', 'shrink', 'half', 'might', 'simply', 'walk', 'away', 'business', 'choose', 'focus', 'nonaviation', 'business', 'unit', 'williams', 'say', 'supplier', 'typically', 'require', 'ramp', 'operation', 'perhaps', 'month', 'airframers', 'williams', 'add', 'expense', 'ramp', 'significant', 'meaning', 'supplier', 'might', 'hang', 'downturn', 'run', 'cash', 'get', 'back', 'foot', 'go', 'bust', 'side', 'curve', 'williams', 'say', 'suspect', 'system', 'supplier', 'might', 'fare', 'best', 'generally', 'well', 'fund', 'strong', 'earnings', 'well', 'access', 'capital', 'side', 'revenue', 'aftermarket', 'work', 'aerostructures', 'often', 'tighter', 'margin', 'moredisperse', 'supply', 'chain', 'struggle', 'lose', 'sleep', 'williams', 'say', 'many', 'already', 'start', 'cut', 'cost', 'trim', 'workforce', 'possibly', 'unavoidable', 'staff', 'cut', 'threaten', 'leave', 'supplier', 'unable', 'hire', 'enough', 'skilled', 'worker', 'upturn', 'take', 'hold', 'williams', 'say', 'keep', 'idle', 'employee', 'payroll', 'face', 'problem', 'skilled', 'worker', 'unchallenged', 'likely', 'take', 'job', 'elsewhere', 'add', 'pelton', 'warns', 'slash', 'spending', 'research', 'development', 'common', 'almost', 'kneejerk', 'reaction', 'downturn', 'defund', 'investment', 'might', 'struggle', 'compete', 'later', 'pay', 'road', 'pelton', 'say', 'add', 'product', 'development', 'spending', 'separate', 'winner', 'loser', 'long', 'term', 'pelton', 'caution', 'realistic', 'production', 'capability', 'early', 'day', 'eventual', 'recovery', 'say', 'must', 'avoid', 'promising', 'deliver', 'certainly', 'go', 'capacity', 'produce', 'use', 'pelton', 'say', 'overcommit', 'backside', 'even', 'amid', 'extreme', 'uncertainty', 'williams', 'urge', 'executive', 'communicate', 'frequently', 'business', 'partner', 'employee', 'think', 'right', 'go', 'try', 'keep', 'everyone', 'align', 'say', 'temptation', 'communicate', 'answer', 'careful', 'end', 'rag', 'uncontrolled', 'pelton', 'doubt', 'industry', 'recover', 'quickly', 'fell', 'note', 'increase', 'production', 'rate', 'create', 'oversupply', 'since', 'january', 'global', 'inservice', 'fleet', 'slip', 'jet', 'accord', 'fleet', 'data', 'pelton', 'say', 'paranoia', 'among', 'public', 'contagion', 'take', 'overcome', 'go', 'sharp', 'recovery', 'add', 'think', 'go', 'much', 'pelton', 'williams', 'remain', 'confident', 'industry', 'future', 'suspect', 'downturn', 'spark', 'innovative', 'technology', 'related', 'emission', 'reduction', 'sanitation', 'segment', 'attracts', 'brightest', 'mind', 'figure', 'reinvent', 'pelton', 'say']"
"The US Air Force (USAF) Boeing VC-25B executive transport has completed almost all of its critical design review with just a few outstanding issues to be resolved. The USAF aircraft, which is known by the call sign “Air Force One” when the US president flies aboard, received most of its critical design review virtually, as coronavirus restrictions prevented the entire development team from meeting in person, says Will Roper, assistant secretary of the USAF for acquisition technology and logistics, on 16 April. Instead, portions of the aircraft's design that were less secretive were reviewed using video and text chat programmes. The highly secretive parts of the presidential transport were reviewed in secure conference rooms by a smaller number of personnel, Roper says. Because of social distancing restrictions the number of people allowed into secure facilities was limited. “Lots of times people will be able to attend for their situational awareness, [but] we're not able to do that,” says Roper. A few small issues are holding the VC-25B from officially completing critical design review, though Roper says the snags should be easily and quickly overcome. “From the layman's point of view, it's complete,” he says. “From the acquisition professional's point of view, there are some links to close out.” The VC-25B programme, which is based in San Antonio, Texas, is actually benefiting from the coronavirus. “A lot of the engineers, tools and talent that would be dedicated to other commercial functions within Boeing have now been available to help that program,” says Roper, noting the company's commercial aircraft production is idled. “I don't see any slips right now [in schedule] for VC-25B because of Covid-19.” Completion of critical design review would clear the way for production to start on the VC-25B. The USAF has ordered two examples of the type, which is based on the 747-8 commercial airliner.

"Manchester airport in the UK is to modify a runway intersection after a second incident in which a business jet began its take-off roll lined up with the runway edge stripe rather than the centreline. Detailing the 12 March 2019 incident, the UK Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) says that several features of the runway, combined with light and meteorological conditions, were responsible for the confusion. Prior to receiving departure clearance at around 15:05, the Embraer Phenom 300 (D-COLT) was held at intersection J1, which faces traffic on approach to runway 23R. Although airport information charts note that the hold point is 200m (660ft) from the runway centerline, as the Phenom pilot taxied past the angled edge of the J intersection turning circle, “he perceived it to be the edge of the runway”, says the AAIB. “Then on sensing that the aircraft was running over runway lights, he thought the aircraft was on the centreline. He turned the aircraft accordingly and was facing the low sun as he began the take-off roll.” Although the Phenom pilot had departed from the airport on two previous occasions, he told the AAIB that he was more familiar with smaller airfields “with runway widths of less than 30m”, rather than Manchester's total paved width of 91m – including widened shoulders of 23m on either side of the side-stripe markings. The pilot “indicated that he was aware of the convex profile of Manchester's runway 23R but the 'picture' of what he thought was the lit centreline in front of him, with 23m of paved surface to the side, seemed normal to him,” says the AAIB. In addition, the low sun combined with a wet runway surface to further hamper the Phenom pilot's ability to accurately perceive his position. The pilot told the inquiry that he believed he was “distracted” by a request during line-up to perform a rolling take-off, with that also reducing “the opportunity to check his position”. In the event, an air traffic controller noticed the mistake – confirming it via surface movement radar – and cancelled the departure clearance for the twinjet, fearing that the runway shoulder's lower load-bearing strength could result in debris being thrown up. A rejected take-off was performed, while the Phenom was travelling at around 80-90kt (148-166km/h). In its analysis, the AAIB says the incident bears a strong similarity to an event in March 2018, when a Cessna Citation lined up on runway 23R via the J1 intersection and began its take-off roll “tracking the right runway side-stripe”. Although the controller – coincidentally the same individual involved in the D-COLT incident – attempted to alert the Cessna's crew, the use of an incorrect call-sign meant the business jet departed before any correction could be made, says the AAIB. It notes that in the light of the two events “the airport authority is implementing several safety actions to assist pilots lining up at [the] J1 [intersection]”. These include instating a “runway excursion” hotspot at the intersection, reconfiguring J1's lead-on lights so that they will always illuminate when its stop-bar is lowered, and applying green paint to the areas of the turning circle outside of the runway edge lighting to give the impression of grass.",4,315,7.0,0.5501,"crew, runway, inquiry, land, approach, accident, investigator, captain, incident, pilot","['manchester', 'airport', 'uk', 'modify', 'runway', 'intersection', 'second', 'incident', 'business', 'jet', 'begin', 'takeoff', 'roll', 'line', 'runway', 'edge', 'stripe', 'rather', 'centreline', 'detail', 'march', 'incident', 'uk', 'accident', 'investigation', 'branch', 'aaib', 'say', 'several', 'feature', 'runway', 'combine', 'light', 'meteorological', 'condition', 'responsible', 'confusion', 'prior', 'receive', 'departure', 'clearance', 'around', 'embraer', 'phenom', 'dcolt', 'held', 'intersection', 'face', 'traffic', 'approach', 'runway', 'although', 'airport', 'information', 'chart', 'note', 'hold', 'point', 'runway', 'centerline', 'phenom', 'pilot', 'taxi', 'past', 'angle', 'edge', 'j', 'intersection', 'turn', 'circle', 'perceive', 'edge', 'runway', 'say', 'aaib', 'sense', 'run', 'runway', 'light', 'thought', 'centreline', 'turn', 'accordingly', 'face', 'low', 'sun', 'begin', 'takeoff', 'although', 'phenom', 'pilot', 'depart', 'airport', 'previous', 'occasion', 'told', 'aaib', 'familiar', 'small', 'airfield', 'runway', 'width', 'less', 'rather', 'manchester', 'total', 'pave', 'width', 'include', 'widen', 'shoulder', 'either', 'side', 'sidestripe', 'marking', 'pilot', 'indicate', 'aware', 'convex', 'profile', 'manchester', 'runway', 'thought', 'lit', 'centreline', 'front', 'pave', 'surface', 'side', 'seem', 'normal', 'say', 'aaib', 'addition', 'low', 'sun', 'combine', 'wet', 'runway', 'surface', 'far', 'hamper', 'phenom', 'pilot', 'ability', 'accurately', 'perceive', 'position', 'pilot', 'told', 'inquiry', 'believe', 'distract', 'request', 'lineup', 'perform', 'roll', 'takeoff', 'reduce', 'opportunity', 'check', 'position', 'event', 'traffic', 'controller', 'notice', 'mistake', 'confirm', 'via', 'surface', 'movement', 'radar', 'cancel', 'departure', 'clearance', 'twinjet', 'fear', 'runway', 'shoulder', 'low', 'loadbearing', 'strength', 'result', 'debris', 'thrown', 'reject', 'takeoff', 'perform', 'phenom', 'travel', 'around', 'analysis', 'aaib', 'say', 'incident', 'bear', 'strong', 'similarity', 'event', 'march', 'cessna', 'citation', 'line', 'runway', 'via', 'intersection', 'begin', 'takeoff', 'roll', 'track', 'right', 'runway', 'sidestripe', 'although', 'controller', 'coincidentally', 'individual', 'involve', 'dcolt', 'incident', 'attempt', 'alert', 'cessna', 'crew', 'use', 'incorrect', 'callsign', 'meant', 'business', 'jet', 'depart', 'correction', 'make', 'say', 'aaib', 'note', 'light', 'event', 'airport', 'authority', 'implement', 'several', 'safety', 'action', 'assist', 'pilot', 'line', 'intersection', 'include', 'instating', 'runway', 'excursion', 'hotspot', 'intersection', 'reconfiguring', 'leadon', 'light', 'always', 'illuminate', 'stopbar', 'lower', 'apply', 'green', 'paint', 'area', 'turn', 'circle', 'outside', 'runway', 'edge', 'light', 'give', 'impression', 'grass']"
"Investigators have disclosed that a departing Embraer ERJ-145 crew steered the aircraft at 100kt around another jet which had inadvertently entered the runway during the ERJ's take-off roll. The incident occurred at Chicago O'Hare, in darkness but with good visibility, as the Envoy Air ERJ was accelerating along runway 28R. According to the findings from a US National Transportation Safety Board inquiry, released on 14 April, a GoJet Ailrines Bombardier CRJ700 taxiing for 28R missed a left turn onto the parallel taxiway N and instead proceeded to enter the active runway. “It was by sheer luck that there was no collision,” wrote the tower air traffic manager in a subsequent communication to personnel. “The result was a near collision that will likely be measured in feet.” The CRJ700 pilot realised he had entered the runway and immediately turned left, facing the oncoming ERJ, in order to “present the lowest profile”, says the NTSB. “His primary concern was keeping the tail section of his aircraft away from the runway centerline,” the inquiry adds, and he positioned the jet on the northern edge of runway. Although an aural alert from the ASDE-X surface-movement and conflict alert system sounded in the tower, there was insufficient time for controllers to order evasive action. The Envoy Air crew told the inquiry that they had been travelling at about 100kt when they saw the CRJ700 enter the runway, and they steered the ERJ to the left of the centreline in a bid to avert a collision. Investigators state that the ASDE-X system did not have the positional accuracy to determine the minimum separation distance, but the CRJ700 pilot said the ERJ lifted off as it passed by and he estimated the wing-tip clearance at 15-20ft. In an air traffic control factual report the NTSB states that GoJet's policy required at least one pilot to be looking outside the cockpit during taxiing. But interviews with the CRJ700 crew found that the first officer was “head down” with cockpit tasks and co-ordinating with cabin crew, while the captain had looked down to confirm frequency settings, and incorrectly believed – when he looked up again – that the aircraft was passing taxiway B rather than taxiway N. None of those on board either aircraft was injured during the incident, on 17 February 2015. The airport's operator had been in the process of implementing a runway status light system, intended to reduce the risk of incursion, at the time. Coincidentally the Envoy ERJ-145 (N698CB) was itself involved in an incident at Toronto, two years later in April 2017, when it crossed the hold-short line of the active runway 06L as a United Airlines Boeing 737-900ER was accelerating for take-off bound for Chicago O'Hare.

"Boeing has celebrated the 500th delivery of an AH-64E Apache attack helicopter, as it eyes opportunities for additional international sales. Terry Jamison, director of international vertical lift sales for Boeing, says that since AH-64A production commenced in the 1980s there have been 2,485 total deliveries. The type has garnered 16 customers, with 10 countries having “high interest” in potentially obtaining the platform. In 2017, Boeing chartered an Antonov An-124 to transport an AH-64E to Australia's Avalon air show Jamison made the remarks during a 16 April media call timed for Australia's east coast. That reflects Boeing's ambitions to sell the AH-64E to Canberra as it eyes replacement of its Airbus Helicopters Tiger fleet. Citing customer sensitivities, Jamison declines to name the recipient of the 500th AH-64E, but says that altogether, 501 examples have now been delivered. Jamison, a veteran of the US Army, outlines several features that he believes sets the Apache apart. The first is the capability to use its mast-mounted Lockheed Martin/Northrop Grumman Longbow fire-control radar to detect, identify, and attack targets that are not in line of sight. The helicopter can hide behind a hill or other obstacle, pop up to enable its radar to perform a quick scan, and drop back down again. The Apache can detect and classify up to 256 targets, and then offload this data to other units, allowing them to engage the threats. “This is essential when you're going against an integrated defence network on the battlefield,” Jamison says. “Because their defence network can't get line of sight on you, this greatly increases your survivability against that system. Although we've seen it do great things in the counter-insurgency role, it was originally designed to fight high-intensity, sophisticated threats.” Also, he says the helicopter's ability to operate away from big, fixed bases means it is likely to survive the first 48h of a conflict. In addition to Australia, several countries in Southeast Asia have an interest in updating their attack helicopter fleets. There is potential business in Japan and South Korea, and elsewhere in the region, with Bangladesh having expressed interest in the type. Jamison adds that the Apache is well suited to operating in littoral environments. “A lot of people will talk about maritime capability as corrosion prevention only. Yes, that is a key part of it, but there's also the lethality piece.” He points out that the AH-64E's fire-control radar has a built-in capability to detect and classify vessels at sea. Boeing delivered its first E-model Apache to the US Army in 2011, and continues to build new examples and remanufacture earlier AH-64Ds to the new standard for the service. Cirium fleets data records AH-64Es as also being in active service with export users India, Indonesia, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Korea and Taiwan.

"While some capacity has been restored for Mainland China flights, it is likely to remain low for the foreseeable future. In its monthly update, the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) states that “the volume of flights...may continue to to operate at low levels in the future”, as the coronavirus outbreak still holds significant risk levels. After bottoming out in February, when the outbreak hit China badly, Chinese carriers have been steadily adding domestic capacity from March into April and May. These, however, are still lower compared to the same period a year ago. To this end, CAAC spokesperson and director of aviation safety Xiong Jie says the administration will focus first on establishing pandemic risk prevention, “to create a safe operating environment”. For the month of March, airlines in China carried 15.1 million passengers, nearly 72% lower year-on-year. However, freight proved to be a bright spot for the Chinese carriers – the CAAC notes that the total freight volume carried rose about 28% year-on-year for the month, to 253,000 tonnes. The administration also provided updates on the gradual restoration of flights into Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak. When the Wuhan Tianhe International airport reopened on 8 April, 19 Chinese carriers resumed flights to 45 domestic points. The CAAC notes that as of 14 April, more than 40,000 passengers have flown in and out of Wuhan.

"Russia's prosecutor general is to consider the case of an Aeroflot captain indicted over last year's fatal Sukhoi Superjet 100 landing accident at Moscow Sheremetyevo. The federal Investigative Committee says it has completed its criminal probe into the 5 May 2019 accident during which the aircraft returned to the airport after a lightning strike. It bounced on touchdown, resulting in a landing-gear collapse and a fire which engulfed the aft fuselage. Only 37 of the 78 occupants survived the blaze. The Investigative Committee says it has collected “sufficient evidence” in the case and has forwarded the information to the prosecutor general, which will decide on proceeding with the indictment. Examination of the aircraft's flight recorders, it states, found that the Superjet “adequately responded” to the pilot's control inputs. “This information refutes the accused's claim of a possible aircraft malfunction,” it adds.

"The US Air Force's (USAF) new combat search and rescue helicopter, the Sikorsky HH-60W Jolly Green II, completed a month-long battery of extreme conditions testing. The helicopter finished extreme heat, cold, rain and wind testing on 2 April at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida, the service says on 8 April. Within a 5,110sq m test chamber at McKinley Climatic Lab, the helicopter was baked under bright lights which brought the air temperature around the aircraft to 49°C (120°F). It was chilled to -51°C. The aircraft was also blasted with 39kt winds and 130USgal-per-minute of simulated rain, says the USAF. “The crew would execute their preflight checklists and perform tasks to see if the extreme conditions affected any of the avionics, electronics, engine and other systems,” says the USAF. “The aircrew performing the procedures were also test subjects themselves. Their own reactions and movements were evaluated in the harsh environments.” For example, the service evaluated whether pilots could reach all of the aircraft controls while wearing thicker and bulkier cold-weather gear. With testing complete, the HH-60W will return to Sikorsky's test facility in West Palm Beach, Florida for further evaluation, says the USAF. The USAF has ordered 22 examples of the HH-60W so far.

"Airframe maker Spirit AeroSystems expects to post a $160 million net loss in the first quarter of 2020, a reversal from a $163 million profit one year earlier. Preliminary results released by the Wichita company on 14 April reflect a quarter in which Spirit halted much of its production and implemented layoffs and furloughs as it scrambled to respond to the ongoing 737 Max grounding and coronavirus pandemic. The company, which has not released final first quarter financial results, issued preliminary figures the same day it said it will shore its finances with a $1.2 billion debt offering expected to close on 17 April. Spirit intends to use that money for general corporate purposes and to repay other debt, it says.  Spirit makes 737 Max fuselages at its Wichita manufacturing site The company says it generated about $1.1 billion in first quarter revenue, down about 46% from $2.0 billion in the first quarter of 2019. Spirit, which relied on Boeing for about half its 2019 revenue, stopped Boeing-related production on 25 March in response to Boeing's commercial production halt. Boeing halted production due to the coronavirus pandemic. Spirit makes products for a host of Boeing aircraft. The company has also been affected by Airbus' recent reduction in commercial aircraft production rates. Spirit announced on 8 April it will furlough workers in Wichita and Oklahoma for 21 days. In January, the company said it was laying off 2,800 workers due to Boeing's suspension of 737 Max production. That suspension, which led Spirit to suspend its 737 Max fuselage work, resulted not from coronavirus but from delays in certification of the 737 Max. Spirit says its first quarter results will include $205 million in various other expenses. Those include a $42 million one-time expense related to implementing cost- and workforce-reduction efforts, $25 million stemming from the coronavirus-induced production suspension, $73 million from the January 737 Max fuselage production halt and $65 million in retirement plan expenses. The company held $1.8 billion in cash at the end of March, though a Jefferies report notes Spirit intends to close two acquisitions this year – a $420 million purchase of Belgium component provider Asco and a $500 million acquisition of Bombardier's aerostructures plants.",4,321,0.0,0.4225,"order, business, jet, delivery, production, customer, deliver, commercial, quarter, include","['airframe', 'maker', 'spirit', 'aerosystems', 'expect', 'post', 'net', 'loss', 'quarter', 'reversal', 'profit', 'earlier', 'preliminary', 'result', 'release', 'wichita', 'april', 'reflect', 'quarter', 'spirit', 'halt', 'much', 'production', 'implement', 'layoff', 'furlough', 'scramble', 'respond', 'ongoing', 'ground', 'coronavirus', 'pandemic', 'release', 'final', 'quarter', 'financial', 'result', 'issue', 'preliminary', 'figure', 'day', 'say', 'shore', 'finance', 'debt', 'offering', 'expect', 'close', 'april', 'spirit', 'intend', 'use', 'money', 'general', 'corporate', 'purpose', 'repay', 'debt', 'say', 'spirit', 'make', 'fuselage', 'wichita', 'manufacturing', 'site', 'say', 'generate', 'quarter', 'revenue', 'quarter', 'spirit', 'rely', 'half', 'revenue', 'stop', 'boeingrelated', 'production', 'march', 'response', 'commercial', 'production', 'halt', 'halt', 'production', 'due', 'coronavirus', 'pandemic', 'spirit', 'make', 'product', 'host', 'affected', 'recent', 'reduction', 'commercial', 'production', 'rate', 'spirit', 'announce', 'april', 'furlough', 'worker', 'wichita', 'oklahoma', 'day', 'january', 'say', 'lay', 'worker', 'due', 'suspension', 'production', 'suspension', 'lead', 'spirit', 'suspend', 'fuselage', 'work', 'result', 'coronavirus', 'delay', 'certification', 'spirit', 'say', 'quarter', 'result', 'include', 'various', 'expense', 'include', 'onetime', 'expense', 'related', 'implement', 'cost', 'workforcereduction', 'effort', 'stem', 'coronavirusinduced', 'production', 'suspension', 'january', 'fuselage', 'production', 'halt', 'retirement', 'plan', 'expense', 'held', 'cash', 'end', 'march', 'though', 'jefferies', 'report', 'note', 'spirit', 'intend', 'close', 'acquisition', 'purchase', 'belgium', 'component', 'provider', 'asco', 'acquisition', 'bombardier', 'aerostructures', 'plant']"
"Boeing delivered 35% fewer military aircraft year-on-year in the first quarter of 2020. The Chicago-based company delivered 39 aircraft to military service customers in the period, down from 60 in the first quarter of 2019, it says on 14 April. However, the 2020 first quarter total was still more than the company's slowest quarter last year. In the second quarter of 2019, it only delivered 36 aircraft, partly reflecting production problems with its KC-46A Pegasus in-flight refuelling aircraft. In the most-recent quarter, Boeing's production of the AH-64 Apache attack helicopter was down by 12 units in the quarter compared to a year earlier. Production quantities of the company's other aircraft were also all down by a few units. Boeing's production facilities were not impacted by the coronavirus for most of the first quarter of 2020, though it did shut down its Puget Sound facilities in Washington state on 25 March. Those facilities make the KC-46A tanker and the P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft, as well as commercial aircraft, such as 737 Max, 777 and 787. The company announced on 10 April that it was to restart production of the KC-46A and P-8A on 13 April. The Department of Defense (DoD) has given quarantine exemptions to manufacturers of military equipment, citing the continued production of the defence products as essential to the USA's national security. Boeing also suspended work at its Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, facilities for two weeks starting 3 April due to the coronavirus pandemic. At those sites the company makes the CH-47 Chinook cargo helicopter and the Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey tiltrotor. That suspension started in the second quarter. The company's military business unit, Boeing Defense Space & Security, manufactures a mix of military variants of commercial aircraft as well as upgraded Cold War-era aircraft. For example, the P-8A maritime patrol aircraft is based on the the 737-800ERX. The company's legacy F-15 fighter recently was upgraded to the -EX variant. The number of military aircraft Boeing has delivered over the past five quarters has varied widely. That reflects production issues with the KC-46A as well as inconsistent levels of DoD commitment for purchasing some older aircraft. The Pentagon is pushing to modernise its fleet with new types of aircraft. For example, the US Army had planned to stop buying the Block II variant of the CH-47 in fiscal year 2020. The service wants to use the money saved to fund development of new rotorcraft in its Future Vertical Lift initiative, the Future Long Range Assault Aircraft and the Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft. The US Congress and Boeing had pushed back on the idea because it might force the closure of the production line. However, Bruce Jette, assistant secretary of the US Army for acquisition, logistics and technology, said in March that foreign orders of the twin-rotor helicopter should sustain the production line until 2025. It is not clear how production stoppages in Philadelphia and the Puget Sound region will impact Boeing's deliveries in the second quarter. The company's defence facilities in St Louis, Missouri, where it does final assembly of the F-15 and F/A-18E/F, and its facilities in Mesa, Arizona, where it does final assembly of the AH-64 attack helicopter have not been impacted.",4,322,0.0,0.3431,"order, business, jet, delivery, production, customer, deliver, commercial, quarter, include","['deliver', 'military', 'yearonyear', 'quarter', 'chicagobased', 'deliver', 'military', 'service', 'customer', 'period', 'quarter', 'say', 'april', 'however', 'quarter', 'total', 'still', 'slowest', 'quarter', 'second', 'quarter', 'deliver', 'partly', 'reflect', 'production', 'problem', 'pegasus', 'inflight', 'refuel', 'mostrecent', 'quarter', 'production', 'apache', 'attack', 'helicopter', 'unit', 'quarter', 'compare', 'earlier', 'production', 'quantity', 'unit', 'production', 'facility', 'impact', 'coronavirus', 'quarter', 'though', 'shut', 'puget', 'sound', 'facility', 'washington', 'state', 'march', 'facility', 'make', 'tanker', 'poseidon', 'maritime', 'patrol', 'well', 'commercial', 'announce', 'april', 'restart', 'production', 'april', 'department', 'defense', 'dod', 'give', 'quarantine', 'exemption', 'manufacturer', 'military', 'equipment', 'cite', 'continued', 'production', 'defence', 'product', 'essential', 'usa', 'national', 'security', 'suspend', 'work', 'philadelphia', 'pennsylvania', 'facility', 'week', 'start', 'april', 'due', 'coronavirus', 'pandemic', 'site', 'make', 'chinook', 'cargo', 'helicopter', 'bell', 'osprey', 'tiltrotor', 'suspension', 'start', 'second', 'quarter', 'military', 'business', 'unit', 'defense', 'space', 'security', 'manufacture', 'mix', 'military', 'variant', 'commercial', 'well', 'upgraded', 'cold', 'warera', 'example', 'maritime', 'patrol', 'base', 'legacy', 'fighter', 'recently', 'upgraded', 'ex', 'variant', 'number', 'military', 'deliver', 'past', 'quarter', 'varied', 'widely', 'reflect', 'production', 'issue', 'well', 'inconsistent', 'level', 'dod', 'commitment', 'purchasing', 'old', 'pentagon', 'push', 'modernise', 'fleet', 'type', 'example', 'u', 'army', 'plan', 'stop', 'buying', 'block', 'ii', 'variant', 'fiscal', 'service', 'want', 'use', 'money', 'save', 'fund', 'development', 'rotorcraft', 'future', 'vertical', 'lift', 'initiative', 'future', 'long', 'range', 'assault', 'future', 'attack', 'reconnaissance', 'u', 'congress', 'push', 'back', 'idea', 'might', 'force', 'closure', 'production', 'line', 'however', 'bruce', 'jette', 'assistant', 'secretary', 'u', 'army', 'acquisition', 'logistics', 'technology', 'say', 'march', 'foreign', 'order', 'twinrotor', 'helicopter', 'sustain', 'production', 'line', 'clear', 'production', 'stoppage', 'philadelphia', 'puget', 'sound', 'region', 'impact', 'delivery', 'second', 'quarter', 'defence', 'facility', 'st', 'louis', 'missouri', 'final', 'assembly', 'facility', 'mesa', 'arizona', 'final', 'assembly', 'attack', 'helicopter', 'impact']"
"Antonov's outsize An-225 transport has ferried nearly 1,000cb m of supplies from China to the Polish capital Warsaw, the six-engined freighter's first commercial operation since undergoing a modernisation programme. The aircraft was chartered by the UK's Chapman Freeborn, based at London Gatwick, as part of the relief effort to provide medical equipment in response to the coronavirus crisis in Europe. It transported some 100t of medicines, laboratory test items, face-masks and other supplies to Warsaw, arriving on 14 April after a refuelling stop at Almaty, says Antonov. Antonov Airlines lists the An-225's cargo deck as having a capacity of 1,200cb m, meaning that the load approached the aircraft's volumetric limit. “Planning and carrying out charter flights in the current difficult quarantine conditions imposed by many countries – with restrictions on permits for landing and crew rest – requires selfless work from all airline professionals,” says the carrier's first deputy director Vitaly Shost. The aircraft's recent modernisation included installation of new power control equipment, liquid-crystal components for engine systems, and fitting of LED-based lighting. Antonov claims some 80,000 people watched the arrival of the freighter, which performed a low-level pass along Warsaw Chopin airport's runway 33 at about 700ft before entering a circuit and touching down on the same runway about 5min later.",4,323,1.0,0.1532,"test, force, helicopter, fire, system, service, attack, design, usaf, missile","['antonov', 'outsize', 'transport', 'ferry', 'nearly', 'supply', 'polish', 'capital', 'warsaw', 'sixengined', 'freighter', 'commercial', 'operation', 'since', 'undergo', 'modernisation', 'programme', 'charter', 'uk', 'chapman', 'freeborn', 'base', 'london', 'gatwick', 'part', 'relief', 'effort', 'provide', 'medical', 'equipment', 'response', 'coronavirus', 'crisis', 'europe', 'transport', 'medicine', 'laboratory', 'test', 'item', 'facemasks', 'supply', 'warsaw', 'arrive', 'april', 'refuel', 'stop', 'almaty', 'say', 'antonov', 'antonov', 'list', 'cargo', 'deck', 'capacity', 'meaning', 'load', 'approach', 'volumetric', 'limit', 'planning', 'carry', 'charter', 'current', 'difficult', 'quarantine', 'condition', 'impose', 'many', 'country', 'restriction', 'permit', 'land', 'crew', 'rest', 'require', 'selfless', 'work', 'professional', 'say', 'carrier', 'deputy', 'director', 'vitaly', 'shost', 'recent', 'modernisation', 'include', 'installation', 'power', 'control', 'equipment', 'liquidcrystal', 'component', 'engine', 'system', 'fitting', 'ledbased', 'light', 'antonov', 'claim', 'people', 'watch', 'arrival', 'freighter', 'perform', 'lowlevel', 'pas', 'along', 'warsaw', 'chopin', 'airport', 'runway', 'enter', 'circuit', 'touch', 'runway', 'later']"
"British Airways' first Airbus A350-1000 has been damaged in a ground accident which also involved an Emirates Boeing 777-300ER at Dubai. Images circulating on social media indicate that the trailing edge of the A350's left-hand horizontal stabiliser struck – or was struck by – the left-hand elevators of the 777. Circumstances of the event, and the extent of the damage, have yet to be determined. The A350 (G-XWBA) had arrived at Dubai following a service from London Heathrow on 13 April. The 777 (A6-EBR) subsequently arrived on a service from the Saudi Arabian capital Riyadh. Both aircraft appear to have been parked at the western end of the airport. British Airways took delivery of the A350 just nine months ago, in July 2019. The Emirates 777 is an older airframe, originally delivered to the Dubai-based carrier in 2006, according to Cirium fleets data.",4,324,7.0,0.2289,"crew, runway, inquiry, land, approach, accident, investigator, captain, incident, pilot","['british', 'airway', 'damage', 'ground', 'accident', 'involve', 'emirate', 'dubai', 'image', 'circulate', 'social', 'medium', 'indicate', 'trail', 'edge', 'lefthand', 'horizontal', 'stabiliser', 'struck', 'struck', 'lefthand', 'elevator', 'circumstance', 'event', 'extent', 'damage', 'yet', 'determine', 'gxwba', 'arrive', 'dubai', 'follow', 'service', 'london', 'heathrow', 'april', 'subsequently', 'arrive', 'service', 'saudi', 'arabian', 'capital', 'riyadh', 'appear', 'park', 'western', 'end', 'airport', 'british', 'airway', 'take', 'delivery', 'month', 'ago', 'july', 'emirate', 'old', 'airframe', 'originally', 'deliver', 'dubaibased', 'carrier', 'accord', 'fleet', 'data']"
"IATA now forecasts airlines will lose $314 billion in passenger revenue this year amid the coronavirus outbreak, a deepening of $62 billion from its previous projection. The new forecast equates to carriers' 2020 passenger revenue being down 55% on 2019's figure, and reflects worsening economic forecasts and predictions that the return to air travel is likely to be slower than previously expected. The lower revenue in the new forecast is based on a projected 48% fall in traffic measured in RPKs for the full year, IATA states. “We have never seen a downturn this deep before,” says IATA director general Alexandre de Juniac. ”In our latest scenario, full-year passenger revenues plummet 55% compared to 2019, while traffic falls 48%. In other words, half our business disappears. That's catastrophic.” IATA's previous forecast – released on 24 March – predicted a $252 billion, or 44%, hit to passenger revenues and a 38% reduction in RPKs. Most regions will see full-year RPKs down by around 50% year on year, IATA now predicts, with the North American sector being the outlier at around 36%. The Asia-Pacific region accounts for $113 billion of the lost passenger revenue, followed by Europe with $89 billion and North America with $64 billion. The airline body's revision of its 2020 revenue projection was partly prompted by a steeper-than-expected reduction in worldwide flights leading into the second quarter, which IATA expects to be the height of the crisis. It had earlier forecast a fall in flights of around 65% year on year at that point, but by early April flights were down 80%, with the industry being “virtually grounded” aside from domestic markets in the USA and Asia. Among its other revised considerations are a worsening economic outlook, including a projection that global GDP will fall by nearly 6% this year – twice as large as the contraction seen during the global financial crisis. Amid that economic pressure, IATA expects the restart of travel in the second half of 2020 to be slower than previously forecast, driven in part by a slow return to international flights. Domestic markets are forecast to return ahead of international markets, but will still be dampened by poorer-than-expected economic conditions. IATA notes that while domestic markets accounted for 58% of passenger numbers in 2019, international flights accounted for 67% of traffic measured in RPKs – reflecting the latter's importance to airlines. The recession alone would push global RPKs down 8% in the third quarter, IATA notes, before travel restrictions and the confidence effects of the coronavirus outbreak are considered. Even amid a recovery in traffic beginning in the third quarter, global RPKs are still predicted to be down 33% in the fourth quarter of this year. IATA also notes that its revised assessment reflects a much deeper impact on markets in Africa and South America than previously expected. Its forecast continues to be based on severe domestic travel restrictions lasting for the three months that make up 2020's second quarter, with some curbs on international travel extending beyond that period.",4,325,9.0,0.3409,"industry, crisis, demand, coronavirus, global, iata, market, level, cargo, expect","['iata', 'forecast', 'lose', 'passenger', 'revenue', 'amid', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'deepen', 'previous', 'projection', 'forecast', 'equates', 'carrier', 'passenger', 'revenue', 'figure', 'reflect', 'worsen', 'economic', 'forecast', 'prediction', 'return', 'travel', 'likely', 'slow', 'previously', 'expect', 'low', 'revenue', 'forecast', 'base', 'project', 'fall', 'traffic', 'measure', 'rpks', 'full', 'iata', 'state', 'never', 'see', 'downturn', 'deep', 'say', 'iata', 'director', 'general', 'alexandre', 'de', 'juniac', 'late', 'scenario', 'fullyear', 'passenger', 'revenue', 'plummet', 'compare', 'traffic', 'fall', 'word', 'half', 'business', 'disappears', 'iata', 'previous', 'forecast', 'release', 'march', 'predict', 'hit', 'passenger', 'revenue', 'reduction', 'rpks', 'region', 'see', 'fullyear', 'rpks', 'around', 'iata', 'predicts', 'north', 'american', 'sector', 'outlier', 'around', 'asiapacific', 'region', 'account', 'lose', 'passenger', 'revenue', 'follow', 'europe', 'north', 'america', 'body', 'revision', 'revenue', 'projection', 'partly', 'prompt', 'steeperthanexpected', 'reduction', 'worldwide', 'lead', 'second', 'quarter', 'iata', 'expect', 'height', 'crisis', 'earlier', 'forecast', 'fall', 'around', 'point', 'early', 'april', 'industry', 'virtually', 'ground', 'aside', 'domestic', 'market', 'usa', 'asia', 'among', 'revise', 'consideration', 'worsen', 'economic', 'outlook', 'include', 'projection', 'global', 'gdp', 'fall', 'nearly', 'twice', 'large', 'contraction', 'see', 'global', 'financial', 'crisis', 'amid', 'economic', 'pressure', 'iata', 'expect', 'restart', 'travel', 'second', 'half', 'slow', 'previously', 'forecast', 'driven', 'part', 'slow', 'return', 'international', 'domestic', 'market', 'forecast', 'return', 'ahead', 'international', 'market', 'still', 'dampen', 'poorerthanexpected', 'economic', 'condition', 'iata', 'note', 'domestic', 'market', 'account', 'passenger', 'number', 'international', 'account', 'traffic', 'measure', 'rpks', 'reflect', 'latter', 'importance', 'recession', 'alone', 'push', 'global', 'rpks', 'third', 'quarter', 'iata', 'note', 'travel', 'restriction', 'confidence', 'effect', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'consider', 'even', 'amid', 'recovery', 'traffic', 'begin', 'third', 'quarter', 'global', 'rpks', 'still', 'predict', 'fourth', 'quarter', 'iata', 'note', 'revise', 'assessment', 'reflect', 'much', 'deeper', 'impact', 'market', 'africa', 'south', 'america', 'previously', 'expect', 'forecast', 'continue', 'base', 'severe', 'domestic', 'travel', 'restriction', 'month', 'make', 'second', 'quarter', 'curb', 'international', 'travel', 'extend', 'beyond', 'period']"

"Central European budget carrier Wizz Air is cutting 1,000 personnel, nearly one-fifth of its staff, after its operation was reduced to a bare minimum by the coronavirus crisis. The airline says it has been forced to take the “difficult step” to make workers redundant, adding that it has also carried out additional short-term furlough of staff. Wizz Air has a fleet of Airbus jets and is planning to return 32 older aircraft by the end of 2022-23 as their leases expire, as part of its measures to trim costs and improve liquidity. It states that its balance sheet is still “very strong” with “excellent” liquidity including €1.5 billion in cash. Wizz Air has just ended its latest fiscal year, on 31 March 2020, and has disclosed that it will take a fourth-quarter charge of €70-80 million relating to hedging losses. It expects, as a result, to record a net full-year profit of €270-280 million for 2019-20. The airline points out that its underlying net profit will be within its earlier guidance of €350-355 million. But it remains unable to forecast its 2020-21 performance. Chief executive Jozsef Varadi and other senior officers will take a 22% cut in income for the year, while the salaries of pilots, cabin crew and administrative staff will be reduced by an average of 14%. “We have taken various initiatives to protect the position of the company in a controlled manner,” says Varadi, adding that Wizz is reviewing the “competitiveness and allocation” of assets. “We are also working to further improve our strategic, cost and cash position in the aftermath of this crisis to ensure we can deliver our long-term growth target.” The airline is only offering 3% of its pre-crisis capacity.

"Virgin Australia has requested a halt in the trading of its shares while it discusses financing and restructuring options. The airline, which has requested a A$1.4 billion ($900 million) bailout from the federal government, said today it plans to come out of the trading halt on the morning of 16 April or when it issues a statement, whichever comes first. “Virgin Australia requests a trading halt as it continues to consider the issues brought about by the Covid-19 crisis including discussions with respect to financial assistance and restructuring alternatives which are ongoing,” it said in a stock-exchange statement. The carrier has grounded virtually all its operations, leaving only one domestic route and some charter flights in light of travel restrictions that have decimated demand. It has also suspended operations at its TigerAir subsidiary and shuttered its New Zealand crew base in a bid to reduce costs. The Australian government has yet to address directly whether it plans to grant Virgin Australia's loan request. Deputy prime minister Michael McCormack said on 12 April that Australia wants a two-airline industry, but also highlights that the government is already providing A$1 billion worth of support and relief to the industry. Media reports have suggested that Canberra could instead help a new airline enter the market as a rival to Qantas. Qantas has on 25 March moved to shore up its balance sheet by securing a A$1.05 billion loan against seven of its Boeing 787-9s. Virgin Australia however, having posted losses over its last seven financial years, may struggle to find funding as easily as Qantas. Virgin Australia's chief executive Paul Scurrah has previously said that the carrier is also talking to its shareholders about financing, but pointed out that as airline groups, they are experiencing the same cash burn issues from the coronavirus crisis.

"Airports across Asia-Pacific have had to make changes to operations as they grapple with reduced traffic due to the coronavirus outbreak. In Japan, Tokyo Narita International airport has closed one of two runways from 12 April, 06:00 local time, until further notice. “Therefore, in order to ensure operational safety and efficiency at the airport while also striving to prevent further spread of the pandemic, we have decided to close Runway B and move to single-runway operations using Runway A,” the airport operator said in a 10 April statement. It adds that it expects recovery to take “a considerable amount of time”. Australia's Brisbane airport has brought forward the decommissioning of runway 14/32 in order to provide parking space for grounded aircraft. It had planned to decommission the runway in May as part of the preparation process for its new runway. It said in a statement on 7 April that it now plans to provide free parking for up to 100 planes. “We have created an additional 10 dedicated parking zones to accommodate the increased demand, including runway 14/32, Taxiway Papa (the original decommissioned runway for BNE), the logistics apron and various other aprons that have been modified to accommodate additional aircraft,” chief executive Gert-Jan de Graaff said. Perth Airport said in a 10 April post on its official Twitter account that it closed its Terminal 1 domestic pier after Virgin Australia cut its schedule further. Previously, it warned that terminal closures were inevitable. In a statement on 8 April, Perth Airport said it expects to lose up to A$100 million ($63 million) revenue this financial year. Passenger numbers are expected to be close to zero between April and September this year, compared with 5 million in the year-ago period. The operator says fly-in, fly-out (FIFO) workers in resource-rich Western Australia usually account for 20-25% of traffic but they now make up almost all of the airport's passenger numbers. “We are looking at ways we can partially close our terminals during the day or night and look to consolidate flight services around the FIFO demand,” says chief executive Kevin Brown. “Ultimately we will have to temporarily close some terminals due to the almost complete fall-off of interstate and international flights.",4,330,4.0,0.2459,"airport, fleet, service, data, carrier, operation, passenger, number, operate, operator","['airport', 'across', 'asiapacific', 'make', 'change', 'operation', 'grapple', 'reduce', 'traffic', 'due', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'japan', 'tokyo', 'narita', 'international', 'airport', 'close', 'runway', 'april', 'local', 'far', 'notice', 'therefore', 'order', 'ensure', 'operational', 'safety', 'efficiency', 'airport', 'strive', 'prevent', 'far', 'spread', 'pandemic', 'decide', 'close', 'runway', 'b', 'move', 'singlerunway', 'operation', 'use', 'runway', 'airport', 'operator', 'say', 'april', 'statement', 'add', 'expect', 'recovery', 'take', 'considerable', 'amount', 'australia', 'brisbane', 'airport', 'brought', 'forward', 'decommission', 'runway', 'order', 'provide', 'parking', 'space', 'ground', 'plan', 'decommission', 'runway', 'may', 'part', 'preparation', 'process', 'runway', 'say', 'statement', 'april', 'plan', 'provide', 'free', 'parking', 'plane', 'create', 'additional', 'dedicate', 'parking', 'zone', 'accommodate', 'increase', 'demand', 'include', 'runway', 'taxiway', 'papa', 'original', 'decommission', 'runway', 'bne', 'logistics', 'apron', 'various', 'apron', 'modify', 'accommodate', 'additional', 'chief', 'executive', 'gertjan', 'de', 'graaff', 'say', 'perth', 'airport', 'say', 'april', 'post', 'official', 'twitter', 'account', 'close', 'terminal', 'domestic', 'pier', 'virgin', 'australia', 'cut', 'schedule', 'far', 'previously', 'warn', 'terminal', 'closure', 'inevitable', 'statement', 'april', 'perth', 'airport', 'say', 'expect', 'lose', 'revenue', 'financial', 'passenger', 'number', 'expect', 'close', 'zero', 'april', 'september', 'compare', 'yearago', 'period', 'operator', 'say', 'flyin', 'flyout', 'fifo', 'worker', 'resourcerich', 'western', 'australia', 'usually', 'account', 'traffic', 'make', 'almost', 'airport', 'passenger', 'number', 'look', 'way', 'partially', 'close', 'terminal', 'day', 'night', 'look', 'consolidate', 'service', 'around', 'fifo', 'demand', 'say', 'chief', 'executive', 'kevin', 'brown', 'ultimately', 'temporarily', 'close', 'terminal', 'due', 'almost', 'complete', 'falloff', 'interstate', 'international']"
"Wuhan's airport has reopened for operations, ending more than two months' of inactivity due to the coronavirus outbreak. On 8 April , the Wuhan Tianhe International Airport reopened to a reduced schedule of domestic flights, as Chinese carriers gradually resumed flying to the epicentre of the outbreak. It marks the first time scheduled flights are departing and arriving at the airport, which was shut down on 23 January, amid a city-wide lockdown, aimed at curbing the outbreak's spread. China Eastern Airlines operated the first domestic flight out of the airport for the day. Flight MU2527, a Boeing 737-800 carrying 46 passengers, took off at 7.25am, bound for Sanya in Hainan province. The carrier states it is also resuming flights to other points in its domestic network, such as its hub of Shanghai, Xiamen, Ningbo, as well as Guangzhou. It noted that it carried more than 1,600 passengers at the end of 8 April, including 1,100 outbound passengers. In total, it mounted more than 30 flights on the first day of operations. Compatriot China Southern saw its first flight take off bound for Chengdu. Flight CZ3447 was operated by a 737-700 carrying 81 passengers. It operated 48 flights on the first day of operations – the most among the three largest Chinese carriers. Reinstated routes include Guangzhou, Kunming and Haikou. The carrier had already resumed flying to other points in Hubei province, which Wuhan is capital of, before 8 April. Hubei was also placed on lockdown as the outbreak grew in magnitude. Like China Southern, Air China's first flight of the city was also bound for Chengdu, an Airbus 320 operating flight CA8221. Wuhan's local government announced the shutdown of all urban transport network and a suspension of outgoing flights from the morning of 23 January. The city is a major transportation hub and receives 55 international flights each week from over 20 countries, Cirium schedules data shows.

"A captain's decision to continue a flight despite engine trouble caused a Convair C-131B to crash into the Atlantic Ocean in February 2019, according US investigators. The first officer's failure to challenge the captain's decision also contributed to the crash, which killed one person – the captain, says the National Transportation Safety Board's final accident report, released 9 April The accident occurred during a cargo flight on 8 February 2019 from Nassau's Lynden Pindling International airport in the Bahamas to Miami-Opa locka Executive airport. The Convair went down 32nm from Miami on 8 February 2019, killing the captain. The Convair, registration N145GT, was operated by Conquest Air, a company with offices in Miami and Nassau, according to Conquest's website. Conquest could not be reached by phone for comment. The NTSB's report says that during the outbound flight to Nassau that day the first officer was unable to adjust the engine using the “left engine propeller control”. “The power was stuck at 2,400 rpm,” says the report. Twin Pratt & Whitney R-2800CB3 radial engines powered the aircraft. After landing at Nassau, the pilots tried unsuccessfully to notify their maintenance department about the problem via text message. The captain then decided they would try to reset the engine control upon engine restart, and call maintenance if unsuccessful. The pilots were indeed able to reset the control, and they took off normally on the return flight from Nassau to Miami. However, as the aircraft climbed through 4,000ft, the left engine propeller control stopped working and “inadvertently increased power to 2,700 rpm”, says the report. The captain took control from the first officer, levelled the aircraft at 4,500ft and decided to continue the roughly 160nm (296km) flight, nearly all of it over open water, to Miami. “The first officer suggested that they return to the departure airport, but the captain elected to continue,” says the report. “The first officer indicated that he did not want to disagree with the captains' decision given the captain's extensive experience.” When the aircraft started descending, the right engine “began to surge and lose power”, leading the captain to feather that propeller and shut down the right engine. Next, the left engine also surged and lost power. The aircraft lost altitude and crashed into the sea about 32nm east of Opa-locka. “The captain was unresponsive after the impact and the first officer was unable to lift the captain from his seat,” says the report. “Because the cockpit was filling rapidly with water, the first officer grabbed the life raft and exited the airplane from where the tail section had separated from the empennage.” A US Coast Guard helicopter rescued the first officer. The first officer told investigators he did not know why the engines failed. The NTSB's report does not mention the cause of the engine failure, noting the aircraft sunk and was not recovered. The NTSB attributes the accident to “the captain's decision to continue with the flight with a malfunctioning left engine propeller control and the subsequent loss of engine power on both engines for undetermined reasons”. “Contributing to the accident was the first officer's failure to challenge the captain,” it adds. The captain had logged 23,000h of flight time, while the first officer had 650h of experience, says the investigatory board.",4,332,7.0,0.263,"crew, runway, inquiry, land, approach, accident, investigator, captain, incident, pilot","['captain', 'decision', 'continue', 'despite', 'engine', 'trouble', 'cause', 'convair', 'crash', 'atlantic', 'ocean', 'february', 'accord', 'u', 'investigator', 'officer', 'failure', 'challenge', 'captain', 'decision', 'contribute', 'crash', 'kill', 'person', 'captain', 'say', 'national', 'transportation', 'safety', 'board', 'final', 'accident', 'report', 'release', 'april', 'accident', 'occur', 'cargo', 'february', 'nassau', 'lynden', 'pindling', 'international', 'airport', 'bahamas', 'miamiopa', 'locka', 'executive', 'airport', 'convair', 'go', 'miami', 'february', 'kill', 'captain', 'convair', 'registration', 'operate', 'conquest', 'office', 'miami', 'nassau', 'accord', 'conquest', 'website', 'conquest', 'reach', 'phone', 'comment', 'ntsb', 'report', 'say', 'outbound', 'nassau', 'day', 'officer', 'unable', 'adjust', 'engine', 'use', 'left', 'engine', 'propeller', 'control', 'power', 'stuck', 'rpm', 'say', 'report', 'twin', 'pratt', 'whitney', 'radial', 'engine', 'power', 'land', 'nassau', 'pilot', 'try', 'unsuccessfully', 'notify', 'maintenance', 'department', 'problem', 'via', 'text', 'message', 'captain', 'decide', 'try', 'reset', 'engine', 'control', 'upon', 'engine', 'restart', 'call', 'maintenance', 'unsuccessful', 'pilot', 'indeed', 'able', 'reset', 'control', 'take', 'normally', 'return', 'nassau', 'miami', 'however', 'climbed', 'left', 'engine', 'propeller', 'control', 'stop', 'work', 'inadvertently', 'increase', 'power', 'rpm', 'say', 'report', 'captain', 'take', 'control', 'officer', 'level', 'decide', 'continue', 'roughly', 'nearly', 'open', 'water', 'miami', 'officer', 'suggest', 'return', 'departure', 'airport', 'captain', 'elect', 'continue', 'say', 'report', 'officer', 'indicate', 'want', 'disagree', 'captain', 'decision', 'give', 'captain', 'extensive', 'start', 'descend', 'right', 'engine', 'begin', 'surge', 'lose', 'power', 'lead', 'captain', 'feather', 'propeller', 'shut', 'right', 'engine', 'next', 'left', 'engine', 'surge', 'lose', 'power', 'lose', 'altitude', 'crashed', 'sea', 'east', 'opalocka', 'captain', 'unresponsive', 'impact', 'officer', 'unable', 'lift', 'captain', 'seat', 'say', 'report', 'cockpit', 'fill', 'rapidly', 'water', 'officer', 'grabbed', 'life', 'raft', 'exit', 'airplane', 'tail', 'section', 'separate', 'u', 'coast', 'guard', 'helicopter', 'rescue', 'officer', 'officer', 'told', 'investigator', 'know', 'engine', 'fail', 'ntsb', 'report', 'mention', 'cause', 'engine', 'failure', 'note', 'sunk', 'recover', 'ntsb', 'attribute', 'accident', 'captain', 'decision', 'continue', 'malfunction', 'left', 'engine', 'propeller', 'control', 'subsequent', 'loss', 'engine', 'power', 'engine', 'undetermined', 'reason', 'contribute', 'accident', 'officer', 'failure', 'challenge', 'captain', 'add', 'captain', 'log', 'officer', 'experience', 'say', 'investigatory', 'board']"
"European airports lost more passengers in March than in the whole of 2009 when the world was in the midst of a global financial crisis, figures released today by ACI Europe reveal. Passenger numbers across Europe's airports fell by 106 million in March, compared with the same month in 2019. By contrast, “it took Europe's airports 12 months in 2009 to lose 100 million passengers”, states ACI Europe director general Olivier Jankovec. Passenger traffic declined by almost 60% last month and by 21% in the first quarter of 2020. “This is like nothing we have seen before,” adds Jankovec. “With repatriation flights bringing back Europeans to their home countries coming to an end, what now remains is essentially limited to cargo traffic as well as sanitary and other emergency air services.” ACI Europe has altered its projections for the full year downwards, predicting that in a worst-case scenario passenger numbers could decline by as much as 1.2 billion, or 48%, compared with 2019. Its slightly more optimistic assertion is that European airports will lose 873 million passengers this year, representing a 35% decline over the previous year. Before the coronavirus crisis unfolded, passenger numbers had been expected to rise by 2.3% across Europe's airports in 2020. The trade body expects European airport revenues to reduce by between €23 billion ($25 billion) and €29 billion this year. “For now, what airports are getting to help them through is essentially temporary unemployment schemes – although not from all countries. This is, of course, much welcomed as these schemes help airports reduce costs while retaining their workforce,” notes Jankovec. “But airports need them to be prolonged as long as necessary, and they also need urgent flexibility on a range of EU regulatory measures that can help them further reduce their costs.” ACI Europe says it is renewing its call for a “fully co-ordinated European aviation relief plan” to support “all actors in the air transport ecosystem”.",4,333,9.0,0.2827,"industry, crisis, demand, coronavirus, global, iata, market, level, cargo, expect","['european', 'airport', 'lose', 'passenger', 'march', 'whole', 'world', 'midst', 'global', 'financial', 'crisis', 'figure', 'release', 'today', 'aci', 'europe', 'reveal', 'passenger', 'number', 'across', 'europe', 'airport', 'fell', 'march', 'compare', 'month', 'contrast', 'take', 'europe', 'airport', 'month', 'lose', 'passenger', 'state', 'aci', 'europe', 'director', 'general', 'olivier', 'jankovec', 'passenger', 'traffic', 'decline', 'almost', 'month', 'quarter', 'like', 'nothing', 'see', 'add', 'jankovec', 'repatriation', 'bring', 'back', 'european', 'home', 'country', 'come', 'end', 'remains', 'essentially', 'limited', 'cargo', 'traffic', 'well', 'sanitary', 'emergency', 'aci', 'europe', 'alter', 'projection', 'full', 'downwards', 'predict', 'worstcase', 'scenario', 'passenger', 'number', 'decline', 'much', 'compare', 'slightly', 'optimistic', 'assertion', 'european', 'airport', 'lose', 'passenger', 'represent', 'decline', 'previous', 'coronavirus', 'crisis', 'unfolded', 'passenger', 'number', 'expect', 'rise', 'across', 'europe', 'airport', 'trade', 'body', 'expect', 'european', 'airport', 'revenue', 'reduce', 'airport', 'get', 'help', 'essentially', 'temporary', 'unemployment', 'scheme', 'although', 'country', 'course', 'much', 'welcome', 'scheme', 'help', 'airport', 'reduce', 'cost', 'retain', 'workforce', 'note', 'jankovec', 'airport', 'need', 'prolong', 'long', 'necessary', 'need', 'urgent', 'flexibility', 'range', 'eu', 'regulatory', 'measure', 'help', 'far', 'reduce', 'aci', 'europe', 'say', 'renew', 'call', 'fully', 'coordinate', 'european', 'relief', 'plan', 'support', 'actor', 'transport', 'ecosystem']"
"Investigators have determined that both pilots of an EasyJet Airbus A319 mistakenly selected the wrong intersection during take-off performance calculations at Nice, resulting in less runway distance being available than the crew had expected. The crew believed they had calculated take-off performance for runway 04R based on a departure from intersection B3 – the most limiting case. But the UK Air Accidents Investigation Branch found that the crew had inadvertently selected intersection Q3, virtually the whole runway length, for the calculation. The aircraft was ultimately cleared to depart from intersection A3, which should have offered an additional 316m margin of runway compared with a B3 departure. But the Q3 miscalculation actually meant the A3 departure reduced the take-off distance margin by 385m – and would have reduced it by over 700m if the B3 intersection had been used. “At lift-off the [captain] noted that the departure end of the runway was closer than he would have expected but did not perceive any other performance issues,” says the inquiry into the incident, on 29 August last year. It states that reduced thrust had been used for the take-off roll and that, as the situation emerged, the captain did not feel there was a need to increase power. Crucially, the investigation found, both pilots made the same mis-selection of the Q3 rather than the B3 intersection. As a result, it says, the take-off performance cross-check was “invalidated” and the error was undetected. “The flight crew considered that the software user-interface and data presentation was a factor in the intersection selection error being made and subsequently missed,” it adds. Data entry on the electronic flightbag application was “clumsy and often requires re-entering”, according to pilot testimony to the inquiry. For Nice, it says, the B3 and Q3 intersections are easy to mis-select as they are adjacent. The captain involved has since reinforced departure error management briefings to include a review of intersection and performance implications. EasyJet has been working on updating performance software, the inquiry notes, to put greater emphasis on graphic rather than text representation of runway data. Airbus had also been developing enhanced take-off monitoring for A320s and A330s, using a version of take-off surveillance introduced on the A350 the previous year. This function, known as TOS2, checks to confirm the aircraft is travelling on the intended runway and that the performance calculations are compatible with available distance. The aircraft (G-EZBI) involved in the incident, however, was not TOS2-capable.",4,334,7.0,0.3023,"crew, runway, inquiry, land, approach, accident, investigator, captain, incident, pilot","['investigator', 'determine', 'pilot', 'easyjet', 'mistakenly', 'select', 'wrong', 'intersection', 'takeoff', 'performance', 'calculation', 'nice', 'result', 'less', 'runway', 'distance', 'available', 'crew', 'expect', 'crew', 'believe', 'calculate', 'takeoff', 'performance', 'runway', 'base', 'departure', 'intersection', 'limit', 'case', 'uk', 'accident', 'investigation', 'branch', 'found', 'crew', 'inadvertently', 'select', 'intersection', 'virtually', 'whole', 'runway', 'length', 'calculation', 'ultimately', 'clear', 'depart', 'intersection', 'offer', 'additional', 'margin', 'runway', 'compare', 'departure', 'miscalculation', 'actually', 'meant', 'departure', 'reduce', 'takeoff', 'distance', 'margin', 'reduce', 'intersection', 'use', 'liftoff', 'captain', 'note', 'departure', 'end', 'runway', 'closer', 'expect', 'perceive', 'performance', 'issue', 'say', 'inquiry', 'incident', 'august', 'state', 'reduce', 'thrust', 'use', 'takeoff', 'roll', 'situation', 'emerge', 'captain', 'feel', 'need', 'increase', 'power', 'crucially', 'investigation', 'found', 'pilot', 'make', 'misselection', 'rather', 'intersection', 'result', 'say', 'takeoff', 'performance', 'crosscheck', 'invalidate', 'error', 'undetected', 'crew', 'consider', 'software', 'userinterface', 'data', 'presentation', 'factor', 'intersection', 'selection', 'error', 'make', 'subsequently', 'miss', 'add', 'data', 'entry', 'electronic', 'flightbag', 'application', 'clumsy', 'often', 'require', 'reentering', 'accord', 'pilot', 'testimony', 'inquiry', 'nice', 'say', 'intersection', 'easy', 'misselect', 'adjacent', 'captain', 'involve', 'since', 'reinforce', 'departure', 'error', 'management', 'briefing', 'include', 'review', 'intersection', 'performance', 'implication', 'easyjet', 'work', 'update', 'performance', 'software', 'inquiry', 'note', 'put', 'great', 'emphasis', 'graphic', 'rather', 'text', 'representation', 'runway', 'data', 'develop', 'enhance', 'takeoff', 'monitoring', 'use', 'version', 'takeoff', 'surveillance', 'introduce', 'previous', 'function', 'know', 'check', 'confirm', 'travel', 'intend', 'runway', 'performance', 'calculation', 'compatible', 'available', 'distance', 'gezbi', 'involve', 'incident', 'however']"
"Air France-KLM slashed capacity by more than a third in March and will run a “skeleton operation” throughout April and May. The group says traffic at its two mainline carriers dropped 51% year-over-year in March, as it cut capacity 35%. This led to a 21.6 percentage-point reduction in load factor, to 65.4%. Passenger numbers fell 57% to 3.1 million. The biggest capacity cut – 48% – was to Air France-KLM's Asia-Pacific network, followed by its short- and medium-haul network, where available seat-kilometres fell 44%. Capacity cuts at Air France were more pronounced that a tKLM. The French carrier reduced ASKs 37% while its Dutch stablemate cut 32% of its capacity. Air France and KLM say they expect to suspend more than 90% of planned capacity in April and May, but will “continue serving key city-pairs by a skeleton operation from their respective hubs”. Beyond that, the group says it is “unable to provide insight due to the high level of uncertainty over the duration of the [coronavirus] crisis”.

In recent weeks, the airline has slashed seat capacity by 85-90% due to the coronavirus crisis and is “incurring significant revenue losses”, it says. “Once the crisis passes and passenger demand increases, we look forward to returning as many employees as possible to active status as we resume normal operations,” says Air Canada chief executive Calin Rovinescu. In addition to applying for wage subsidies, Air Canada has broadened a company-wide cost-reduction and capital deferment plan. It now expects to save C$750 million this year, up from a previous C$500 million target. Air Canada has also borrowed an additional $1 billion, and Rovinescu and chief financial officer Michael Rousseau have agreed to forgo all their salary. Air Canada has cut other senior executives' salaries 25-50%, and trimmed managers' salaries 10%, it says.",4,338,2.0,0.2309,"executive, chief, cut, add, situation, staff, crisis, make, coronavirus, employee","['canada', 'seek', 'newly', 'available', 'federal', 'wage', 'subsidy', 'domestic', 'employee', 'include', 'roughly', 'worker', 'already', 'lose', 'job', 'montrealbased', 'carrier', 'expand', 'costcutting', 'programme', 'borrow', 'additional', 'fund', 'response', 'coronavirus', 'crisis', 'say', 'april', 'canada', 'apply', 'fund', 'via', 'canada', 'emergency', 'wage', 'subsidy', 'programme', 'make', 'c', 'available', 'see', 'revenue', 'decline', 'least', 'due', 'coronavirus', 'pandemic', 'programme', 'reimburses', 'employee', 'salary', 'maximum', 'c', 'weekly', 'accord', 'government', 'website', 'canada', 'announce', 'job', 'cut', 'march', 'canadian', 'government', 'pass', 'coronavirus', 'relief', 'package', 'april', 'recent', 'week', 'slash', 'seat', 'capacity', 'due', 'coronavirus', 'crisis', 'incur', 'significant', 'revenue', 'loss', 'say', 'crisis', 'pass', 'passenger', 'demand', 'increase', 'look', 'forward', 'return', 'many', 'employee', 'possible', 'active', 'status', 'resume', 'normal', 'operation', 'say', 'canada', 'chief', 'executive', 'calin', 'rovinescu', 'addition', 'apply', 'wage', 'subsidy', 'canada', 'broaden', 'companywide', 'costreduction', 'capital', 'deferment', 'plan', 'expect', 'save', 'c', 'previous', 'c', 'target', 'canada', 'borrow', 'additional', 'rovinescu', 'chief', 'financial', 'officer', 'michael', 'rousseau', 'agree', 'forgo', 'salary', 'canada', 'cut', 'senior', 'executive', 'salary', 'trim', 'manager', 'salary', 'say']"
"British Airways' plan to furlough more than 30,000 employees – a mix of cabin crew and ground staff – has been overwhelmingly ratified by union members. Trade union Unite says members voted 99% in favour of a deal under which the UK airline will introduce a modified version of the government's coronavirus job-retention scheme, which pays 80% of the salary of furloughed workers. Unlike the government scheme, which limits monthly payments to a maximum of £2,500 ($3,060), Unite says there will be no cap on earnings for BA workers. They will be able to divert their pension contributions – about 9-18% of their earnings – into their pay “for a short period of time”. There will be no redundancies, and a redundancy process that had already begun “has been halted”. Members “have recognised the seriousness of the situation facing the aviation sector during this unprecedented crisis, and so have voted to accept the deal negotiated by their union”, states Unite assistant general secretary Howard Beckett. The airline's parent company,IAG, has cut capacity by about 90% for April-May.",4,339,8.0,0.2623,"government, uk, carrier, business, state, share, south, airway, financial, plan","['british', 'airway', 'plan', 'furlough', 'employee', 'mix', 'cabin', 'crew', 'ground', 'staff', 'overwhelmingly', 'ratify', 'union', 'member', 'trade', 'union', 'unite', 'say', 'member', 'vote', 'favour', 'deal', 'uk', 'introduce', 'modify', 'version', 'government', 'coronavirus', 'jobretention', 'scheme', 'pay', 'salary', 'furlough', 'worker', 'unlike', 'government', 'scheme', 'limit', 'monthly', 'payment', 'maximum', 'unite', 'say', 'cap', 'earnings', 'ba', 'worker', 'able', 'divert', 'pension', 'contribution', 'earnings', 'pay', 'short', 'period', 'redundancy', 'redundancy', 'process', 'already', 'begin', 'halt', 'member', 'recognise', 'seriousness', 'situation', 'face', 'sector', 'unprecedented', 'crisis', 'vote', 'accept', 'deal', 'negotiate', 'union', 'state', 'unite', 'assistant', 'general', 'secretary', 'howard', 'beckett', 'parent', 'iag', 'cut', 'capacity', 'aprilmay']"
"EasyJetis standing behind its chief financial officer and its decision to borrow millions from the UK government after a fresh attack from founder and major shareholder Stelios Haji-Iaonnou, who is threatening to take legal action against the budget carrier. The dispute is centred on an order for 107 Airbus aircraft, which Haji-Iaonnou argues should be cancelled or renegotiated in light of the heavy toll the coronavirus pandemic is taking on the aviation industry. After threatening to dismantleEasyJet's board one director at a time – starting with Andreas Bierwirth and moving on to chief financial officer Andrew Findlay – Haji-Iaonnou said on 6 April that he would not inject any fresh capital into the airline while the Airbus contract remained in place. EasyJethas since announced plans to borrow £600 million ($740 million) from the UK government's Covid Corporate Financing Facility (CCFF) – a move Haji-Iaonnou describes as a “misuse of UK taxpayers' money”. In a strongly worded statement published on the London Stock Exchange on 8 April, he writes: “The reason Findlay wants to borrow this £600 million from the UK taxpayer is to pay [Airbus] £2 billion – that is the liability between this year and next year, and before the government loan is due for repayment.” He adds that ifEasyJetsends money to Airbus and fails to repay the UK government in March 2021, he will “personally sue” those involved for breach of their fiduciary duties. Questioning the logic of keeping an aircraft order while much of the airline industry remains grounded, Haji-Iaonnou asks: “When was the last time in the history of aviation that one airline went from having £6 billion in revenues per year to zero revenues inside one month, with no firm date set in the future for returning to carrying fare-paying passengers? Why are these directors ofEasyJetso keen to keep paying Airbus for additional redundant planes?” EasyJethas responded to this latest escalation by saying it “fully supports Andrew Findlay” and “stands by its collective decision to access the CCFF, which was made in the best interests of the company”. The carrier adds: “We remain absolutely focused on removing expenditure from the business, engaging with all of our business partners and suppliers including Airbus, and on safeguarding jobs and short-term liquidity.” Holding a general meeting would,EasyJetargues, “be an unhelpful distraction from tackling the many immediate issues our business faces”. In an 8 April research note, HSBC writes that the money raised through the government facility and the planned drawdown of a $500 million revolving credit facility will strengthenEasyJet's financial position, but the bank expects the dispute with Haji-Iaonnou to rumble on. “We think that recent developments have been constructive for the company's liquidity, de-risking its outlook,” writes HSBC, adding that “the debate with the founder is likely to continue until the shape of the post-virus business is defined and its cash distribution policy is defined”. Haji-Iaonnou has in the past argued thatEasyJetshould adopt a fixed dividend payout amounting to half of post-tax profits, and follow rivalRyanair's approach of buying back shares.",4,340,8.0,0.3636,"government, uk, carrier, business, state, share, south, airway, financial, plan","['easyjetis', 'stand', 'behind', 'chief', 'financial', 'officer', 'decision', 'borrow', 'uk', 'government', 'fresh', 'attack', 'founder', 'major', 'shareholder', 'stelios', 'hajiiaonnou', 'threaten', 'take', 'legal', 'action', 'budget', 'carrier', 'dispute', 'centre', 'order', 'hajiiaonnou', 'argues', 'cancel', 'renegotiate', 'light', 'heavy', 'toll', 'coronavirus', 'pandemic', 'take', 'industry', 'threaten', 'dismantleeasyjet', 'board', 'director', 'start', 'andreas', 'bierwirth', 'move', 'chief', 'financial', 'officer', 'andrew', 'findlay', 'hajiiaonnou', 'say', 'april', 'inject', 'fresh', 'capital', 'contract', 'remain', 'place', 'easyjethas', 'since', 'announce', 'plan', 'borrow', 'uk', 'government', 'covid', 'corporate', 'financing', 'facility', 'ccff', 'move', 'hajiiaonnou', 'describes', 'misuse', 'uk', 'taxpayer', 'money', 'strongly', 'word', 'statement', 'publish', 'london', 'stock', 'exchange', 'april', 'writes', 'reason', 'findlay', 'want', 'borrow', 'uk', 'taxpayer', 'pay', 'liability', 'next', 'government', 'loan', 'due', 'add', 'ifeasyjetsends', 'money', 'fails', 'repay', 'uk', 'government', 'march', 'personally', 'sue', 'involve', 'breach', 'fiduciary', 'duty', 'question', 'logic', 'keep', 'order', 'much', 'industry', 'remains', 'ground', 'hajiiaonnou', 'asks', 'history', 'go', 'revenue', 'per', 'zero', 'revenue', 'inside', 'month', 'firm', 'date', 'set', 'future', 'return', 'carry', 'farepaying', 'passenger', 'director', 'ofeasyjetso', 'keen', 'keep', 'pay', 'additional', 'redundant', 'plane', 'easyjethas', 'respond', 'late', 'escalation', 'say', 'fully', 'support', 'andrew', 'findlay', 'stand', 'collective', 'decision', 'access', 'ccff', 'make', 'best', 'interest', 'carrier', 'add', 'remain', 'absolutely', 'focus', 'remove', 'expenditure', 'business', 'engage', 'business', 'partner', 'supplier', 'include', 'safeguard', 'job', 'shortterm', 'hold', 'general', 'meeting', 'easyjetargues', 'unhelpful', 'distraction', 'tackle', 'many', 'immediate', 'issue', 'business', 'face', 'april', 'research', 'note', 'hsbc', 'writes', 'money', 'raise', 'government', 'facility', 'plan', 'drawdown', 'revolve', 'credit', 'facility', 'strengtheneasyjet', 'financial', 'position', 'bank', 'expect', 'dispute', 'hajiiaonnou', 'rumble', 'think', 'recent', 'development', 'constructive', 'liquidity', 'derisking', 'outlook', 'writes', 'hsbc', 'add', 'debate', 'founder', 'likely', 'continue', 'shape', 'postvirus', 'business', 'define', 'cash', 'distribution', 'policy', 'define', 'hajiiaonnou', 'past', 'argue', 'thateasyjetshould', 'adopt', 'fix', 'dividend', 'payout', 'amount', 'half', 'posttax', 'profit', 'follow', 'rivalryanair', 'approach', 'buying', 'back', 'share']"
"GMF AeroAsia saw its full-year operating profit for 2019 slump, on the back of ballooning expenses. The Garuda Indonesia subsidiary posted an operating profit of $15 million, down 47.1% year-on-year. This was partly attributed to a higher increase in expenses – the MRO saw expenses rise 14.2% to $504 million. Material and subcontracting costs saw larger year-on-year increases. Revenue for the year rose 10.5% to $519 million, led mainly by its repair and overhaul business. Despite posting an operating profit for the year, GMF posted a net loss of $3.19 million, reversing 2018's net profit of $11.1 million. The company did not comment on the matter. GMF ended the year with less cash and cash equivalents – at about $27 million, compared to $39.1 million a year ago. The MRO states the decrease was due to the need to pay factoring liabilities due in 2019. For the year, GMF maintained 430 airframes, most of which were Garuda's. While it was a slight dip from 2018's figures, the MRO notes that it took in more third-party business for the year for its airframe maintenance business. On the engine front, GMF inducted 136 powerplants for the year, 9% higher than 2018. It also saw increase in the volume of work done in its component services business. Line maintenance saw a 5% dip in work done, which GMF attributed to “capacity adjustments made” by airline customers. Along with parent company Garuda Indonesia, GMF has had to restate its 2018 financial results, which saw a significant drop in its operating profit for that year. Garuda was asked by Indonesia's Financial Services Authority (OJK) to restate its 2018 results, following questions raised on non-compliance to accounting standards. The MRO adds in its latest financial results: “[We] did not comply with certain financial covenants as specified in the factoring and bank loans agreements, among others, minimum debt service coverage and current ratios, and ...suffered loss for the year of US$2,988,523.” It has requested for a waiver from its creditors as a result. In its outlook for the year, GMF adds that it was closely monitoring the coronavirus outbreak situation, stating that it “directly affects” its operational activities. To this end, it is hoping to stem revenue loss by “adjusting sensitivity rates based on...flight hours for fixed-price line maintenance” with parent company Garuda. It is also looking to growing its pool of customers to increase its takings. GMF will also request for credit restructuring and relaxation for bank loans in line with OJK's recommendations.",4,341,3.0,0.4572,"passenger, loss, operating, revenue, traffic, month, increase, capacity, decline, result","['gmf', 'aeroasia', 'saw', 'fullyear', 'operating', 'profit', 'slump', 'back', 'ballooning', 'expense', 'garuda', 'indonesia', 'subsidiary', 'post', 'operating', 'profit', 'yearonyear', 'partly', 'attribute', 'high', 'increase', 'expense', 'mro', 'saw', 'expense', 'rise', 'material', 'subcontract', 'cost', 'saw', 'large', 'yearonyear', 'increase', 'revenue', 'rise', 'lead', 'mainly', 'repair', 'overhaul', 'business', 'despite', 'post', 'operating', 'profit', 'gmf', 'post', 'net', 'loss', 'reverse', 'net', 'profit', 'comment', 'matter', 'gmf', 'end', 'less', 'cash', 'cash', 'equivalent', 'compare', 'ago', 'mro', 'state', 'decrease', 'due', 'need', 'pay', 'factor', 'liability', 'due', 'gmf', 'maintain', 'airframe', 'garuda', 'slight', 'dip', 'figure', 'mro', 'note', 'take', 'thirdparty', 'business', 'airframe', 'maintenance', 'business', 'engine', 'front', 'gmf', 'induct', 'powerplants', 'high', 'saw', 'increase', 'volume', 'work', 'component', 'service', 'business', 'line', 'maintenance', 'saw', 'dip', 'work', 'gmf', 'attribute', 'capacity', 'adjustment', 'make', 'customer', 'along', 'parent', 'garuda', 'indonesia', 'gmf', 'restate', 'financial', 'result', 'saw', 'significant', 'drop', 'operating', 'profit', 'garuda', 'ask', 'indonesia', 'financial', 'service', 'authority', 'ojk', 'restate', 'result', 'follow', 'question', 'raise', 'noncompliance', 'accounting', 'standard', 'mro', 'add', 'late', 'financial', 'result', 'comply', 'certain', 'financial', 'covenant', 'specify', 'factor', 'bank', 'loan', 'agreement', 'among', 'others', 'minimum', 'debt', 'service', 'coverage', 'current', 'ratio', 'suffer', 'loss', 'u', 'request', 'waiver', 'creditor', 'result', 'outlook', 'gmf', 'add', 'closely', 'monitoring', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'situation', 'state', 'directly', 'affect', 'operational', 'activity', 'end', 'hop', 'stem', 'revenue', 'loss', 'adjust', 'sensitivity', 'rate', 'base', 'hour', 'fixedprice', 'line', 'maintenance', 'parent', 'garuda', 'look', 'grow', 'pool', 'customer', 'increase', 'taking', 'gmf', 'request', 'credit', 'restructuring', 'relaxation', 'bank', 'loan', 'line', 'ojk', 'recommendation']"
"South Korean carriers are battling the coronavirus pandemic by placing staff on leave and looking to strengthen their balance sheets. Asiana Airlines announced on 7 April it is increasing the limit on its credit lines with the Korea Development Bank and the Export-Import Bank of South Korea by a total of W300 billion ($250 million). Korean Air said on 7 April it will effectively be closed for 6 months, from 16 April to 15 October, to cope with the “deteriorating business environment” and will suspend staff based in South Korea. It adds that it will strengthen the company's balance sheet by selling non-essential assets and will consult its board on plans to raise capital. Korean says only personnel deemed essential for each department will remain at their posts, and over 70% of its workforce will be on leave. Executive staff and vice-presidents will also take pay cuts of between 30% and 50% while the crisis continues. Likewise, Asiana has asked all 10,500 employees to take unpaid leave for 15 days in April, up from 10 days of unpaid leave in March, while executives will take a 60% pay cut, local news agency Maeil Business News Korea reports, citing a statement from the carrier. Budget carrier Eastar Jet is planning to lay off 700 out of some 1,600 employees and is in talks to reduce its fleet by 10 aircraft, according to a 2 April report by Reuters that cites a company spokesperson. Cirium fleets data shows that Eastar Jet, in which Jeju Air is acquiring a majority stake, currently has a fleet of 22 Boeing 737 jets, all in storage. To help its airlines tide over the coronavirus pandemic, the South Korean government has so far suspended airport slot rules and waived or reduced airport charges, landing fees and ATC charges. It has also provided W300 billion in financial support for low-cost carriers. In a 3 April estimate, IATA expects the country's passenger numbers to fall 40% this year, resulting in lost revenue of $8.4 billion. The association said on 26 March that it wrote to the heads of state in 18 Asia-Pacific countries, including South Korea, to appeal for emergency support for the region's airlines. “For airlines, it's apocalypse now,” IATA director general Alexandre de Juniac said in that statement. “And there is a small and shrinking window for governments to provide a lifeline of financial support to prevent a liquidity crisis from shuttering the industry.”",4,342,2.0,0.161,"executive, chief, cut, add, situation, staff, crisis, make, coronavirus, employee","['south', 'korean', 'carrier', 'battling', 'coronavirus', 'pandemic', 'place', 'staff', 'leave', 'look', 'strengthen', 'balance', 'sheet', 'asiana', 'announce', 'april', 'increase', 'limit', 'credit', 'line', 'korea', 'development', 'bank', 'exportimport', 'bank', 'south', 'korea', 'total', 'korean', 'say', 'april', 'effectively', 'close', 'month', 'april', 'october', 'cope', 'deteriorate', 'business', 'environment', 'suspend', 'staff', 'base', 'south', 'korea', 'add', 'strengthen', 'balance', 'sheet', 'sell', 'nonessential', 'asset', 'consult', 'board', 'plan', 'raise', 'capital', 'korean', 'say', 'personnel', 'deem', 'essential', 'department', 'remain', 'post', 'workforce', 'leave', 'executive', 'staff', 'vicepresidents', 'take', 'pay', 'cut', 'crisis', 'continue', 'likewise', 'asiana', 'ask', 'employee', 'take', 'unpaid', 'leave', 'day', 'april', 'day', 'unpaid', 'leave', 'march', 'executive', 'take', 'pay', 'cut', 'local', 'news', 'agency', 'maeil', 'business', 'news', 'korea', 'report', 'cite', 'statement', 'carrier', 'budget', 'carrier', 'eastar', 'jet', 'planning', 'lay', 'employee', 'talk', 'reduce', 'fleet', 'accord', 'april', 'report', 'reuters', 'cite', 'spokesperson', 'fleet', 'data', 'eastar', 'jet', 'jeju', 'acquire', 'majority', 'stake', 'currently', 'fleet', 'jet', 'storage', 'help', 'tide', 'coronavirus', 'pandemic', 'south', 'korean', 'government', 'far', 'suspend', 'airport', 'slot', 'rule', 'waive', 'reduce', 'airport', 'charge', 'land', 'fee', 'atc', 'charge', 'provide', 'financial', 'support', 'lowcost', 'carrier', 'april', 'estimate', 'iata', 'expect', 'country', 'passenger', 'number', 'fall', 'result', 'lose', 'revenue', 'association', 'say', 'march', 'write', 'head', 'state', 'asiapacific', 'country', 'include', 'south', 'korea', 'appeal', 'emergency', 'support', 'region', 'apocalypse', 'iata', 'director', 'general', 'alexandre', 'de', 'juniac', 'say', 'statement', 'small', 'shrink', 'window', 'government', 'provide', 'lifeline', 'financial', 'support', 'prevent', 'liquidity', 'crisis', 'shutter', 'industry']"
"Lufthansa is prematurely phasing out six Airbus A380s as part of fleet cuts across the airline group in preparation for an operational restart with reduced capacity when the coronavirus crisis recedes. Under a previous plan, Lufthansa intended to return six of its 14 A380s to Airbus in 2022 as part of an order for more A350s disclosed in 2019. But now the group says that the aircraft will be “permanently decommissioned” alongside seven A340-600s, five 747-400s and 11Lufthansa-operated A320s because of the coronavirus crisis. The phase-out plan is part of a “first” permanent capacity reduction, the group says. It foresees a “significant decline” in air travel once flights are resumed. Lufthansa says: “It will take months until the global travel restrictions are completely lifted and years until the worldwide demand for air travel returns to pre-crisis levels.” The airline cites “environmental as well as economic disadvantages” for the phase-out of the A340-600s and 747-400s versus other aircraft. Cirium fleets data shows that Lufthansa's fleet includes 20 A340-600s, 17 A340-300s, 13 747-400s and 19 747-8s. All of the A340-600s, 12 A340-300s, nine 747-400s and 14 747-8s are listed as being in storage. Lufthansa's regional CityLine unit, which has operated since 2015 some A340-300s for the mainline on touristic routes, will phase out three of the long-haul jets, the group says. In addition to the 11Lufthansa-operated A320s, low-cost unit Eurowings will decommission another 10 A320s from its fleet and reduce its long-haul operation. Germanwings– another budget unit operating as part of Eurowings's network – will be altogether discontinued ,Lufthansa confirms. Cirium fleets data shows Germanwings has four A319s and five A320s. Lufthansa says that a previous plan to bundle Eurowings' multiple operations into a single unit will be “accelerated”. Meanwhile, restructuring programmes for group subsidiaries Austrian Airlines and Brussels Airlines will be “further intensified”. As part of the efforts, the two carriers are evaluating fleet reductions, Lufthansa notes. Austrian foresees that once regular flights resume, travel demand will be 50-75% lower than during the 2019 summer season. Earlier this month, Austrian extended its operational shutdown until at least 1 May. The Vienna-based carrier says it “anticipates a significant reduction in demand [also] for 2021 and the 'pre-corona level' will probably not be reached until 2023 at the earliest”. Austrian notes it is holding talks with the country's government, Lufthansa and social partners to prepare the company for “a reorientation and adaption...to the changed travel behaviour”. Chief executive Alexis von Hoensbroech states: “The extent to which this will take place has not yet been finally defined and also depends on the further development of the crisis.” Sister carrier Swiss, meanwhile, will “adjust” its fleet size by delaying deliveries of short-haul aircraft and potential early retirement of older aircraft. Lufthansa says it wants to “quickly” begin discussion with unions and staff representatives to “keep as many jobs as possible” within the group. Talks will cover “new employment models...among other things”, the carrier adds.",4,343,4.0,0.3211,"airport, fleet, service, data, carrier, operation, passenger, number, operate, operator","['lufthansa', 'prematurely', 'phase', 'part', 'fleet', 'cut', 'across', 'preparation', 'operational', 'restart', 'reduce', 'capacity', 'coronavirus', 'crisis', 'recedes', 'previous', 'plan', 'lufthansa', 'intend', 'return', 'part', 'order', 'disclose', 'say', 'permanently', 'decommission', 'alongside', 'coronavirus', 'crisis', 'phaseout', 'plan', 'part', 'permanent', 'capacity', 'reduction', 'say', 'foresees', 'significant', 'decline', 'travel', 'resume', 'lufthansa', 'say', 'take', 'month', 'global', 'travel', 'restriction', 'completely', 'lift', 'worldwide', 'demand', 'travel', 'return', 'precrisis', 'cite', 'environmental', 'well', 'economic', 'disadvantage', 'phaseout', 'versus', 'fleet', 'data', 'lufthansa', 'fleet', 'include', 'list', 'storage', 'lufthansa', 'regional', 'cityline', 'unit', 'operate', 'since', 'mainline', 'touristic', 'route', 'phase', 'longhaul', 'jet', 'say', 'addition', 'lowcost', 'unit', 'eurowings', 'decommission', 'another', 'fleet', 'reduce', 'longhaul', 'operation', 'another', 'budget', 'unit', 'operating', 'part', 'eurowings', 'network', 'altogether', 'discontinue', 'lufthansa', 'confirms', 'fleet', 'data', 'germanwings', 'lufthansa', 'say', 'previous', 'plan', 'bundle', 'eurowings', 'multiple', 'operation', 'single', 'unit', 'accelerate', 'meanwhile', 'restructuring', 'programme', 'subsidiary', 'austrian', 'brussels', 'far', 'intensified', 'part', 'effort', 'carrier', 'evaluate', 'fleet', 'reduction', 'lufthansa', 'note', 'austrian', 'foresees', 'regular', 'resume', 'travel', 'demand', 'low', 'summer', 'season', 'earlier', 'month', 'austrian', 'extend', 'operational', 'shutdown', 'least', 'may', 'viennabased', 'carrier', 'say', 'anticipates', 'significant', 'reduction', 'demand', 'level', 'probably', 'reach', 'early', 'austrian', 'note', 'hold', 'talk', 'country', 'government', 'lufthansa', 'social', 'partner', 'prepare', 'reorientation', 'adaption', 'change', 'travel', 'behaviour', 'chief', 'executive', 'alexis', 'von', 'hoensbroech', 'state', 'extent', 'take', 'place', 'yet', 'finally', 'define', 'depends', 'far', 'development', 'sister', 'carrier', 'swiss', 'meanwhile', 'adjust', 'fleet', 'size', 'delay', 'delivery', 'shorthaul', 'potential', 'early', 'retirement', 'old', 'lufthansa', 'say', 'want', 'quickly', 'begin', 'discussion', 'union', 'staff', 'representative', 'keep', 'many', 'job', 'possible', 'within', 'talk', 'cover', 'employment', 'model', 'among', 'thing', 'carrier', 'add']"
"IATA has calculated that some 25 million jobs might be at risk amid falling demand for air travel caused by the coronavirus crisis. According to figures released by the airline association today, “the livelihoods of some 65.5 million people are dependent on the aviation industry, including sectors such as travel and tourism”. Of that total, some 2.7 million people are employed directly by airlines. Based on its current assumption of a 38% drop in RPKs this year alongside a 44% fall in passenger revenues, IATA suggests some 25 million of those 65.5 million jobs “are endangered across the world”. The Asia-Pacific region is most affected, according to IATA's modelling, with 11.2 million jobs under threat, followed by Europe with 5.6 million; Latin America with 2.9 million; North America and Africa, both with 2.0 million; and the Middle East with 900,000. To reduce the crisis' impact on the sector, IATA is calling on governments to provide ”immediate financial aid to help airlines to remain viable businesses able to lead the recovery when the pandemic is contained”. “There are no words to adequately describe the devastating impact of Covid-19 on the airline industry,” says IATA director general Alexandre de Juniac. “And the economic pain will be shared by 25 million people who work in jobs dependent upon airlines. Airlines must be viable businesses so that they can lead the recovery when the pandemic is contained.

"Nigerian investigators have disclosed that a Turkish Airlines Airbus A330-300 suffered damage after travelling partially off the runway for a distance of some 400m following a landing at Port Harcourt. The aircraft (TC-LOL), arriving from Istanbul at night on 30 December last year, had been established on the localiser for runway 21 and was stable during its approach. Its crew had flown the aircraft manually from about 400ft, says the Nigerian Accident Investigation Bureau. The captain, who was flying, had 694h on type. Preliminary findings show the aircraft landed to the right of the centreline, touching down about 612m from the threshold and almost immediately travelling over the edge with its right-hand main landing-gear. It returned to the runway around 400m further on, and reached the centreline after another 440m.

"Up to €1.1 billion in European air navigation charge payments is being deferred under an agreement intended to assist airlines struggling under the impact of the coronavirus outbreak. Pan-European air navigation organisation Eurocontrol says its members have agreed the deferral as part of a financial package to provide “liquidity support”. Eurocontrol data for 43 associated countries in the region shows that traffic had fallen by more than 90% in 33 of them by 5 April, compared with the previous year. “Many airlines contacted Eurocontrol to confirm that they would not be in a position to facilitate their next payments,” says director general Eamonn Brennan. “This payment deferral will ease the immediate burden on airlines and it provides certainty on financial planning to both airlines and the air navigation service providers on when payments will be made after the crisis has abated.” Eurocontrol calculates route charges for air navigation by combining a distance factor with an aircraft weight factor and a country-specific unit rate. The unit rate has a wide variation – regions such as Switzerland, the Benelux states and the UK charge higher rates than Hungary, Cyprus and the Baltic countries. As of January this year the calculation of the weight factor has been revised, to be based on the certificated maximum take-off weight of the aircraft performing the flight, rather than the average certificated MTOW of all aircraft of the same ICAO type. Eurocontrol had previously been estimating route charges for 2020 would total €8.2 billion, based on a 3.4% rise in traffic service units to 173 million.",4,346,3.0,0.1364,"passenger, loss, operating, revenue, traffic, month, increase, capacity, decline, result","['european', 'navigation', 'charge', 'payment', 'defer', 'agreement', 'intend', 'assist', 'struggle', 'impact', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'paneuropean', 'navigation', 'organisation', 'eurocontrol', 'say', 'member', 'agree', 'deferral', 'part', 'financial', 'package', 'provide', 'liquidity', 'support', 'eurocontrol', 'data', 'associate', 'country', 'region', 'traffic', 'fall', 'april', 'compare', 'previous', 'many', 'contact', 'eurocontrol', 'confirm', 'position', 'facilitate', 'next', 'payment', 'say', 'director', 'general', 'eamonn', 'brennan', 'payment', 'deferral', 'ease', 'immediate', 'burden', 'provide', 'certainty', 'financial', 'planning', 'navigation', 'service', 'provider', 'payment', 'make', 'crisis', 'eurocontrol', 'calculates', 'route', 'charge', 'navigation', 'combine', 'distance', 'factor', 'weight', 'factor', 'countryspecific', 'unit', 'rate', 'unit', 'rate', 'wide', 'variation', 'region', 'switzerland', 'benelux', 'state', 'uk', 'charge', 'high', 'rate', 'hungary', 'cyprus', 'baltic', 'country', 'january', 'calculation', 'weight', 'factor', 'revise', 'base', 'certificate', 'maximum', 'takeoff', 'weight', 'perform', 'rather', 'average', 'certificate', 'mtow', 'icao', 'type', 'eurocontrol', 'previously', 'estimate', 'route', 'charge', 'total', 'base', 'rise', 'traffic', 'service', 'unit']"
"New Zealand will enter into reciprocal transit arrangements with a number of countries to make it easier for both citizens and foreigners to get home. The rapid closure of borders and tightening travel restrictions, along with the resulting decline in commercial airline flights has left many travellers struggling to get home. Primeminister Jacinda Ardern said at a press briefing today: “A major barrier to New Zealanders getting back here at the moment is transit restrictions imposed by many countries. We in turn are seeing an increasing number of requests from foreign governments to allow their nationals to transit through Auckland.” Air New Zealand, which has slashed 95% of its schedule and is operating almost entirely as a domestic and cargo airline, said it would study the new arrangements. Chief revenue officer Cam Wallance posted on Twitter today: “Currently looking at the changes to the transit regulations and what impact it will have on [Air New Zealand's Asia and America] services.” New Zealand's airports were closed to transiting passengers, except for Australian nationals, on 25 March.

"Etihad Airways will trial new contactless technology that will help it identify passengers with medical conditions, potentially even those with early stages of the coronavirus. The carrier is partnering with Australian technology firm Elenium Automation to test the new concept later this month at its Abu Dhabi hub. The technology can “monitor the temperature, heart rate and respiratory rate of any person using an airport touchpoint”, which includes at check-in, immigration, or bag-drop. Etihad is partnering Elenium Automation to test a contactless health screening kiosk. Should a passenger show signs of illness, the system will automatically suspend check-in or bag-drop. “It will then divert to a teleconference or alert qualified staff on site, who can make further assessments and manage travellers as appropriate,” Etihad adds. However, the carrier is cautious to call it a tool for medical diagnoses. Etihad vice president for hub and midfield operations Jorg Oppermann says: “This technology is...an early warning indicator which will help to identify people with general symptoms, so that they can be further assessed by medical experts, potentially preventing the spread of some conditions to others preparing to board flights to multiple destinations.” Elenium has also developed hands-free technologies that use voice recognition to perform certain self-service tasks. This, it states, will minimise the potential of viral or bacterial transmission. The technology firm's chief executive Aaron Hornlimann says: “The system would screen every individual, including multiple people on the same booking. The technology can also be retrofitted into any airport kiosk or bag drop or installed as a desktop system at a passenger processing point such as an immigration desk.”",4,348,1.0,0.2088,"test, force, helicopter, fire, system, service, attack, design, usaf, missile","['etihad', 'airway', 'trial', 'contactless', 'technology', 'help', 'identify', 'passenger', 'medical', 'condition', 'potentially', 'even', 'early', 'stage', 'coronavirus', 'carrier', 'partner', 'australian', 'technology', 'firm', 'elenium', 'automation', 'test', 'concept', 'later', 'month', 'abu', 'dhabi', 'hub', 'technology', 'monitor', 'temperature', 'heart', 'rate', 'respiratory', 'rate', 'person', 'use', 'airport', 'touchpoint', 'include', 'checkin', 'immigration', 'bagdrop', 'etihad', 'partner', 'elenium', 'automation', 'test', 'contactless', 'health', 'screen', 'kiosk', 'passenger', 'sign', 'illness', 'system', 'automatically', 'suspend', 'checkin', 'bagdrop', 'divert', 'teleconference', 'alert', 'qualify', 'staff', 'site', 'make', 'far', 'assessment', 'manage', 'traveller', 'appropriate', 'etihad', 'add', 'however', 'carrier', 'cautious', 'call', 'tool', 'medical', 'diagnosis', 'etihad', 'vice', 'president', 'hub', 'midfield', 'operation', 'jorg', 'oppermann', 'say', 'technology', 'early', 'warn', 'indicator', 'help', 'identify', 'people', 'general', 'symptom', 'far', 'assess', 'medical', 'expert', 'potentially', 'prevent', 'spread', 'condition', 'others', 'prepare', 'board', 'multiple', 'elenium', 'developed', 'handsfree', 'technology', 'use', 'voice', 'recognition', 'perform', 'certain', 'selfservice', 'task', 'state', 'minimise', 'potential', 'viral', 'bacterial', 'transmission', 'technology', 'firm', 'chief', 'executive', 'aaron', 'hornlimann', 'say', 'system', 'screen', 'every', 'individual', 'include', 'multiple', 'people', 'book', 'technology', 'retrofit', 'airport', 'kiosk', 'bag', 'drop', 'instal', 'desktop', 'system', 'passenger', 'processing', 'point', 'immigration', 'desk']"
"Air Deccan, a small regional airline that was once India's largest low-cost carrier, has become the first airline in the country to fall victim to the coronavirus pandemic. Cirium fleets data shows the airline has just two 19-seater Beechcraft 1900Ds but once boasted Airbus narrowbodies and ATR turboprops. It announced on Sunday it is ceasing operations until further notice, according to local media reports. Air Deccan could not be reached for comment and its website was not functioning at the time of publication. The airline was founded by GR Gopinath, dubbed in one television interview as “the man who got India's middle class to fly”. The airline got off to an ill-fated start in 2003, having to abandon its inaugural flight carrying Indian dignitaries due to an engine fire during taxi. Despite that, it managed to grow its fleet and route network, and in 2008 completed a merger with now-defunct Kingfisher Airlines. Under its new owner, Air Deccan was rechristened Kingfisher Red, but its high operating costs and low yields proved to be a drag on Kingfisher. In 2011 Kingfisher, which not long after went belly up, decided to phase out Kingfisher Red. Gopinath managed to retain the name Air Deccan by registering for it soon after the rebranding, Forbes India reports. Air Deccan made a comeback in December 2017 when it was granted a flying permit from India's civil aviation regulator to conduct flights under the country's regional connectivity scheme called UDAN, according to local media reports at the time. The first three routes were from Mumbai to Nashik, Pune and Jalgaon, according to Forbes India. Cirium fleets data shows that the airline owns both of its aircraft.

"The aerospace industry downturn and broader economic fallout caused by coronavirus has led aircraft systems supplier Woodward and aerospace composite company Hexcel to terminate a planned merger. The companies say the decision comes “in response to the increasing impact on both the aerospace and industrial sectors, and global markets broadly, resulting from the health crisis caused by the coronavirus”, according to a joint 6 April statement. “The pandemic has resulted in a need for each company to focus on its respective businesses and has impacted the companies' ability to realise the benefits of the merger”. Fort Collins, Colorado-based Woodward, which had $2.9 billion in 2019 revenue, makes aerospace fuel pumps, nozzles, valves, thrust reverse actuation systems and flight deck controls. Its components are found on Airbus A320neo-family aircraft, Boeing 737 Max, 787s, Gulfstream G650 business jets, helicopters and fighter jets, according to company documents. Hexcel, based in Stamford, Connecticut, makes composite products for aircraft made by a range of manufacturers, including Airbus, Boeing, Bombardier and Embraer. Commercial aerospace sales accounted for 68% of Hexcel's $2.6 billion in 2019 revenue, securities filings show. In January, Hexcel and Woodward announced their intention to merge in the third quarter of 2020. In one 6 April research report, Financial services company Canaccord Genuity called news of the deal's termination “not entirely surprising” considering the “dire outlook for Boeing production and deliveries”, Boeing's decision to extend a temporary shutdown of its Washington state production facilities and the collapse of air travel demand. Boeing on 5 April said it was extending “until further notice” what had been a two-week Washington state shutdown. “Both the supply and demand shocks to the commercial aircraft market have created much more distraction now, and require a focus on near-term cost actions and execution, as opposed to white-knuckling a merger on the scale of Woodward-Hexcel,” says Canaccord's report. The substantial decline in the price of Hexcel's stock in recent weeks makes that company an “attractive target” for a takeover, Canaccord adds. Hexcel's stock price has sunk 61% since the beginning of 2020, to roughly $31 per share on 6 April.",4,350,0.0,0.3089,"order, business, jet, delivery, production, customer, deliver, commercial, quarter, include","['industry', 'downturn', 'broader', 'economic', 'fallout', 'cause', 'coronavirus', 'lead', 'system', 'supplier', 'woodward', 'composite', 'hexcel', 'terminate', 'plan', 'merger', 'say', 'decision', 'come', 'response', 'increase', 'impact', 'industrial', 'sector', 'global', 'market', 'broadly', 'result', 'health', 'crisis', 'cause', 'coronavirus', 'accord', 'joint', 'april', 'statement', 'pandemic', 'result', 'need', 'focus', 'respective', 'business', 'impact', 'ability', 'realise', 'benefit', 'merger', 'fort', 'collins', 'coloradobased', 'woodward', 'revenue', 'make', 'fuel', 'pump', 'nozzle', 'valve', 'thrust', 'reverse', 'actuation', 'system', 'deck', 'control', 'component', 'found', 'gulfstream', 'business', 'jet', 'helicopter', 'fighter', 'jet', 'accord', 'document', 'hexcel', 'base', 'stamford', 'connecticut', 'make', 'composite', 'product', 'make', 'range', 'manufacturer', 'include', 'bombardier', 'embraer', 'commercial', 'sale', 'account', 'hexcel', 'revenue', 'security', 'filing', 'january', 'hexcel', 'woodward', 'announce', 'intention', 'merge', 'third', 'quarter', 'april', 'research', 'report', 'financial', 'service', 'canaccord', 'genuity', 'call', 'news', 'deal', 'termination', 'entirely', 'surprising', 'consider', 'dire', 'outlook', 'production', 'delivery', 'decision', 'extend', 'temporary', 'shutdown', 'washington', 'state', 'production', 'facility', 'collapse', 'travel', 'demand', 'april', 'say', 'extend', 'far', 'notice', 'twoweek', 'washington', 'state', 'shutdown', 'supply', 'demand', 'shock', 'commercial', 'market', 'create', 'much', 'distraction', 'require', 'focus', 'nearterm', 'cost', 'action', 'execution', 'oppose', 'whiteknuckling', 'merger', 'scale', 'woodwardhexcel', 'say', 'canaccord', 'report', 'substantial', 'decline', 'price', 'hexcel', 'stock', 'recent', 'week', 'make', 'attractive', 'target', 'takeover', 'canaccord', 'add', 'hexcel', 'stock', 'price', 'sunk', 'since', 'begin', 'roughly', 'per', 'share', 'april']"
"The coronavirus outbreak pummelled business aircraft activity in March across Asia, Europe and North America, according to German research company WingX Advance, with the decline set to continue throughout April as travel restrictions strangle demand for charter, corporate and private flying. Asia recorded the steepest decline in business aircraft traffic, from 7,600 departures across the region's airports in March 2019 to just under 5,000 last month – a fall of over 35%. China was worst hit, with traffic dropping by over two thirds year-on-year to 300 flights, while Singapore, a close second, recorded a 60% fall in traffic to 150 departures of instrument flight rules-operated business jets, turboprops and piston-engined aircraft. Gulfstream G650 Departures from European airports fell by over a third, from 53,400 in March 2019 to 35,500 last month. “The decline accelerated towards the end of March, with the last few days seeing close to 50% reductions,” says WingX. Italy recorded the largest slide, with just over 1,000 departures in March, marking a decline of more than 70% year on year. Activity in France, “normally the busiest European market”, was down by 43% to 5,400 business aircraft departures across its airports. Germany and Switzerland each saw declines of over 30%, to 4,900 and 2,700 flights, respectively, while departures from UK airports fell by nearly a quarter year-on-year, to 5,800. Sweden was the only country in Europe to buck the downward trend, WingX reveals, recording a 1.3% increase in departures, to 1,500. WingX's data shows the greatest decline in traffic was for long-range business jets, with the sector recording a fall in flights of over 40%. Activity by managed aircraft plunged by 50% year-on-year, and fractional ownership flights by 40%, while branded charter and corporate flights slid by 20%. By contrast, air ambulance and emergency support traffic more than doubled in volume, from 1,000 flights in March 2019 to 2,200 last month. Activity in North America fell by nearly a quarter during the same period, to 214,000 flights, with the USA, the world's largest business aviation market, the hardest hit. Flights from the country's airports dropped by 30% year-on-year to 193,500, says WingX, with the decline “gathering momentum” in the second of half of the month. “Activity levels on 31 March were down by two thirds compared with the same date in 2019”, it notes. “The abruptness of the decline in business aviation activity in March is only comparable to the effect of the EyjafjallajÃ¶kull volcano eruption [in Iceland] back in 2010, only with much longer and more severe consequences,” says WingX founder and chief executive Richard Koe. WingX expects a “trough” in flight activity in April, “which may see some countries completely shut down flights”, says Koe. “With an optimistic outlook for ending virus containment, we might see renewed demand for flights by the summer, at which point business aviation may have a window of opportunity to meet pent-up demand whilst the airline capacity is still parked,” he adds.",4,351,3.0,0.3437,"passenger, loss, operating, revenue, traffic, month, increase, capacity, decline, result","['coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'pummel', 'business', 'activity', 'march', 'across', 'asia', 'europe', 'north', 'america', 'accord', 'german', 'research', 'wingx', 'advance', 'decline', 'set', 'continue', 'throughout', 'april', 'travel', 'restriction', 'strangle', 'demand', 'charter', 'corporate', 'private', 'fly', 'asia', 'record', 'steepest', 'decline', 'business', 'traffic', 'departure', 'across', 'region', 'airport', 'march', 'month', 'fall', 'bad', 'hit', 'traffic', 'drop', 'third', 'yearonyear', 'singapore', 'close', 'second', 'record', 'fall', 'traffic', 'departure', 'instrument', 'rulesoperated', 'business', 'jet', 'turboprop', 'pistonengined', 'gulfstream', 'departure', 'european', 'airport', 'fell', 'third', 'march', 'month', 'decline', 'accelerate', 'towards', 'end', 'march', 'day', 'see', 'close', 'reduction', 'say', 'wingx', 'italy', 'record', 'large', 'slide', 'departure', 'march', 'mark', 'decline', 'activity', 'france', 'normally', 'busiest', 'european', 'market', 'business', 'departure', 'across', 'airport', 'germany', 'switzerland', 'saw', 'decline', 'respectively', 'departure', 'uk', 'airport', 'fell', 'nearly', 'quarter', 'yearonyear', 'sweden', 'country', 'europe', 'buck', 'downward', 'trend', 'wingx', 'reveals', 'record', 'increase', 'departure', 'wingx', 'data', 'great', 'decline', 'traffic', 'longrange', 'business', 'jet', 'sector', 'record', 'fall', 'activity', 'manage', 'plunge', 'yearonyear', 'fractional', 'ownership', 'brand', 'charter', 'corporate', 'slid', 'contrast', 'ambulance', 'emergency', 'support', 'traffic', 'double', 'volume', 'march', 'month', 'activity', 'north', 'america', 'fell', 'nearly', 'quarter', 'period', 'usa', 'world', 'large', 'business', 'market', 'hardest', 'hit', 'country', 'airport', 'drop', 'yearonyear', 'say', 'wingx', 'decline', 'gathering', 'momentum', 'second', 'half', 'month', 'activity', 'level', 'march', 'third', 'compare', 'date', 'note', 'abruptness', 'decline', 'business', 'activity', 'march', 'comparable', 'effect', 'volcano', 'eruption', 'iceland', 'back', 'much', 'longer', 'severe', 'consequence', 'say', 'wingx', 'founder', 'chief', 'executive', 'richard', 'koe', 'wingx', 'expect', 'trough', 'activity', 'april', 'may', 'see', 'country', 'completely', 'shut', 'say', 'koe', 'optimistic', 'outlook', 'end', 'virus', 'containment', 'might', 'see', 'renew', 'demand', 'summer', 'point', 'business', 'may', 'window', 'opportunity', 'meet', 'pentup', 'demand', 'whilst', 'capacity', 'still', 'park', 'add']"
"Investigators have found incorrectly-sized components on the landing-gear assembly of an Icelandair Boeing 757-200 which suffered a main landing-gear collapse at Reykjavik earlier this year. Icelandic investigation authority RNSA has recommended specific safety checks on four aircraft serviced by Landing Gear Technologies, to ensure that parts which have undergone undersizing work still mate properly. Examination of the 757 showed that the side strut of the landing gear had detached from the shock strut. The two are connected by a swivel. RNSA says threads in the swivel twice underwent undersizing, during maintenance work in 2008 and 2019. This reduction in the diameter of the swivel threads was permitted but required a special undersized nut to be manufactured. Investigators' initial measurements, however, showed the nut from the landing-gear was “too large” for the undersized swivel threads, says RNSA. Investigators found the main gear side strut detached from the shock strut Flight FI529, operated by the 20-year old TF-FIA, had been arriving from Berlin on 7 February. Cockpit-voice recordings show the crew was “not aware of any problems” before the landing, and flight-data recorder information revealed no abnormal loading during touchdown. The flare was normal and the jet initially touched down on its right, then left, main landing-gear. But as the nose was de-rotating an “abnormal sound” was heard and the jet listed to the right, its right-hand engine striking the runway before the nose-gear made contact. Investigators found that the swivel nut and an associated washer were missing from the immediate scene, and were located near the aircraft's touchdown point. A locking bolt for the nut was also found to have sheared. Full analysis work on the swivel and nut has been delayed by US travel restrictions imposed as a result of the coronavirus outbreak, but RNSA has made interim safety recommendations to Icelandair and its associate operator Cabo Verde Airlines regarding landing-gear checks. Landing Gear Technologies has yet to comment on RNSA's preliminary findings.",4,352,6.0,0.3208,"engine, maintenance, fuel, takeoff, result, failure, system, problem, power, issue","['investigator', 'found', 'incorrectlysized', 'component', 'landinggear', 'assembly', 'icelandair', 'suffer', 'main', 'landinggear', 'collapse', 'reykjavik', 'earlier', 'icelandic', 'investigation', 'authority', 'rnsa', 'recommend', 'specific', 'safety', 'check', 'service', 'land', 'gear', 'technology', 'ensure', 'part', 'undergone', 'undersizing', 'work', 'still', 'mate', 'properly', 'examination', 'side', 'strut', 'land', 'gear', 'detach', 'shock', 'strut', 'connect', 'swivel', 'rnsa', 'say', 'thread', 'swivel', 'twice', 'underwent', 'undersizing', 'maintenance', 'work', 'reduction', 'diameter', 'swivel', 'thread', 'permit', 'require', 'special', 'undersized', 'nut', 'manufacture', 'investigator', 'initial', 'measurement', 'however', 'nut', 'landinggear', 'large', 'undersized', 'swivel', 'thread', 'say', 'rnsa', 'investigator', 'found', 'main', 'gear', 'side', 'strut', 'detach', 'shock', 'strut', 'operate', 'old', 'tffia', 'arrive', 'berlin', 'february', 'cockpitvoice', 'recording', 'crew', 'aware', 'problem', 'land', 'flightdata', 'recorder', 'information', 'reveal', 'abnormal', 'load', 'touchdown', 'flare', 'normal', 'jet', 'initially', 'touch', 'right', 'left', 'main', 'landinggear', 'nose', 'derotating', 'abnormal', 'sound', 'heard', 'jet', 'list', 'right', 'righthand', 'engine', 'strike', 'runway', 'nosegear', 'make', 'contact', 'investigator', 'found', 'swivel', 'nut', 'associate', 'washer', 'miss', 'immediate', 'scene', 'locate', 'near', 'touchdown', 'point', 'lock', 'bolt', 'nut', 'found', 'shear', 'full', 'analysis', 'work', 'swivel', 'nut', 'delayed', 'u', 'travel', 'restriction', 'impose', 'result', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'rnsa', 'make', 'interim', 'safety', 'recommendation', 'icelandair', 'associate', 'operator', 'cabo', 'verde', 'regard', 'landinggear', 'check', 'land', 'gear', 'technology', 'yet', 'comment', 'rnsa', 'preliminary', 'finding']"
"EasyJet founder and shareholder Stelios Haji-Iaonnou has refused to inject any fresh capital into the UK budget airline while a contract to acquire further Airbus jets remains in place, and is turning his wrath on chief financial officer Andrew Findlay. Haji-Ioannou has named Findlay as the second director he aims to remove from his position, while he persists with efforts to oust Andreas Bierwirth. EasyJet chairman John Barton has, according to Haji-Ioannou, delayed an “inevitable” shareholder meeting over Bierwirth's position for technical reasons but this appears simply to have inflamed Haji-Ioannou's ire. The power struggle has erupted as EasyJet – like many airlines – faces financial pressure arising from the grounding of its fleet over the coronavirus crisis. Haji-Ioannou claims an outstanding order for 107 Airbus aircraft should be cancelled or renegotiated as it represents a heavy and unnecessary capital expenditure commitment. The airline's share price has fallen by close to 70% since mid-February. “Terminating the Airbus contract is the only chance current shareholders have to maintain any value in their shares,” insists Haji-Ioannou. He argues that, if the contract is cancelled, EasyJet will not need UK government loans and its “best chance to survive and thrive” will come from shareholder equity injections.

"Icelandair Group has recruited advisors to look into options for reinforcing its capital structure, and explore possibilities for strengthening its competitiveness. It states that its liquidity position is still “well above” its minimum level of $200 million. But it adds that – given the assumption of “minimum revenue generation” in April and May – liquidity is likely to fall below this level. “The company intends to assess options to strengthen its financial position further for the long term in the upcoming weeks,” it says. Icelandair Group has hired Kvika Banki, Islandsbanki and Landsbankinn as advisors to initiate the process of shoring up its capital. It will also co-ordinate with the Icelandic government. “This will ensure that Icelandair Group will get through these difficult times as smoothly as possible and minimise disruption to the Icelandic tourism industry and economy,” it says. Icelandair Group adds that the steps will help it to strengthen its position, in order to “react quickly” when opportunities arise again. The company says it has been keeping key transatlantic routes open for passenger and cargo transport, but its schedule is down to less than 10% of its original plans for the time of year.

"Vietnam Airlines will restrict passenger loads on services to Ho Chi Minh City's Tan Son Nhat International Airport so as not to stress the airport's mandatory coronavirus testing. Its Boeing 787s and Airbus A350-900s will be restricted to 180 passengers, says the carrier. Cirium fleets data shows that the airline's five in-service 787-9s have an average seat count of 281, its three 787-10s have an average of 367, and its three A350-900's have 305 seats each. In addition, its 15 in-service A321s – 13 A321s and two A321neos - will be restricted to carrying 120 passengers, though average capacity is 192 seats. “The purpose of these requirements is to ensure that the number of passengers arriving at Tan Son Nhat Airport is within the COVID-19 testing capacity of Ho Chi Minh City,” says the airline. “Currently, COVID-19 testing now applies to all passengers arriving at Tan Son Nhat Airport's domestic terminal. Should the number of passengers entering Ho Chi Minh City through Tan Son Nhat Airport increase, authorities may decide to quarantine them first before conducting COVID-19 screening tests.” Cirium estimates that the airline has 31 aircraft in service and 78 in storage. On 19 March, the airline suspended all international flights owing to entry restrictions and border closures.",4,357,4.0,0.3706,"airport, fleet, service, data, carrier, operation, passenger, number, operate, operator","['vietnam', 'restrict', 'passenger', 'load', 'service', 'ho', 'chi', 'minh', 'city', 'tan', 'son', 'nhat', 'international', 'airport', 'stress', 'airport', 'mandatory', 'coronavirus', 'test', 'restrict', 'passenger', 'say', 'carrier', 'fleet', 'data', 'inservice', 'average', 'seat', 'count', 'average', 'seat', 'addition', 'inservice', 'restrict', 'carry', 'passenger', 'though', 'average', 'capacity', 'seat', 'purpose', 'requirement', 'ensure', 'number', 'passenger', 'arrive', 'tan', 'son', 'nhat', 'airport', 'within', 'coronavirus', 'test', 'capacity', 'ho', 'chi', 'minh', 'city', 'say', 'currently', 'coronavirus', 'test', 'applies', 'passenger', 'arrive', 'tan', 'son', 'nhat', 'airport', 'domestic', 'terminal', 'number', 'passenger', 'enter', 'ho', 'chi', 'minh', 'city', 'tan', 'son', 'nhat', 'airport', 'increase', 'authority', 'may', 'decide', 'quarantine', 'conduct', 'coronavirus', 'screen', 'estimate', 'service', 'storage', 'march', 'suspend', 'international', 'owe', 'entry', 'restriction', 'border', 'closure']"

"Secondary airports across the United States have objected to the Department of Transportation's (DOT) show cause order which would require carriers who plan to take government relief as a result of the coronavirus pandemic maintain minimum service to certain points across the country. But the airports which have commented so far have divergent, even opposite motives for their objections, bringing into focus how diverse the interests are served by the $2 trillion CARES act, passed by Congress and signed by President Donald Trump into law on 27 March. The bill sets aside almost $60 billion in loans and grants to US airlines and related businesses. A show cause order, published by the Department of Transportation (DOT) on 31 March requires airlines that accept government support to maintain a skeleton air transport network, including service to cities already served, even though passenger demand has plummeted due to the coronavirus. That means that some airports within a geographical area will continue to be connected, whereas others will not. “In cases where multiple airports serve the same point, carriers would not need to maintain service to all such airports, but would be able to consolidate operations at a single airport serving the point,” the show cause order from 31 March says. This has caused many regional airports to analyse what it means for them. In Northeastern Ohio, for example, Akron-Canton Regional Airport (CAK) has objected to the order because it is afraid to be overlooked because of its proximity to Cleveland Hopkins International Airport (CLE), 55 miles away. It claims its business interests and regional impact are too important to be ignored and being excluded could cause long-term loss for the region. The show cause order “is a material detriment to the maintenance of important air passenger service provided by CAK at a level consistent with reasonable air carrier accommodation,” the airport says on 3 April. “Further it is CAK's firm conviction that the negative consequences to CAK and the public it serves, will likely extend well beyond the serious, but temporal, disruptions to air passenger service caused by the pandemic.” United Airlines, Delta Airlines, Spirit Airlines and American Airlines all connect Akron to various hubs across the country including Chicago O'Hare, Newark, Orlando and Atlanta. The airport says it served about 480,000 passengers in 2019. The likely result of grouping Akron and Cleveland into one “point” will be that airlines will consolidate operations at the larger Cleveland airport in order to combine costs “potentially damaging the short and long term viability of CAK – an important aviation infrastructure asset and economic impact driver whose success and market importance was established over years of progress”, the airport adds. In Virginia, the city of Williamsburg says its Newport News-Williamsburg International airport (PHF) and its clientele and associated businesses would suffer if it is looked over in favour of Norfolk International airport, 30 miles to the south. “We strongly believe even a temporary loss of air service at PHF would have a negative, long-term impact on our business and regional economy – exactly what the Department and Federal government are trying to alleviate in the intent of the CARES Act and this proposal,” city manager Andrew Trivette wrote in a letter to the DOT. Other US airports have the opposite problem. They had entered agreements with carriers in order to subsidise routes and guarantee minimum revenues to enter and grow the markets, costs which they can now no longer sustain. Southwest Wyoming Sweetwater Regional airport (RKS) in Rock Springs, Wyoming, for example, had entered a capacity purchase agreement with SkyWest so that passengers could connect to Denver International airport, a major United hub, without having to travel several hours on the ground. “There should be a published exemption for air carriers to be able reduce service...should the contracting entity (in this case) the State of Wyoming request it,” the airport says in its comment from 2 April. “Due to the lack of demand, the Southwest Wyoming Regional airport and it's supporting entities that pay for the air service would like to reduce the service to less than 5 days per week, but the request has been denied because it would risk the carriers' eligibility for stimulus monies.” In California, Stockton Metropolitan airport (SCK) has similar concerns. “We have an economic development contract with SkyWest that is now unsustainable due to the massive passenger reductions suffered under the COVID-19 pandemic,” Russel Stark, the airports director writes. “SCK guaranteed SkyWest minimum revenues to enter and grow our air market, but none of our models projected zero passenger revenue, which is what we are seeing now. The subsidy required under these conditions is well above our budget.” Skywest, which has since released Stockton from the commitment, the airport adds, had operated two daily flights each to and from Los Angeles International airport as United Express, according to Cirium networks data.

"London Heathrow is to switch to single-runway operations from 6 April, following a substantial fall in the traffic demand at the UK capital hub. The airport has two parallel runways – designated 09L/27R and 09R/27L – which will alternate on a weekly basis, to mitigate noise impact. Heathrow's operator states that the simplified operation, a temporary measure while the coronavirus crisis persists, is intended to “increase resilience and safety for colleagues, passengers and cargo”. Eurocontrol data indicates that activity at Heathrow has fallen by more than 85% compared with last year. British Airways is the primary operator at the airport. The airport normally alternates its runway use, swapping the departure and arrival runways about halfway through the day, at 15:00, when operations are towards the west. Both runways can be used for arrivals at peak time. Operations towards the east are more restrictive, as a pact known as the Cranford Agreement prevented use of 09L for departures during the day. While this agreement has ended, alternation for easterly operations is not expected until at least 2023-24 owing to changes relating to Heathrow's third runway development.

"Europe's safety regulator is advising commercial aircraft operators to adopt new procedures to switch off air-conditioning system recirculation fans regularly, as part of measures to limit the risk of coronavirus contagion. Supplementary procedures to turn off the fans periodically would “accelerate cabin air exchange”, says the European Union Aviation Safety Agency. Its advisory is part of a series of operational recommendations to operators of passenger and cargo aircraft in response to the coronavirus outbreak. Carriers should provide a sufficient supply of surgical-standard face-masks for the intended operation, and these should be worn at all times by crew members having direct contact with passengers or non-crew individuals – and be replaced every 4h. Hand disinfectants should be provided in lavatories on board, with crews informed that frequent hand-washing is the “preferred and most efficient” preventative measure to limit transmission, says EASA, although it acknowledges that this might be restricted by water-tank capacity – in which case single-use gloves should be employed. Airlines should consider spacing passengers throughout the cabin – avoiding centre seats in triple-seat blocks – as far as weight-and-balance conditions permit, or encourage use of passenger face-masks. They should also collaborate with health authorities by encouraging crews to identify passengers showing signs of respiratory infection, collecting passenger data if necessary – particularly from those in the same cabin section – and supporting passenger-tracing and epidemiological investigation measures if the presence of coronavirus on a flight is confirmed. “Aircraft operators, irrespective of area of aircraft operation, should limit the access to the flightcrew compartment of crew members other than flightcrew to the minimum necessary, subject to the operator's procedures,” adds EASA. “Other personnel, including ground handling and medical personnel, if not necessary for the completion of their task, should not board the aircraft and should make use of electronic documents wherever possible.”",4,361,6.0,0.1837,"engine, maintenance, fuel, takeoff, result, failure, system, problem, power, issue","['europe', 'safety', 'regulator', 'advise', 'commercial', 'operator', 'adopt', 'procedure', 'switch', 'airconditioning', 'system', 'recirculation', 'fan', 'regularly', 'part', 'measure', 'limit', 'risk', 'coronavirus', 'contagion', 'supplementary', 'procedure', 'turn', 'fan', 'periodically', 'accelerate', 'cabin', 'exchange', 'say', 'european', 'union', 'safety', 'agency', 'advisory', 'part', 'series', 'operational', 'recommendation', 'operator', 'passenger', 'cargo', 'response', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'carrier', 'provide', 'sufficient', 'supply', 'surgicalstandard', 'facemasks', 'intend', 'operation', 'worn', 'crew', 'member', 'direct', 'contact', 'passenger', 'noncrew', 'individual', 'replace', 'every', 'hand', 'disinfectant', 'provide', 'lavatory', 'board', 'crew', 'inform', 'frequent', 'handwash', 'prefer', 'efficient', 'preventative', 'measure', 'limit', 'transmission', 'say', 'easa', 'although', 'acknowledges', 'might', 'restrict', 'watertank', 'capacity', 'case', 'singleuse', 'glove', 'employ', 'consider', 'space', 'passenger', 'throughout', 'cabin', 'avoid', 'centre', 'seat', 'tripleseat', 'block', 'far', 'weightandbalance', 'condition', 'permit', 'encourage', 'use', 'passenger', 'facemasks', 'collaborate', 'health', 'authority', 'encourage', 'crew', 'identify', 'passenger', 'sign', 'respiratory', 'infection', 'collect', 'passenger', 'data', 'necessary', 'particularly', 'cabin', 'section', 'support', 'passengertracing', 'epidemiological', 'investigation', 'measure', 'presence', 'coronavirus', 'confirm', 'operator', 'irrespective', 'area', 'operation', 'limit', 'access', 'flightcrew', 'compartment', 'crew', 'member', 'flightcrew', 'minimum', 'necessary', 'subject', 'operator', 'procedure', 'add', 'easa', 'personnel', 'include', 'ground', 'handle', 'medical', 'personnel', 'necessary', 'completion', 'task', 'board', 'make', 'use', 'electronic', 'document', 'wherever', 'possible']"

The latest update indicates the carrier will fly three times a week to eight regional destinations, namely Tokyo Narita, Taipei, New Delhi, Bangkok, Jakarta, Manila, Ho Chi Minh City and Singapore. Subsidiary Cathay Dragon will operate three flights a week to Beijing, Shanghai Pudong and Kuala Lumpur. “We will continue to monitor these flights closely and may make further reductions if necessary,” the carrier states. In a recent memo to staff, cited by various media outlets, Cathay said demand had collapsed to the point where it carried just 582 passengers one day, compared to its usual daily traffic of 100,000.",4,362,5.0,0.3491,"carrier, march, international, outbreak, suspend, capacity, schedule, april, united, coronavirus","['cathay', 'pacific', 'announce', 'far', 'cut', 'longhaul', 'schedule', 'april', 'plan', 'passenger', 'capacity', 'scrap', 'carrier', 'already', 'announce', 'march', 'reduce', 'capacity', 'april', 'may', 'part', 'term', 'bare', 'skeleton', 'schedule', 'operate', 'twiceweekly', 'service', 'london', 'heathrow', 'los', 'angeles', 'vancouver', 'sydney', 'say', 'april', 'travel', 'advisory', 'previously', 'intend', 'fly', 'destination', 'week', 'part', 'reduce', 'schedule', 'late', 'update', 'indicates', 'carrier', 'fly', 'week', 'regional', 'destination', 'namely', 'tokyo', 'narita', 'taipei', 'delhi', 'bangkok', 'jakarta', 'manila', 'ho', 'chi', 'minh', 'city', 'singapore', 'subsidiary', 'cathay', 'dragon', 'operate', 'week', 'beijing', 'shanghai', 'pudong', 'kuala', 'lumpur', 'continue', 'monitor', 'closely', 'may', 'make', 'far', 'reduction', 'necessary', 'carrier', 'state', 'recent', 'memo', 'staff', 'cite', 'various', 'medium', 'outlet', 'cathay', 'say', 'demand', 'collapse', 'point', 'carry', 'passenger', 'day', 'compare', 'usual', 'daily', 'traffic']"
"Collapsing domestic travel in Mainland China – the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak – coupled with falling travel demand to and from the Asia-Pacific region, led to the sharpest drop in demand in almost two decades. Releasing its global passenger traffic data for February, IATA says RPKs for the month fell 14.1% year-on-year, making it the steepest decline in traffic since the September 11 attacks in 2001. Capacity, measured in ASKs, declined 8.7% year-on-year, and overall load factor fell 4.8 percentage points to 75.9%. International passenger demand fell 10.1% year-on-year, reversing the 2.6% increase recorded in January. IATA adds that this is the worst showing since the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak of 2003. IATA's international passenger traffic data ASKs dipped 5%, which led to a load factor decline of 4.2 percentage points to 75.3%. Domestic passenger demand performed worst – RPKs for the month dropped 20.9% year-on-year, led mainly by the collapse of domestic travel in Mainland China. February was the month multiple lockdowns and travel restrictions within the country were put up. Overall domestic ASKs fell 15.1%, and load factor dropped 5.6 percentage points to 77%. By region, Asia-Pacific carriers bore the brunt of collapsing demand: RPKs fell 41%, while ASKs saw a decline of nearly 17%, with load factors plunging 13.2 percentage points year-on-year to 67.9%. The corresponding fallout from the outbreak caused traffic declines in two markets – North America and Africa. North American carriers saw a 2.8% traffic decline for the month, reversing the 2.9% increase recorded in January. This was due mainly to entry restrictions, as well as falling volumes on Asia-North America routes. ASKs fell 1.5%, while load factor slipped 1 percentage point to 77.7%. For African carriers, the traffic decline of 1.1% for the month “was driven by around a 35% year-on-year traffic fall in the Africa-Asia market”, says IATA. February's data was the worst for the continent's carriers since 2015, and reverses a 5.6% traffic increase recorded in January. Latin American carriers too, saw traffic drop – at 0.4% year-on-year – though IATA notes this was an improvement from January figures, where traffic fell 3.5%. “However, the spread of the virus and resulting travel restrictions will be reflected in March results,” the association adds. Capacity fell 0.4%, while load factor was flat at 81.3%. Only European and Middle Eastern carriers saw modest increases in passenger traffic for February, although they too, felt the impact of falling travel demand from Asia. European carriers saw demand remain about the same compared to last year, increasing just 0.2%. It was, however, the region's worst showing in a decade, IATA notes. “The slowdown was driven by routes to/from Asia, where the growth rate slowed by 25 percentage points in February, versus January,” it adds. ASKs rose 0.7%, while load factors fell 0.4 percentage points to 82%. Middle Eastern carriers saw RPKs increase 1.6% for the month, a slowdown from the 5.3% growth in January. ASKs went up by 1.3%, while load factor inched up 0.2 percentage points to 72.6%. Calling the outbreak a “sledgehammer” which hit airlines hard in February, IATA chief executive and director-general Alexandre de Juniac says the outbreak's impact on aviation “has left airlines with little to do except cut costs and take emergency measures in an attempt to survive in these extraordinary circumstances”. He doubled down on calls for more governments to help their airlines through “the biggest crisis that the industry has ever faced”. “This is aviation's darkest hour and it is difficult to see a sunrise ahead unless governments do more to support the industry through this unprecedented global crisis.

"Air freight rates are rising and cargo carriers ramping up their utilisation to fill the gap left by grounded bellyhold capacity on passenger jets. Normally, nearly half of global air cargo is carried in passenger jets' bellies. Total cargo capacity, adjusted to include the Lunar New Year, fell 4.4% in February, according to IATA, even before shutdowns were enacted outside Asia, wreaking havoc with passenger schedules in March. Air cargo demand also fell in February, notes IATA, by 9.1% globally and 15.5% in Asia-Pacific. “The disruption of global supply chains led to a fall in demand,” IATA states, “but the dramatic disruption in passenger traffic resulted in even deeper cuts to cargo capacity. And the industry is struggling to serve remaining demand with the limited capacity available. We only got a first glimpse of this in February.” This shake-up of the industry has led to booming price rates for air freight as capacity is squeezed. “We have never been as busy as we are now,” Larry Coyne, chief executive of cargo specialist Coyne Airways, tells Cirium. “We would rather not have Covid-19, but for our business this has been a real uplift.” Coyne Airways does not own or operate its own aircraft, but purchases space on passenger and cargo flights. With much of the capacity removed from the market, prices have leapt to many times their previous levels. Whereas freight rates for transatlantic cargoes were previously at around $0.80 per kilogramme, they have now risen to $2.50-4 per kilogramme, enticing several passenger airlines to begin operating cargo-only flights. Air Canada, Aeromexico, American Airlines, Austrian, British Airways, Cathay Pacific, Delta, Emirates, Iberia, Korean, LATAM, Lufthansa, Qantas, Scoot, Swiss and United, among many other carriers, have made passenger aircraft in their fleets available for chartered cargo operations, notes IATA. Coyne explains that “a calculation that needs to be done”: at a rough estimate, a New York to London flight at the normal market rate of $0.80 per kilogramme would earn a passenger airline operating a Boeing 777 around $20,000, but with rates now at up to $4 per kilogramme they could earn $100,000. The incentive to deploy passenger aircraft in the freight market may be blunted as cargo airlines bring back into service aircraft that had previously been stored. This process will be helped by collapsing oil prices, which make fuel-guzzling older jets more economical to fly. IATA noted recently that freight carriers were also delaying the retirement of aircraft. In Coyne's words, “the enemy of passenger planes [carrying cargo loads] is cargo operators bringing back capacity”. So far, most existing customer demand has held up in the face of higher prices, he notes. Coyne Airways arranges capacity for energy projects in the Caspian region, which have large enough budgets to absorb the increase. For consumer products and food, demand is more elastic. “There is a difference between freight that has to go and that likes to go,” Coyne observes.",4,367,9.0,0.3371,"industry, crisis, demand, coronavirus, global, iata, market, level, cargo, expect","['freight', 'rate', 'rise', 'cargo', 'carrier', 'ramp', 'utilisation', 'fill', 'gap', 'left', 'ground', 'bellyhold', 'capacity', 'passenger', 'jet', 'normally', 'nearly', 'half', 'global', 'cargo', 'carry', 'passenger', 'jet', 'belly', 'total', 'cargo', 'capacity', 'adjust', 'include', 'lunar', 'fell', 'february', 'accord', 'iata', 'even', 'shutdown', 'enact', 'outside', 'asia', 'wreak', 'havoc', 'passenger', 'schedule', 'march', 'cargo', 'demand', 'fell', 'february', 'note', 'iata', 'globally', 'asiapacific', 'disruption', 'global', 'supply', 'chain', 'lead', 'fall', 'demand', 'iata', 'state', 'dramatic', 'disruption', 'passenger', 'traffic', 'result', 'even', 'deeper', 'cut', 'cargo', 'capacity', 'industry', 'struggle', 'serve', 'remain', 'demand', 'limited', 'capacity', 'available', 'get', 'glimpse', 'shakeup', 'industry', 'lead', 'boom', 'price', 'rate', 'freight', 'capacity', 'squeeze', 'never', 'busy', 'larry', 'coyne', 'chief', 'executive', 'cargo', 'specialist', 'coyne', 'airway', 'tell', 'rather', 'coronavirus', 'business', 'real', 'coyne', 'airway', 'operate', 'purchase', 'space', 'passenger', 'cargo', 'much', 'capacity', 'remove', 'market', 'price', 'leapt', 'many', 'previous', 'level', 'whereas', 'freight', 'rate', 'transatlantic', 'cargo', 'previously', 'around', 'per', 'kilogramme', 'risen', 'per', 'kilogramme', 'entice', 'several', 'passenger', 'begin', 'operating', 'cargoonly', 'canada', 'aeromexico', 'american', 'austrian', 'british', 'airway', 'cathay', 'pacific', 'delta', 'emirate', 'iberia', 'korean', 'latam', 'lufthansa', 'qantas', 'scoot', 'swiss', 'united', 'among', 'many', 'carrier', 'make', 'passenger', 'fleet', 'available', 'charter', 'cargo', 'operation', 'note', 'iata', 'coyne', 'explains', 'calculation', 'need', 'rough', 'estimate', 'york', 'london', 'normal', 'market', 'rate', 'per', 'kilogramme', 'earn', 'passenger', 'operating', 'around', 'rate', 'per', 'kilogramme', 'earn', 'incentive', 'deploy', 'passenger', 'freight', 'market', 'may', 'blunt', 'cargo', 'bring', 'back', 'service', 'previously', 'store', 'process', 'help', 'collapse', 'oil', 'price', 'make', 'fuelguzzling', 'old', 'jet', 'economical', 'fly', 'iata', 'note', 'recently', 'freight', 'carrier', 'delay', 'retirement', 'coyne', 'word', 'enemy', 'passenger', 'plane', 'carry', 'cargo', 'load', 'cargo', 'operator', 'bring', 'back', 'capacity', 'far', 'exist', 'customer', 'demand', 'held', 'face', 'high', 'price', 'note', 'coyne', 'airway', 'arranges', 'capacity', 'energy', 'project', 'caspian', 'region', 'large', 'enough', 'budget', 'absorb', 'increase', 'consumer', 'product', 'food', 'demand', 'elastic', 'difference', 'freight', 'go', 'like', 'go', 'coyne', 'observes']"
"American Airlines says its summer 2020 schedule will reflect the realities of the decline in demand after the global coronavirus pandemic. International capacity will be significantly less than it was in the same period in 2019, and several route introductions will be delayed, the airline says on 2 April.  American cuts summer schedule “American will suspend more than 60% of its total international capacity this summer compared to the same peak period in 2019, which includes an 80% reduction in Pacific capacity, 65% reduction in Atlantic capacity and 48% reduction in Latin America capacity. These changes are due to significantly decreased customer demand as well as government travel restrictions – both related to the coronavirus pandemic,” the airline says. Previously announced new service to from the US to Auckland, Bangalore and Christchurch, scheduled to begin in 2020, will be delayed until winter 2021. Start dates for other routes to Asia and Europe will also be pushed back into later in the year or next year. The Fort Worth-based carrier adds that 25 summer seasonal flights will be delayed until 2021. According to the schedule, published on American's website, numerous routes to Europe and Asia which were temporarily suspended earlier this year will resume on 4 June or 7 July.

"US discount airlines Allegiant Air, Frontier Airlines and Sun Country Airlines have raised objections to a US Department of Transportation (DOT) requirement that airlines maintain minimal services if they accept government aid. Last week, the US government passed a roughly $2 trillion aid package known as the CARES Act that sets aside almost $60 billion in loans and grants to US airlines and related businesses. But the money comes with conditions that could create financial difficulties for ultra-low-cost carriers (ULCCs) that operate varying networks and already-infrequent schedules, those carries say. A 31 March DOT order requires airlines that accept government support to maintain a skeleton air transport network, including service to cities already served, even though passenger demand has plumetted due to the coronavirus pandemic. The order bases the service requirements on schedules prior to 1 March 2020. Now US discount airlines are pushing back, citing the uniqueness of their networks. The National Air Carrier Association (NACA), which represents ULCCs Allegiant, Frontier, Spirit Airlines, and Sun Country, says on 1 April the order ”unjustly discriminates against, and penalises, air carriers that provide seasonal air services”. The arbitrary date of 1 March, says NACA, is not viable for low-cost carriers, which cater mainly to vacationers escaping the colder northern winter weather for warmer destinations in the southern US and Caribbean. The industry group proposes “a more equitable approach to ensure fairness and equity to all air carriers”, basing the requirements on April and May 2020 schedules, rather than February schedules. In its objection to the DOT order, Indigo Partners-owned Frontier says maintaining its routes as mandated, with no or very few passengers aboard, will quickly eat into its reserves, and go against what the government relief package originally intended “The imposition of minimum service standards as proposed would be fundamentally inconsistent with the policy and objectives of the CARES Act,” Frontier writes on 2 April. “It ignores the seasonal nature of Frontier's and other ULCCs' schedules and the efforts of federal, state, and local governments to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic by banning all but essential travel and ordering people to shelter in place or stay at home.” By using the week of 29 February as a benchmark, the airline says the government ignored the “rapidly changing, unprecedented and precipitous drop in passenger traffic” that resulted from travel restrictions and lockdown orders in many jurisdictions, as well as the fact that its winter schedule looks very different from its summer schedule. The DOT's service obligations extend through September 2020. Competitor Allegiant says that while it intends to maintain a robust schedule, the airline ”must retain the right to cancel, with reasonable notice to customers, flights that have insufficient bookings even to cover the variable cost of operations – specifically, those costs above and beyond payroll, which is theoretically covered by a CARES Act grant for the next two months.” The ULCCs contend that imposing a one-size-fits-all policy for all airlines will put them an undue disadvantage compared to mainline carriers. ULCCs generally operate with lower margins and serve a different audience base. “Such a service pattern is very different from the traditional daily or more frequent, year-round, and highly predictable service patterns operated by larger major airlines, with many destinations aimed at business travellers,” Frontier argues. Frontier serves different cities during winter, meaning its network at the end of February is different than during the middle of the year. Maintaining that winter schedule into April, May and beyond would be detrimental to its business, the airline says. Frontier gives a concrete example of how the order's effects would counter the law's original intentions. The airline's published flight schedule for April had what it calls a “substantial service reduction” of 193 weekly departures serving 33 airports. In order to comply with the DOT's requirements, Frontier would have to add 460 weekly departures, a 240% increase. Most of those flights would have unsustainably low load factors, forcing it to unnecessarily burn cash for a business that already has exceedingly low margins. In addition, Frontier says it is unreasonable to demand connectivity to and from cities and states which have imposed stay at home orders in an attempt to prevent the spread of the virus. “Operating air service with a crew and perhaps few or no passengers into a state or city under such an order undermines the very objectives those orders seek to accomplish to limit significantly people's movements and interactions,” the airline says. Allegiant adds, ”The order, were it finalised without substantial change, would allow Allegiant neither the seasonality nor the frequency flexibility required for it to serve its network without squandering much of the financial assistance it will receive under the CARES Act – a result that would be contrary to the public interest.” Vacation specialist Sun Country says the order would fundamentally change its business model. “Sun Country... provides service to middle- and lower-middle-class Americans, many from rural, working-class communities, who otherwise would not be able to afford air travel,” the airline writes on 1 April. ”The proposed order requiring airlines to continue a schedule developed for peak winter travel into the spring disadvantages Sun Country relative to other airlines and forces Sun Country to fly flights now that in prior years, it never would have operated, and for which, there is no demand.” ",4,369,4.0,0.2302,"airport, fleet, service, data,

"British Airways will furlough more than 30,000 employees under the UK government's job-retention scheme amid the coronavirus crisis, in a move the GMB union describes as “a relief”. “GMB and our sister union Unite have fought hard to secure members' terms, conditions and job security. We believe the current deal, which is nearing its conclusion, secures this,” states GMB national officer Nadine Houghton. Unite says it has been “working around the clock to protect thousands of jobs and to ensure the UK comes out of this unprecedented crisis with a viable aviation sector”. It adds: “Talks with British Airways are ongoing and Unite's priority is always to communicate with our members, who are very anxious at this time but who understand the work that Unite is doing to protect jobs, incomes and futures.” IAG-owned BA confirms that “talks continue” but would not be drawn on the details of the agreement. The UK government has agreed to pay 80% of the wages of directly employed workers, up to a maximum of £2,500 ($3,080) a month, as part of an economic package aimed at minimising the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on its residents' finances. BA's pilot union BALPA disclosed last month that the airline had offered redundancy to an unspecified number of crew members. The union later rejected suggestions that pilots faced a 50% pay cut in April and May. IAG said on 16 March that it would cut capacity by 75% in April and May.

"Boeing has taken initial steps to cut its workforce by offering voluntary separation packages to US-based employees, part of a plan to help the company weather what could be an extended industry downturn. The company's chief executive Dave Calhoun notified employees of Boeing's voluntary workforce reduction efforts in a 2 April memo to staff. The memo stresses that Boeing aims to use “natural and voluntary employment actions to the extent we responsibly can”. “We are initiating a voluntary layoff plan that allows eligible employees who want to exit the company to do so with a pay and benefits package,” says Calhoun's memo. “This move aims to reduce the need for other workforce actions.” Such steps “will bridge us to recovery as long as we're not confronted with more unexpected challenges,” says Calhoun. “I can't predict with certainty what the next few months will bring, but I can commit to being honest about what's happening.” The company expects “several thousand employees” will either take voluntary separation packages or retire, says a Boeing official. The packages are available only to employees in the USA, though Boeing is exploring making similar offers to non-US staff. Boeing does not specify what business areas are likely to be most impacted. However, an official stresses that Boeing continues to recruit new employees for “certain targeted areas, to ensure we're able to meet the needs of our critical programmes, including commitments to our defence and space customers”. Boeing employed 161,100 people at the end of 2019, according to a security filing. Calhoun's memo says the company is “doing everything possible to keep this team intact” so that it can rebound after the coronavirus downturn, which has led the world's airlines to ground thousands of aircraft. Many airlines have entirely halted operations. But, he warns, recovery may not come quick. “It will take time for the aerospace industry to recover from the crisis. When the world emerges from the pandemic, the size of the commercial market and the types of products and services our customers want and need will likely be different,” Calhoun says. “We will need to balance the supply and demand accordingly as the industry goes through the recovery process for years to come.” Boeing will send employees more information about the voluntary layoff programme in the next three to four weeks, the memo says. It adds Boeing continues to work toward certification of the 737 Max. The news comes the week after the US government passed a coronavirus economy relief package that could provide billions of dollars in government loans to “distressed” aerospace companies. Boeing has not said if it intends to apply for government loans, which come with conditions that potentially include government ownership stakes. On 25 March Boeing shuttered its Seattle-area sites for what the company said will be a two-week period due to a coronavirus outbreak among staff.

"EasyJet founder Stelios Haji-Ioannou has followed through on his threat to start dismantling the airline's board if it fails to cancel its Airbus order, requesting a shareholder meeting to discuss the removal of Andreas Bierwirth as a director. The UK budget carrier disclosed in a 2 April regulatory filing that it had received a requisition notice from EasyGroup Holdings proposing a resolution to remove Bierwirth from the board. Haji-Ioannou had warned in late March that, unless the airline terminated its contract with Airbus for additional aircraft, citing the coronavirus pandemic as a justification, he would instigate a “rolling programme” to remove a non-executive director every seven weeks, starting with Bierwirth. EasyJet's founder has described the carrier's outstanding contract for the future delivery of 107 aircraft, including A320neo and A321neo jets, as a “risk to survival” in the current situation. Philanthropic Foundation EasyJet's founder, Stelios Haji-Ioannou, opposes the airline's fleet expansion EasyJet has advised its shareholders to take no action at the current time. “The board is considering the contents of the requisition notice, and further announcements will be made as appropriate,” says the airline. Bernstein analyst Daniel Roeska questions the timing of Haji-Ioannou's intervention. In a 2 April research note, he writes: “At a time when EasyJet's entire fleet is grounded, this is not the time to distract management with what could evolve into a proxy fight – both for the removal and for a potential new election ensuing that step.” Roeska adds that the founder's actions could result in “a prolonged, attention-draining exercise”, and might be detrimental to EasyJet's longer-term future. “There is no doubt in our mind that all airlines have to attempt to delay all capex in the immediate future. But that is not the question: EasyGroup has requested to cancel the Airbus order altogether,” he writes. “We are uncertain of the practicality of this as long as EasyJet remains a going concern, and would assume there to be penalties involved. And, from a strategic point of view, we would see the new aircraft strengthening EasyJet's long-term position.”",4,373,8.0,0.3569,"government, uk, carrier, business, state, share, south, airway, financial, plan","['easyjet', 'founder', 'stelios', 'hajiioannou', 'follow', 'threat', 'start', 'dismantle', 'board', 'fails', 'cancel', 'order', 'request', 'shareholder', 'meeting', 'discus', 'removal', 'andreas', 'bierwirth', 'director', 'uk', 'budget', 'carrier', 'disclose', 'april', 'regulatory', 'filing', 'receive', 'requisition', 'notice', 'easygroup', 'holding', 'propose', 'resolution', 'remove', 'bierwirth', 'board', 'hajiioannou', 'warn', 'late', 'march', 'unless', 'terminate', 'contract', 'additional', 'cite', 'coronavirus', 'pandemic', 'justification', 'instigate', 'roll', 'programme', 'remove', 'nonexecutive', 'director', 'every', 'week', 'start', 'bierwirth', 'easyjet', 'founder', 'described', 'carrier', 'outstanding', 'contract', 'future', 'delivery', 'include', 'jet', 'risk', 'survival', 'current', 'situation', 'philanthropic', 'foundation', 'easyjet', 'founder', 'stelios', 'hajiioannou', 'opposes', 'fleet', 'expansion', 'easyjet', 'advise', 'shareholder', 'take', 'action', 'current', 'board', 'consider', 'content', 'requisition', 'notice', 'far', 'announcement', 'make', 'appropriate', 'say', 'bernstein', 'analyst', 'daniel', 'roeska', 'question', 'timing', 'hajiioannou', 'intervention', 'april', 'research', 'note', 'writes', 'easyjet', 'entire', 'fleet', 'ground', 'distract', 'management', 'evolve', 'proxy', 'fight', 'removal', 'potential', 'election', 'ensue', 'roeska', 'add', 'founder', 'action', 'result', 'prolong', 'attentiondraining', 'exercise', 'might', 'detrimental', 'easyjet', 'longerterm', 'future', 'doubt', 'mind', 'attempt', 'delay', 'capex', 'immediate', 'future', 'question', 'easygroup', 'request', 'cancel', 'order', 'altogether', 'writes', 'uncertain', 'practicality', 'long', 'easyjet', 'remains', 'go', 'concern', 'assume', 'penalty', 'involve', 'strategic', 'point', 'view', 'see', 'strengthen', 'easyjet', 'longterm', 'position']"
"Interim chief executive Siza Mzimela is leaving SA Express after 18 months in the top role at the challenged South African regional carrier. SA Express, which was grounded in part because of the coronavirus crisis on 18 March, is an under a formal business restructuring process. The business practitioners running the airline have applied to have the airline liquidated. Mzimela had returned to SA Express, the airline she had led between 2003 and 2010, as part of a state intervention team initially tasked with helping the carrier through operational difficulties which resulted in its being grounded in May 2018. She became interim chief executive in August of that year. ”In just 18 months, and against incredible odds, the board and management, made huge strides to restore the airline,” the airline says. ”All malfeasance that led to the corrosion of governance structures was eradicated.” It adds: ”Despite her stated intention of a limited tenure at the airline, her commitment and passion for SA Express has been resolute, opting to remain with the team through highly-challenging times.” The board says it recommended three names to the shareholder for the permanent role 12 months ago and awaits a response. In the meantime Thuli Mpshe has been appointed as acting chief executive. While SA Express was able to return to flying after the grounding in May 2018, it has continued to struggle against its historic financial challenges. South Africa's public enterprise minister said the carrier was not a going concern, in explaining the delays in its annual report submission last October. The airline was ultimately ordered to enter a formal business rescue in early February - a ruling initially contested by SA Express. The airline suspended operations on 18 March in response to various pressures. While it cited the impact of the coronavirus outbreak, SA Express indicated this was only one consideration behind its decision, attributing the suspension to “adverse recent developments”. Its future remains in the balance after the business rescue practitioners filed a court application for the liquidation of SA Express. South African media, citing court papers, report that the practitioners have complained that South Africa's department of public enterprises has withheld required funding. But the ministry says: ”The allegations that the government deliberately withheld financial support to the rescuers and that the department's approach to the process was unconstructive, are baseless.”",4,374,8.0,0.4025,"government, uk, carrier, business, state, share, south, airway, financial, plan","['interim', 'chief', 'executive', 'siza', 'mzimela', 'leave', 'sa', 'express', 'month', 'top', 'role', 'challenged', 'south', 'african', 'regional', 'carrier', 'sa', 'express', 'ground', 'part', 'coronavirus', 'crisis', 'march', 'formal', 'business', 'restructuring', 'process', 'business', 'practitioner', 'run', 'apply', 'liquidate', 'mzimela', 'return', 'sa', 'express', 'lead', 'part', 'state', 'intervention', 'team', 'initially', 'tasked', 'help', 'carrier', 'operational', 'difficulty', 'result', 'ground', 'may', 'become', 'interim', 'chief', 'executive', 'august', 'month', 'incredible', 'odds', 'board', 'management', 'make', 'huge', 'stride', 'restore', 'say', 'malfeasance', 'lead', 'corrosion', 'governance', 'structure', 'add', 'despite', 'state', 'intention', 'limited', 'tenure', 'commitment', 'passion', 'sa', 'express', 'resolute', 'opt', 'remain', 'team', 'highlychallenging', 'board', 'say', 'recommend', 'name', 'shareholder', 'permanent', 'role', 'month', 'ago', 'awaits', 'response', 'meantime', 'thuli', 'mpshe', 'appoint', 'act', 'chief', 'executive', 'sa', 'express', 'able', 'return', 'fly', 'ground', 'may', 'continued', 'struggle', 'historic', 'financial', 'challenge', 'south', 'africa', 'public', 'enterprise', 'minister', 'say', 'carrier', 'go', 'concern', 'explain', 'delay', 'annual', 'report', 'submission', 'october', 'ultimately', 'order', 'enter', 'formal', 'business', 'rescue', 'early', 'february', 'ruling', 'initially', 'contest', 'sa', 'express', 'suspend', 'operation', 'march', 'response', 'various', 'pressure', 'cite', 'impact', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'sa', 'express', 'indicate', 'consideration', 'behind', 'decision', 'attribute', 'suspension', 'adverse', 'recent', 'development', 'future', 'remains', 'balance', 'business', 'rescue', 'practitioner', 'file', 'court', 'application', 'liquidation', 'sa', 'express', 'south', 'african', 'medium', 'cite', 'court', 'paper', 'report', 'practitioner', 'complain', 'south', 'africa', 'department', 'public', 'enterprise', 'withheld', 'require', 'funding', 'ministry', 'say', 'allegation', 'government', 'deliberately', 'withheld', 'financial', 'support', 'rescuer', 'department', 'approach', 'process', 'unconstructive', 'baseless']"
"Worldwide passenger traffic may not recover to pre-coronavirus levels until the end of 2021, according to an economic analysis by Airports Council International (ACI) World. The trade association expects the coronavirus outbreak could result in a 38% shortfall in 2020 worldwide passenger traffic against its pre-crisis forecasts, and the pandemic's impact could extend into the second half of the year. The airside shopping arcade of Singapore Changi Airport's Terminal 1 amid the coronavirus crisis ACI, which represents 668 members operating 1,979 airports in 176 countries, had originally forecast that passenger traffic worldwide would reach 9.5 billion this year, but now expects 3.6 billion fewer passengers. That shortfall will result in lost revenues of more than $76 billion, almost half of the $172 billion originally forecast for 2020, the association said today. “Most experts in the air transport industry agree that recovery may take a year to 18 months to reach pre-crisis traffic levels and the industry may not record pre-Covid-19 traffic volumes again before the end of 2021,” said outgoing ACI World director general, Angela Gittens, who retires at the end of June and will be succeeded by Luis Felipe de Oliveira. Gittens added: “A drastic decline of such magnitude for the global airport industry represents an existential threat.” Airports are battling the crisis by delaying capital spending, shutting terminals and reducing staff costs. Gittens urged governments to put in place economic policies to save jobs, protect operations to help the industry to get through the crisis and assure its subsequent recovery. “A fair and equitable global economic policy response is required to safeguard essential airport operations, to protect millions of jobs worldwide, and to ensure the survival of the industry and lay the foundation for a fair recovery.” For the recently concluded quarter, ACI expects airports in all regions to lose passenger traffic at double-digit rates. Asia-Pacific is set to be the hardest hit, with an estimated 39% loss, followed by a 24% reduction in Europe and 21% in North America. ACI also cautions that international passenger traffic could take longer to recover than domestic traffic. This echoes the view expressed by Air New Zealand on 31 March, that international tourism could be slow to recover, because countries would be cautious about opening their borders. ACI World states: “Any international flight implies reciprocal permissions, while various states will emerge from the current crisis at different times with varying pace of relaxation of the recently imposed restrictions.”",4,375,9.0,0.3138,"industry, crisis, demand, coronavirus, global, iata, market, level, cargo, expect","['worldwide', 'passenger', 'traffic', 'may', 'recover', 'precoronavirus', 'level', 'end', 'accord', 'economic', 'analysis', 'airport', 'council', 'international', 'aci', 'world', 'trade', 'association', 'expect', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'result', 'shortfall', 'worldwide', 'passenger', 'traffic', 'precrisis', 'forecast', 'pandemic', 'impact', 'extend', 'second', 'half', 'airside', 'shopping', 'arcade', 'singapore', 'changi', 'airport', 'terminal', 'amid', 'coronavirus', 'crisis', 'aci', 'represent', 'member', 'operating', 'airport', 'country', 'originally', 'forecast', 'passenger', 'traffic', 'worldwide', 'reach', 'expect', 'passenger', 'shortfall', 'result', 'lose', 'revenue', 'almost', 'half', 'originally', 'forecast', 'association', 'say', 'today', 'expert', 'transport', 'industry', 'agree', 'recovery', 'may', 'take', 'month', 'reach', 'precrisis', 'traffic', 'level', 'industry', 'may', 'record', 'precoronavirus', 'traffic', 'volume', 'end', 'say', 'outgo', 'aci', 'world', 'director', 'general', 'angela', 'gittens', 'retires', 'end', 'june', 'succeed', 'luis', 'felipe', 'de', 'oliveira', 'gittens', 'add', 'drastic', 'decline', 'magnitude', 'global', 'airport', 'industry', 'represent', 'existential', 'airport', 'battling', 'crisis', 'delay', 'capital', 'spending', 'shut', 'terminal', 'reduce', 'staff', 'cost', 'gittens', 'urge', 'government', 'put', 'place', 'economic', 'policy', 'save', 'job', 'protect', 'operation', 'help', 'industry', 'get', 'crisis', 'assure', 'subsequent', 'recovery', 'fair', 'equitable', 'global', 'economic', 'policy', 'response', 'require', 'safeguard', 'essential', 'airport', 'operation', 'protect', 'job', 'worldwide', 'ensure', 'survival', 'industry', 'lay', 'foundation', 'fair', 'recently', 'conclude', 'quarter', 'aci', 'expect', 'airport', 'region', 'lose', 'passenger', 'traffic', 'doubledigit', 'rate', 'asiapacific', 'set', 'hardest', 'hit', 'estimate', 'loss', 'follow', 'reduction', 'europe', 'north', 'america', 'aci', 'caution', 'international', 'passenger', 'traffic', 'take', 'longer', 'recover', 'domestic', 'traffic', 'echo', 'view', 'express', 'zealand', 'march', 'international', 'tourism', 'slow', 'recover', 'country', 'cautious', 'opening', 'border', 'aci', 'world', 'state', 'international', 'implies', 'reciprocal', 'permission', 'various', 'state', 'emerge', 'current', 'crisis', 'different', 'vary', 'pace', 'relaxation', 'recently', 'impose', 'restriction']"
"Budget carrier Wizz Air has become one of the first European airlines to detail the full coronavirus impact on traffic in March, a month during which airlines started embarking on widespread fleet grounding. Wizz Air says booked passenger numbers fell by nearly 36%, to 1.75 million, as it cut capacity by more than a third over the month, but it maintained an average load factor of 92%. It had grounded some 85% of its fleet by around the third week of March. While per-passenger carbon dioxide emissions declined by 3.4%, it says, the overall impact of the slashed capacity was to cut total emission by 35%. The airline's financial year ended on 31 March but it has yet to detail the fiscal impact of the crisis on the company. Since 20 February its share price has more than halved. Wizz Air says it continued to operate repatriation and rescue flights throughout March, including services from North America to Hungary.

"SriLankan Airlines is suspending all operations for nearly two weeks in what it describes as “bleak times” and the biggest challenge in its 40-year operating history. The Colombo-based carrier plans to halt all regularly scheduled passenger flights between 8 April and 21 April, with the exception of cargo and repatriation flights. This is due to coronavirus related travel restrictions governments have put it place at destinations to which the airline operates. However, SriLankan says it could resume services earlier if the situation changes. Cirium schedules data show that the airline flew to 36 destinations from its base at Colombo's Bandaranaike International in March. The company says it is “constantly reviewing the market conditions and the restrictions imposed by the various authorities and will be ready to recommence its operations at short notice even before the 21st April 2020, in the event such restrictions are lifted”. “Despite various challenges faced by the airline throughout its four-decade tenure, this is by far the most difficult and unfortunate period that the airline is passing, similar to all its counterparts across the globe and communities in general”. It adds: “As done in the past and ever since the outbreak of the pandemic, the airline has been fulfilling its duty as the national carrier by reaching out to fellow Sri Lankans seeking passage home and uplifting essential items such as medical aid. The airline is fully prepared to steer any national endeavour expected of it, thus playing its role in Sri Lanka's efforts to combat Covid-19.” Among the Asia-Pacific flag carriers, SriLankan Airlines operates a relatively small fleet of just 26 aircraft, including Airbus A320 family aircraft and A330 widebodies, though every single one of those aircraft is leased. Major lessors AerCap, Air Lease and Avolon are the most exposed, while three other smaller lessors have a more limited exposure.

"Qatar Airways is suspending flights to New York and the Spanish cities Madrid and Barcelona, but vows to reinstate them “in line with a return to regular conditions”. Framing its decision, the Oneworld member says it “continues to temporarily hold flights to severely affected countries due to entry restrictions implemented by many governments to prevent the spread of coronavirus”. The airline is pausing operations to New York JFK as of today, Madrid Barajas from 4 April and Barcelona El Prat from 5 April. Amid a widespread industry shutdown, Qatar Airways has shown resistance to axing services, even increasing its capacity to some destinations. It says today it is “working with governments around the world to maintain a strong schedule of flights, and organising charter flights where needed”. A series of measures have been put in place to reduce the risk of transmitting the coronavirus on Qatar Airways flights, including staff training, the thermal screening of crew on departure and arrival, and the use of quarantine. “As the current pandemic has escalated, cabin crew have been authorised to wear surgical masks and disposable gloves,” says the Middle Eastern carrier. It has also amended the distribution of its cabin crew on flights to minimise the risk of them catching or transmitting the disease. At its hub at Hamad international Airport, the majority of the non-essential passenger lounges have been closed and an enhanced cleaning and disinfection regime enacted. Social distancing is also being enforced. Qatar Airways operates to 165 destinations, Cirium data shows, and has 246 aircraft in its fleet, of which 83 are currently stored.

"Airports across Asia-Pacific are temporarily shutting terminals, shops and have put spending on hold as they grapple with traffic restrictions due to the coronavirus outbreak. “Every passenger lost by an airline is equally a passenger lost by an airport,” says Stefano Baronci, director general of Airport Council International (ACI) Asia-Pacific. The trade association warned in a 27 March statement that airports in the region stand to lose $5.6 billion worth of revenue in the recently concluded quarter and called for government support. In Indonesia, Jakarta's Soekarno-Hatta International airport will halt operations at two terminals during April and May. Thailand's Phuket International airport will be closed from 10-30 April to limit the spread of the virus. Fiji's Nadi International airport has also closed, after operating its last scheduled flight to Japan over the weekend. Operator Melbourne Airport, which saw international passenger numbers down 17% in February after the devastating bushfires in Australia, says it feels the loss of each passenger several times over. “The passenger who doesn't fly, also doesn't catch a SkyBus, or an Uber, or a taxi. They don't buy a coffee or a book, grab a meal or pick up a souvenir,” chief executive, Lyell Strambi said on 12 March. Perth Airport said on 22 March that the coronavirus impact on its passenger numbers and revenue has been “immediate and devastating”. The operator has put a freeze on all non-essential expenditure and placed majority of capital projects on hold. Likewise, Auckland Airport disclosed on 26 March that it is suspending projects with a completed value of over NZ$2 billion ($1.2 billion), until there is more certainty over market conditions. These include a second runway and the construction of a hotel. The airport saw around 30 international flights a day in March, compared to 80 in the year-ago period. Many retail outlets have already been shuttered to meet New Zealand's lockdown rules, but the airport says it will likely close some parts of both the domestic and international terminals in coming weeks to reflect the reduced demand. “Everything is operating at the moment, but if we're able to close down parts of the terminals while they are not required, we'll do so,” general manager operations Anna Cassels-Brown said in a statement on 31 March. Meanwhile, South Korea's Incheon International airport said on March 26 said passenger numbers in the third week of March were down almost 92% while its daily passenger numbers fell to below 10,000 on March 24, the first time that has happened since it opened in 2001. If the trend continues, it forecasts a 70% decline in passenger traffic this year. The operator has moved to its emergency management plan, which will see it shut some operations and it plans to issue a W9.8 billion ($8 million) bond to mitigate the profit hit. Airports of Thailand said on March 23 that aeronautical revenue in February and March will be down by 30% after almost 33,000 flights were cancelled from 24 January to 28 March. Non-aeronautical revenue will also be impacted by plans to offer fee reductions for operators at its six airports. Airport Authority Hong Kong has come up with a HK$1 billion ($130 million) relief package for the airport sector, backed by the government. This includes a waiver of air traffic control charges and direct financial assistance, as well as rental relief worth HK$320 million.

"The pilot of a China Airlines Boeing 747-400 freighter that undershot a runway at Taipei Taoyuan International Airport had inadequate rest – thanks to a crying baby at home – which affected his alertness. Releasing its final report into the 2018 incident, the Taiwan Transportation Safety Board (TTSB) also found that the co-pilot, who was flying the plane, inappropriately operated the freighter as it landed. On 13 December 2018, the 747-400 freighter, registered B-18717, was operating flight CI 6844 from Hong Kong to Taipei Taoyuan. Its main landing gear touched down about 27m before the runway touchdown point and struck several runway lights. The hard landing also caused minor damage to the main landing gear tires. Investigations revealed that the 30-year-old co-pilot, who was the pilot flying, had disengaged autopilot after the aircraft descended past 1,800 feet. As the freighter approached Runway 05L, it appeared that the altitude was higher than the approach glide path. While the altitude got corrected immediately, at around 137 feet the aircraft again began to fall below the glide path. Investigations revealed that the co-pilot had failed to maintain the normal speed and rate of descent by utilising pitch control and thrust. He failed to determine his mistake in time, which led to the hard landing before the touchdown point. “[This indicates] that [the co-pilot] ...did not meet the safety landing standards [for landing the aircraft manually],” the TTSB states. Investigations also revealed that two days before the incident, the 44-year-old pilot had poor sleep quality after returning from a late night flight, because of a crying baby in his home. The night before the incident, the baby's crying also affected his sleep quality.  This affected alertness during the flight, especially when his colleague had issues on final approach. “When the aircraft had an abnormal situation, it was too late to take-over the operation, or call [for a] go-around, [and] it caused the hard landing,” the board states. Furthermore, after the freighter undershot the runway, the crew did not report the incident to the airline, instead heading home after their duties were done. To this end, the TTSB has urged China Airlines to beef up training for its junior pilots on manual landing capabilities. At the same time, it is recommending that the SkyTeam carrier enforce the upgrading of skills of less-experienced pilots and co-pilots.",4,380,7.0,0.501,"crew, runway, inquiry, land, approach, accident, investigator, captain, incident, pilot","['pilot', 'freighter', 'undershot', 'runway', 'taipei', 'taoyuan', 'international', 'airport', 'inadequate', 'rest', 'thanks', 'cry', 'baby', 'home', 'affected', 'alertness', 'release', 'final', 'report', 'incident', 'taiwan', 'transportation', 'safety', 'board', 'ttsb', 'found', 'copilot', 'fly', 'plane', 'inappropriately', 'operate', 'freighter', 'land', 'december', 'freighter', 'register', 'operating', 'ci', 'hong', 'kong', 'taipei', 'taoyuan', 'main', 'land', 'gear', 'touch', 'runway', 'touchdown', 'point', 'struck', 'several', 'runway', 'light', 'hard', 'land', 'cause', 'minor', 'damage', 'main', 'land', 'gear', 'tire', 'investigation', 'reveal', 'copilot', 'pilot', 'fly', 'disengage', 'autopilot', 'descend', 'past', 'foot', 'freighter', 'approach', 'runway', 'appear', 'altitude', 'high', 'approach', 'glide', 'path', 'altitude', 'get', 'correct', 'immediately', 'around', 'foot', 'begin', 'fall', 'glide', 'path', 'investigation', 'reveal', 'copilot', 'fail', 'maintain', 'normal', 'speed', 'rate', 'descent', 'utilise', 'pitch', 'control', 'thrust', 'fail', 'determine', 'mistake', 'lead', 'hard', 'land', 'touchdown', 'point', 'indicates', 'copilot', 'meet', 'safety', 'land', 'standard', 'land', 'manually', 'ttsb', 'state', 'investigation', 'reveal', 'day', 'incident', 'pilot', 'poor', 'sleep', 'quality', 'return', 'late', 'night', 'cry', 'baby', 'home', 'night', 'incident', 'baby', 'cry', 'affected', 'sleep', 'quality', 'affected', 'alertness', 'especially', 'colleague', 'issue', 'final', 'approach', 'abnormal', 'situation', 'late', 'takeover', 'operation', 'call', 'goaround', 'cause', 'hard', 'land', 'board', 'state', 'furthermore', 'freighter', 'undershot', 'runway', 'crew', 'report', 'incident', 'instead', 'head', 'home', 'duty', 'end', 'ttsb', 'urge', 'beef', 'training', 'junior', 'pilot', 'manual', 'land', 'capability', 'recommend', 'skyteam', 'carrier', 'enforce', 'upgrade', 'skill', 'lessexperienced', 'pilot', 'copilot']"
"Indonesian low-cost carrier Citilink posted an operating profit of $67.8 million in 2019, marking a return to profitability for the Garuda Indonesia subsidiary. This is a significant turnaround for the airline, which recorded an operating loss of $54.6 million in 2018, Garuda's 2019 annual report shows. Revenue for the year ended 31 December 2019 was up 17.2% to nearly $844 million. It also posted a net profit of $42.6 million, a stark contrast to the net loss of $42 million in 2018. Citilink was able to raise its yields by 44.6% to 7.7 cents in 2019, despite passenger numbers for the year falling 17.6% to 12.2 million. Although its ASK declined 8.5%, RPK fell by a larger 17%, and seat load factor was down 7.6 percentage points to 75.2%. Cost per ASK was up 11.8% to 5.5 cents, and excluding fuel, this swelled 27.3% from 2.9 cents to 3.7 cents. Garuda adds that Citilink will continue to focus on the low-cost market, both domestically and internationally, and to operate turboprop aircraft transferred by its parent. The transfer began in 2019, and will continue into 2020. Cirium fleets data show that Citilink currently operates 38 Airbus A320ceo and 10 A320neo aircraft, two A330-900neos, six ATR 72-600s, and one Boeing 737-500 freighter.",4,381,3.0,0.4203,"passenger, loss, operating, revenue, traffic, month, increase, capacity, decline, result","['indonesian', 'lowcost', 'carrier', 'citilink', 'post', 'operating', 'profit', 'mark', 'return', 'profitability', 'garuda', 'indonesia', 'subsidiary', 'significant', 'turnaround', 'record', 'operating', 'loss', 'garuda', 'annual', 'report', 'revenue', 'end', 'december', 'nearly', 'post', 'net', 'profit', 'stark', 'contrast', 'net', 'loss', 'citilink', 'able', 'raise', 'yield', 'cent', 'despite', 'passenger', 'number', 'fall', 'although', 'ask', 'decline', 'rpk', 'fell', 'large', 'seat', 'load', 'factor', 'percentage', 'point', 'cost', 'per', 'ask', 'cent', 'exclude', 'fuel', 'swell', 'cent', 'cent', 'garuda', 'add', 'citilink', 'continue', 'focus', 'lowcost', 'market', 'domestically', 'internationally', 'operate', 'turboprop', 'transfer', 'parent', 'transfer', 'begin', 'continue', 'fleet', 'data', 'citilink', 'currently', 'operates', 'atr', 'freighter']"
"Air China has joined a growing list of airlines in warning of an operating loss “in the short term”, as the coronavirus outbreak continues to wreak havoc. Discussing the outlook for 2020 in its full-year results, the Air China group noted the impact that the outbreak – which originated in the Hubei province of central China –has had on passenger travel demand. This was particularly so after the Lunar New Year, in late-January, when it saw domestic travel demand plummet. “Global travel restriction has also reduced the demand for international routes,” it adds. “[A] loss may be incurred inevitably in the short term,” the carrier states, but did not elaborate. To mitigate the outbreak's impact, Air China says it is working to optimise capacity resource distribution, strengthen its cost control and improve its yield management. For 2019, Air China posted a full-year profit of CNY14.6 billion, an increase of 2.1% year-on-year. The Star Alliance carrier is the only Chinese carrier so far to have raised the red flag on the outbreak's impact on profitability – compatriots China Southern and China Eastern, in their respective annual results discussion, did not offer any similar insights. China Eastern states that the outbreak brought about “significant uncertainty” for the year. China Southern echoed similar sentiments, adding that the outbreak has impacted the group's operations and financial position”, though it is confident in its liquidity position. February was a difficult month for China's three largest carriers as the country battled the outbreak and was the subject of travel restrictions globally.

"Lower expenses, coupled with more passengers carried, helped push Air China's 2019 operating profit slightly higher. It posted a full-year profit of CNY14.6 billion ($2.06 billion) for 2019, an increase of 2.1% compared to the previous year. Group revenue for the year fell marginally – at about 0.4% – to CNY136 billion, led by drop in air traffic revenue, but this was offset by increases in operating revenue. By geographic region, the Air China Group saw increases in revenue from most of Asia, except Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. Revenue slipped for Europe and North America. Expenses fell 0.74% to about CNY126 billion, on the back of drops in jet fuel costs and MRO costs. Attributable net profit came in at CNY6.42 billion, a drop of 12.7% year-on-year. For the year, the Air China Group, which includes Shenzhen Airlines, Air Macau and Dalian Airlines, carried 115 million passengers, a 4.8% increase compared to the previous year. Group ASKs rose 5.2%, while RPKs increased 5.7%. Overall passenger load factor inched up marginally – by 0.42 percentage points – to 81%. However, the group saw yields shrink 2.2% for the year.

"Walter Cho was re-elected as the chairman of Hanjin KAL at an annual general meeting held on 27 March. Hanjin KAL, the parent group of Korean Air, is controlled by the Cho family. Walter Cho succeeded his father, the late Cho Yang-ho, as head of Hanjin KAL in 2003. He took over as Korean Air's chairman and chief executive after Cho senior's death in April 2019. The carrier tells Cirium that the younger Cho received support from nearly 57% of 3,600 shareholders who voted, with a collective equity stake of just under 85%. Two other nominees, Sin-Bae Kim and Gyeong-tae Bae, had their nominations rejected. Reference material prepared by Hanjin KAL for the meeting describes Kim as a former chairman of SK Corp, while Bae is a former vice-president at Samsung Electronics. Kim was nominated by a three-party alliance that has demanded that Walter Cho be replaced by professional managers. This alliance comprises Cho Hyun-ah, the private equity fund KCGI, and Bando Engineering & Construction, which hold 6.5%, 18.7%, and 16.9% stakes in Hanjin KAL, respectively, amounting to a collective 42% stake. Walter Cho, his family members and affiliates hold a 22.2% stake, while Delta Air Lines recently increased its stake in Hanjin KAL to 14.9% Cho Hyun-ah is Walter Cho's sister and the eldest of the late Cho Yang-ho's three children. Youngest sibling Emily Cho and Cho Hyun-ah both stepped down from their executive positions at Korean Air in April 2018. Walter Cho says in a statement issued after the shareholders' meeting: “The meeting served as an opportunity to hear the voices of various shareholders and employees, and will act as a stepping stone in the future development and growth of Hanjin Group. “Hanjin Group will now start afresh, respecting the wishes of the people.” He reiterated the difficulties faced by the airline industry due to the coronavirus, while stating that over 90% of Korean's aircraft are grounded. “All of us at Hanjin Group are devoting our efforts to overcome the crisis. We will take necessary self-help measures to improve our financial structure.

"Garuda Indonesia posted an operating profit of $147 million for 2019, a turnaround from the $199 million operating loss in 2018. Revenue grew 5.6% to $4.57 billion, driven by a 6.9% increase in passenger revenue. Total costs declined by 4% to $4.4 billion, as the group carrier tightened its belt. Costs relating to flight operations, aircraft maintenance and passenger services were all cut. There was, however, a 16% rise in expenses relating to ticketing, sales and promotional activities.

"Airbus A220 operators are being instructed to remove certain full-authority digital engine control software, and install a new version, after a series of engine failures involving fracture of low-pressure compressor rotors. Four such incidents have been registered, says the US FAA in a directive for the type's Pratt & Whitney PW1500G powerplant. Three of the incidents, last year, involved Swiss aircraft while the fourth, last month, affected an Air Baltic jet. Analysis has indicated that low-pressure compressor vane schedules were generating a condition within the engine that led to “acoustic resonance” and damaged the stage-one rotor, says the FAA, leading to its failure.  Swiss A220s were involved in three of the four engine-failure incidents Interim action had already been ordered for A220s – including limiting thrust at high altitude – to protect the aircraft against uncontained engine failure. But the analysis of the vane scheduling has prompted a revision of the FADEC software intended to avoid the resonance phenomenon. The latest directive instructs operators to remove certain FADEC software earlier than version V2.11.9.2 and install an update. Engines which have accumulated less than 300 cycles must be modified within 15 cycles, others within 90 days. The FAA states that the failures of the stage-one rotors occurred on engines which had been shipped to operators as spares, and were not delivered installed on aircraft. Failures occurred within 300 cycles of their subsequent installation. Spare engines which have been newly fitted to aircraft carry the “highest risk” of rotor failure, the FAA adds.",4,386,6.0,0.545,"engine, maintenance, fuel, takeoff, result, failure, system, problem, power, issue","['operator', 'instruct', 'remove', 'certain', 'fullauthority', 'digital', 'engine', 'control', 'software', 'install', 'version', 'series', 'engine', 'failure', 'involve', 'fracture', 'lowpressure', 'compressor', 'rotor', 'incident', 'register', 'say', 'u', 'faa', 'directive', 'type', 'pratt', 'whitney', 'powerplant', 'incident', 'involve', 'swiss', 'fourth', 'month', 'affected', 'baltic', 'jet', 'analysis', 'indicate', 'lowpressure', 'compressor', 'vane', 'schedule', 'generate', 'condition', 'within', 'engine', 'lead', 'acoustic', 'resonance', 'damage', 'stageone', 'rotor', 'say', 'faa', 'lead', 'failure', 'swiss', 'involve', 'enginefailure', 'incident', 'interim', 'action', 'already', 'order', 'include', 'limit', 'thrust', 'high', 'altitude', 'protect', 'uncontained', 'engine', 'failure', 'analysis', 'vane', 'schedule', 'prompt', 'revision', 'fadec', 'software', 'intend', 'avoid', 'resonance', 'phenomenon', 'late', 'directive', 'instructs', 'operator', 'remove', 'certain', 'fadec', 'software', 'earlier', 'version', 'install', 'update', 'engine', 'accumulate', 'less', 'cycle', 'must', 'modify', 'within', 'cycle', 'others', 'within', 'day', 'faa', 'state', 'failure', 'stageone', 'rotor', 'occur', 'engine', 'ship', 'operator', 'spare', 'deliver', 'instal', 'failure', 'occur', 'within', 'cycle', 'subsequent', 'installation', 'spare', 'engine', 'newly', 'fit', 'carry', 'high', 'risk', 'rotor', 'failure', 'faa', 'add']"
"Virgin Australia has implemented new landing gear wheel inspection guidelines, following the failure of a main landing gear wheel on a Boeing 737-800. Releasing its final report into the 2017 incident, investigators from the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) found that the number one main wheel ruptured because of loosened tie bolt assemblies. The loose tie bolt assemblies were caused by the presence of anti-seize compounds, which affected clamping forces, ATSB states. The incident, which involved the aircraft registered VH-VUH, occurred at Brisbane Airport. The narrowbody was to operate a flight to Melbourne, and was holding at a taxiway when the flight crew heard a loud noise. Thinking it was a burst tyre on the left main landing gear wheel, the crew attempted to return the aircraft to the gate. However, they were held short, when an engineer noticed that the number one main wheel assembly had failed. The aircraft could not be jacked and towed via the axle because of the damaged wheel, the ATSB notes. Instead, engineers performed a double wheel change on the tarmac, before the aircraft was towed to a maintenance facility for inspection. The inner half of the wheel assembly was found to be fractured. The tie bolt assemblies that connect the two halves of the wheel were all present, but some bolts were found to be loose. ATSB's own inspections revealed that 12 of the 18 tie bolt assemblies were so loose that they could be twisted by hand. It also found several nuts “noticeably backed off” the thread. “The tie bolt assemblies were visually inspected and found to be the correct part in every instance with no evidence of damage,” investigators state. However, they note “a region of fracture surface” near one of the tie bolt holes exhibited fatigue crack progression marks. In its findings, the ATSB says the loosening of the tie bolt assemblies were “likely due to grease or anti-seize compound between the mating wheel halves.” “This resulted in fatigue cracking and ultimately, wheel rupture,” the agency states. It also found that there were “no inspections for detecting loose tie bolt assemblies in service, and no effective mandated risk controls to prevent wheel rupture”. Following the incident, Virgin Australia performed a fleet-wide inspection of the particular wheel-type. It found two other wheels that had loose tie bolts. One of them was “relatively new, and had not yet required a tyre change”, the ATSB notes. To this end, Virgin Australia has implemented regular inspections to identify and prevent the loosening of tie bolt assemblies. Safran, which manufactured the wheels, also updated its maintenance manual with more detailed instructions on applying anti-seize compound. The ATSB states that the particular wheel type was installed on approximately 2,000 737 NG aircraft in service worldwide. Cirium fleets data indicates VH-VUH was delivered to the Australian carrier in 2006, and briefly operated with its New Zealand unit between 2008 and 2015. Virgin Australia operates a fleet of 51 737-800s and two 737-700s.

"European and US safety regulators are cautioning operators over the potential effects of misapplying biocides to aircraft fuel, including multi-engine loss of thrust control. The manufacturer of one type of biocide, however, has ordered a suspension to using the product after an incident which appeared not to have resulted specifically from misapplication. Biocides are used to counter the spread of waterborne micro-organisms which, if water accumulates in fuel tanks, feed off hydrocarbons in the fuel. While the European Union Aviation Safety Agency says that “good housekeeping” to prevent water accumulation is the primary defence, it acknowledges that biocides are necessary if contamination is detected and states that personnel must follow correct procedures regarding method and dosage. EASA says that “several” recent events have been recorded involving “adverse engine effects”, both in flight and on the ground, after biocide treatment. While two of these resulted from overdose of the fuel system, one incident – involving the use of DuPont's Kathon FP 1.5 biocide – has revealed “no evidence” of misapplication. DuPont has instructed operators and distributors to cease using the product immediately for aviation fuel treatment, says EASA, while investigators probe a possible “higher susceptibility” of some engine fuel-control systems to the biocide. The US FAA states that General Electric is following up the DuPont instruction by taking measures to remove Kathon FP 1.5 from its list of approved fuel additives across all its engines, pending further testing. Neither EASA nor the FAA has yet resorted to issuing a specific airworthiness directive, limiting their responses to safety bulletins, but the FAA says that “some individual [directive] action” might be necessary on certain aircraft-engine combinations. The FAA notes that Kathon FP 1.5 is one of the two most common biocides in operation, the other being Biobor JF. It says that concentrations of these additives in uplifted fuel should be respectively limited to 0.135ml and 0.269ml per litre. Both EASA and the FAA are recommending that relevant parties should ensure they have adequate procedures in place for biocide treatment and, after Kathon FP 1.5 discontinuance, measures are taken to prevent biological risks – including non-use of contaminated fuel.",3,388,6.0,0.4616,"engine, maintenance, fuel, takeoff, result, failure, system, problem, power, issue","['european', 'u', 'safety', 'regulator', 'caution', 'operator', 'potential', 'effect', 'misapply', 'biocides', 'fuel', 'include', 'multiengine', 'loss', 'thrust', 'control', 'manufacturer', 'type', 'biocide', 'however', 'order', 'suspension', 'use', 'product', 'incident', 'appear', 'result', 'specifically', 'misapplication', 'biocides', 'use', 'counter', 'spread', 'waterborne', 'microorganism', 'water', 'accumulates', 'fuel', 'tank', 'feed', 'hydrocarbon', 'fuel', 'european', 'union', 'safety', 'agency', 'say', 'good', 'housekeep', 'prevent', 'water', 'accumulation', 'primary', 'defence', 'acknowledges', 'biocides', 'necessary', 'contamination', 'detect', 'state', 'personnel', 'must', 'follow', 'correct', 'procedure', 'regard', 'method', 'dosage', 'easa', 'say', 'several', 'recent', 'event', 'record', 'involve', 'adverse', 'engine', 'effect', 'ground', 'biocide', 'treatment', 'result', 'overdose', 'fuel', 'system', 'incident', 'involve', 'use', 'dupont', 'kathon', 'fp', 'biocide', 'reveal', 'evidence', 'misapplication', 'dupont', 'instruct', 'operator', 'distributor', 'cease', 'use', 'product', 'immediately', 'fuel', 'treatment', 'say', 'easa', 'investigator', 'probe', 'possible', 'high', 'susceptibility', 'engine', 'fuelcontrol', 'system', 'biocide', 'u', 'faa', 'state', 'general', 'electric', 'follow', 'dupont', 'instruction', 'take', 'measure', 'remove', 'kathon', 'fp', 'list', 'approve', 'fuel', 'additive', 'across', 'engine', 'pending', 'far', 'test', 'neither', 'easa', 'faa', 'yet', 'resort', 'issue', 'specific', 'airworthiness', 'directive', 'limit', 'response', 'safety', 'bulletin', 'faa', 'say', 'individual', 'directive', 'action', 'might', 'necessary', 'certain', 'aircraftengine', 'combination', 'faa', 'note', 'kathon', 'fp', 'common', 'biocides', 'operation', 'biobor', 'jf', 'say', 'concentration', 'additive', 'uplifted', 'fuel', 'respectively', 'limited', 'per', 'litre', 'easa', 'faa', 'recommend', 'relevant', 'party', 'ensure', 'adequate', 'procedure', 'place', 'biocide', 'treatment', 'kathon', 'fp', 'discontinuance', 'measure', 'take', 'prevent', 'biological', 'risk', 'include', 'nonuse', 'contaminate', 'fuel']"
"Air New Zealand has detailed how the coronavirus pandemic has all but wiped out its revenue this year and says it will start the process of laying off up to 3,500 workers this week In an email to staff, chief executive Greg Foran says revenue is on track to plummet by NZ$5 billion ($3 billion) this year. “Unfortunately, Covid-19 has seen us go from having revenue of $5.8 billion to what is shaping up to be less than $500 million annually based on the current booking patterns we are seeing,” he wrote in the email, sent on Monday evening. That has the potential to be “catastrophic” for Air New Zealand, he said. Foran states that the only way that revenue forecast will be improved this year is if Kiwis embrace domestic travel after the country leaves its current state of lockdown. Under New Zealand's current Level 4 lockdown, domestic travel is limited to essential workers. All others have been told remain home, except for essential shopping and medical care. “The harsh reality is that most countries will take a cautious approach to allowing international tourism in the next year, New Zealand included,” he says in the email. “And international tourism flows make up two thirds of Air New Zealand's revenue. So, that is billions of dollars in ticket sales we won't be booking and more than 1.5 million tourists who won't be arriving here to fly on our domestic network.” Foran expects Air New Zealand will therefore be a “much smaller” airline after the crisis, adding it could take years to get back to its former size. “We expect that even in a year's time we will be at least 30% smaller than we are today,” he predicts. Air New Zealand has cut 95% of its flights as it battles the crisis and has agreed a standby loan from the government of up to NZ$900 million. Its current focus is on international cargo flights and domestic flights for essential workers, although many of those are operating at low loads and have been cancelled or consolidated, according to posts on social media by chief revenue officer Cam Wallace. Wallace states on Twitter today that the airline's cargo and engineering teams are looking at extending cargo capacity by retrofitting a Boeing 777-200. Foran says with a monthly labour cost of NZ$110 million and little revenue coming in, Air New Zealand's cash balance will fall by tens of millions of dollars each week. He predicts the carrier will need to draw on that government loan within months. The carrier will therefore start 3,500 job cuts within its 12,500-strong workforce this week, commencing with staff in international regions. Local job cuts will follow once a final plan has been agreed in the coming days. “The extent of this reduction is based on conservative assumptions and we may have to change these as the situation evolves, especially if the Level 4 Alert goes beyond the planned 28 days or border restrictions are in place for a prolonged period,” Foran cautions.",3,389,2.0,0.2653,"executive, chief, cut, add, situation, staff, crisis, make, coronavirus, employee","['zealand', 'detailed', 'coronavirus', 'pandemic', 'wipe', 'revenue', 'say', 'start', 'process', 'lay', 'worker', 'week', 'email', 'staff', 'chief', 'executive', 'greg', 'foran', 'say', 'revenue', 'track', 'plummet', 'nz', 'unfortunately', 'coronavirus', 'see', 'u', 'go', 'revenue', 'shape', 'less', 'annually', 'base', 'current', 'book', 'pattern', 'see', 'write', 'email', 'sent', 'monday', 'even', 'potential', 'catastrophic', 'zealand', 'say', 'foran', 'state', 'way', 'revenue', 'forecast', 'improve', 'kiwi', 'embrace', 'domestic', 'travel', 'country', 'leaf', 'current', 'state', 'lockdown', 'zealand', 'current', 'level', 'lockdown', 'domestic', 'travel', 'limited', 'essential', 'worker', 'others', 'told', 'remain', 'home', 'except', 'essential', 'shopping', 'medical', 'care', 'harsh', 'reality', 'country', 'take', 'cautious', 'approach', 'allow', 'international', 'tourism', 'next', 'zealand', 'include', 'say', 'email', 'international', 'tourism', 'flow', 'make', 'third', 'zealand', 'revenue', 'dollar', 'ticket', 'sale', 'wo', 'book', 'tourist', 'wo', 'arrive', 'fly', 'domestic', 'foran', 'expect', 'zealand', 'therefore', 'much', 'small', 'crisis', 'add', 'take', 'get', 'back', 'former', 'size', 'expect', 'even', 'least', 'small', 'today', 'predicts', 'zealand', 'cut', 'battle', 'crisis', 'agree', 'standby', 'loan', 'government', 'nz', 'current', 'focus', 'international', 'cargo', 'domestic', 'essential', 'worker', 'although', 'many', 'operating', 'low', 'load', 'cancel', 'consolidated', 'accord', 'post', 'social', 'medium', 'chief', 'revenue', 'officer', 'cam', 'wallace', 'wallace', 'state', 'twitter', 'today', 'cargo', 'engineering', 'team', 'look', 'extend', 'cargo', 'capacity', 'retrofit', 'foran', 'say', 'monthly', 'labour', 'cost', 'nz', 'little', 'revenue', 'come', 'zealand', 'cash', 'balance', 'fall', 'dollar', 'week', 'predicts', 'carrier', 'need', 'draw', 'government', 'loan', 'within', 'month', 'carrier', 'therefore', 'start', 'job', 'cut', 'within', 'workforce', 'week', 'commence', 'staff', 'international', 'region', 'local', 'job', 'cut', 'follow', 'final', 'plan', 'agree', 'come', 'day', 'extent', 'reduction', 'base', 'conservative', 'assumption', 'may', 'change', 'situation', 'evolves', 'especially', 'level', 'alert', 'go', 'beyond', 'plan', 'day', 'border', 'restriction', 'place', 'prolong', 'period', 'foran', 'caution']"
"The US Air Force (USAF) says fuel is leaking from its Boeing KC-46A Pegasus in-flight refuelling tanker. The problem, which was first discovered in July 2019, was recently upgraded to a category 1 deficiency, says the service on 30 March. “The Air Force and Boeing are working together to determine the root cause and implement corrective actions. The KC-46 programme office continues to monitor the entire KC-46 fleet and is enhancing acceptance testing of the fuel system to identify potential leaks at the factory where they can be repaired prior to delivery,” says the USAF. “Boeing is contractually obligated to remedy this deficiency at no additional cost to the government.” Boeing's production of KC-46A aircraft in Washington state's Puget Sound region is paused until 8 April because of the coronavirus pandemic. It is not clear how that would impact potential fixes. At least “several” KC-46A aircraft require repair, says Boeing. “The KC-46 fuel system is equipped with redundant protection for fuel containment,” the company says. “In some cases with this issue, aircraft maintenance crews are finding fuel between the primary and secondary fuel protection barriers within the system.” The company did not immediately respond to a request for more information about how repairs would be done while the production line is shut down. The USAF did not immediately respond to a request for additional information. The KC-46A has been plagued with problems including several category 1 deficiencies. Category 1 deficiencies are defined by the USAF as issues “which may cause death or severe injury; may cause loss or major damage to a weapon system; critically restricts the combat readiness capabilities of the using organisation; or results in a production line stoppage”. The tanker has two other open category 1 deficiencies. Firstly, its boom camera, called the remote vision system, sometimes displays a distorted image. Secondly, its refuelling boom has problems correctly connecting to lighter aircraft, such as the Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt. The boom camera problem is Boeing's fault and is being fixed at its expense. It is to delay the aircraft's entry into service until at least 2023, the USAF has said. The boom connection problem stems from unclear USAF design guidance and is being fixed via a government-funded solution. In December 2019, Boeing resolved another category 1 deficiency where multiple cargo-floor restraint locks malfunctioned and came unlocked. That was first discovered a few months prior in September 2019 and resulted in a temporary ban on cargo or passengers flying in the KC-46A. A hardware retrofit fixed the problem. Delays to the KC-46A's entry into service, combined with a growing need for tankers, has forced the USAF to go looking for alternatives. The service is actively soliciting private companies to provide it with up to 5,000h of annual in-flight refuelling services starting in 2022.",3,390,1.0,0.3446,"test, force, helicopter, fire, system, service, attack, design, usaf, missile","['u', 'force', 'usaf', 'say', 'fuel', 'leak', 'pegasus', 'inflight', 'refuel', 'tanker', 'problem', 'discover', 'july', 'recently', 'upgraded', 'category', 'deficiency', 'say', 'service', 'march', 'force', 'work', 'together', 'determine', 'root', 'cause', 'implement', 'corrective', 'action', 'programme', 'office', 'continue', 'monitor', 'entire', 'fleet', 'enhance', 'acceptance', 'test', 'fuel', 'system', 'identify', 'potential', 'leak', 'factory', 'repair', 'prior', 'delivery', 'say', 'usaf', 'contractually', 'obligate', 'remedy', 'deficiency', 'additional', 'cost', 'production', 'washington', 'state', 'puget', 'sound', 'region', 'pause', 'april', 'coronavirus', 'pandemic', 'clear', 'impact', 'potential', 'fix', 'least', 'several', 'require', 'repair', 'say', 'fuel', 'system', 'equip', 'redundant', 'protection', 'fuel', 'containment', 'say', 'case', 'issue', 'maintenance', 'crew', 'find', 'fuel', 'primary', 'secondary', 'fuel', 'protection', 'barrier', 'within', 'immediately', 'respond', 'request', 'information', 'repair', 'production', 'line', 'shut', 'usaf', 'immediately', 'respond', 'request', 'additional', 'information', 'plague', 'problem', 'include', 'several', 'category', 'deficiency', 'category', 'deficiency', 'define', 'usaf', 'issue', 'may', 'cause', 'death', 'severe', 'injury', 'may', 'cause', 'loss', 'major', 'damage', 'weapon', 'system', 'critically', 'restricts', 'combat', 'readiness', 'capability', 'use', 'organisation', 'result', 'production', 'line', 'stoppage', 'tanker', 'open', 'category', 'deficiency', 'firstly', 'boom', 'camera', 'call', 'remote', 'vision', 'system', 'sometimes', 'display', 'distort', 'image', 'secondly', 'refuel', 'boom', 'problem', 'correctly', 'connect', 'lighter', 'fairchild', 'republic', 'thunderbolt', 'boom', 'camera', 'problem', 'fault', 'fix', 'expense', 'delay', 'entry', 'service', 'least', 'usaf', 'say', 'boom', 'connection', 'problem', 'stem', 'unclear', 'usaf', 'design', 'guidance', 'fix', 'via', 'governmentfunded', 'solution', 'december', 'resolve', 'another', 'category', 'deficiency', 'multiple', 'cargofloor', 'restraint', 'lock', 'malfunction', 'come', 'unlocked', 'discover', 'month', 'prior', 'september', 'result', 'temporary', 'ban', 'cargo', 'passenger', 'fly', 'hardware', 'retrofit', 'fix', 'problem', 'delay', 'entry', 'service', 'combine', 'grow', 'need', 'tanker', 'force', 'usaf', 'go', 'look', 'alternative', 'service', 'actively', 'solicit', 'private', 'provide', 'annual', 'inflight', 'refuel', 'service', 'start']"

"Air Canada says it is cutting 16,500 employees and slashing its network by up to 90% in April and May, confirming earlier reports in Canadian media. “Due to the unprecedented impact of COVID-19 upon its business, the airline will reduce capacity for the second quarter of 2020 by 85%-90% compared to last year's Q2 and will place 15,200 members of its unionised workforce on off duty status, and furlough about 1,300 managers. The workplace reductions will be effective on or about April 3 and are intended to be temporary,” the airline writes in a statement on 30 March. News of the staff reduction, which accounts for more than half the airline's total staff of 30,000, comes two weeks after Canada's largest airline announced it had temporarily laid off 5,100 flight attendants. It is unclear if the 16,500 staff cuts announced on Monday include the 5,100 attendants. ”To furlough such a large proportion of our employees is an extremely painful decision but one we are required to take given our dramatically smaller operations for the next while. It will help ensure that Air Canada can manage through this crisis that is affecting airlines everywhere,” says chief executive Calin Rovinescu. In addition to the staff reducitions, Air Canada will be taking extraordinary measures to protect its liquidity, including cutting salaries of top executives, delaying share buy-backs, drawing down lines of credit and implementing a cost reduction and capital deferral program, the company says. The union representing the airline's flight attendants, the Canadian Union of Public Employees, says it does not have any information regarding ”additional”  layoffs among flight attendants. That could imply that the 5,100 layoffs announced on 20 March are part of the 16,500 mentioned on Monday. This past weekend, Air Canada said it was continuing repatriation flights for Canadians who have been stranded overseas as the coronavirus brought most international air travel to a near-standstill. On 28 March alone, the company says it operated 59 flights carrying 8,500 passengers. Between 27 and 29 March, the company will have brought home about 22,500 passengers on 175 flights form Asia, Europe, Latin America and the United States, the airline says in a statement on 29 March. Earlier this month, Air Canada had said it will draw down most of its network but keep some trans-border and international flights after 1 April “to maintain a number of 'air bridges' to facilitate essential travel and ensure the continued movement of emergency supplies and other vital goods”. The carrier withdrew earnings guidance for 2020 and 2021, and requested government aid to ease financial losses it expects to suffer in the coming months.

"Canadian airlines Air Canada, WestJet, Swoop, Air Transat and Sunwing have been accused of breach of contract in a class-action lawsuit filed in British Columbia for refusing to refund tickets purchased after the coronavirus severely impacted air travel. Instead, the five airlines relaxed usually rigid change rules by granting passengers non-transferrable credits towards future travel, the plaintiffs claim in a filing on 27 March. After the Canadian government advised against non-essential travel in mid-March, the five carriers radically curtailed their schedules and began laying off staff. They have allowed passengers to rebook without charge on dates later in the year when, it is expected, airlines will resume normal schedules. Some travellers, however, are demanding their money back, saying they may not wish to travel even after travel restrictions are lifted. For others, it is a financial burden to have money sitting with airlines rather than available to cover daily living expenses, says the suit, filed by British Columbia resident Janet Donaldson. “Each of the defendants are forcing the class members to forego their fundamental right to a refund and to spend their monies with the same defendant in the future to purchase travel that the class members may not wish to undertake any longer, and likely at a substantially different price,” the lawsuit reads. The suit says airlines are keeping passengers' money while also not incurring costs of operating cancelled flights. Further, the lawsuit says the spread of the coronavirus into a global pandemic, and the ensuing travel restrictions were “outside the passengers control”, thus mandating refunds. The lawsuit could encompass thousands of passengers who hold tickets for travel on the named airlines in the coming months. Calgary-based WestJet, which announced last week it was cutting almost half of its staff, declined to comment on the legal proceedings. The airline is currently operating at about the same size it was in 2003, having cancelled all international operations and reduced its domestic service to just a few routes. It has grounded 120 aircraft, which is about two thirds its fleet. Vacation specialist Air Transat did not wish to comment on the specific lawsuit, but says it believes it is correct in refusing refunds for missed flights due to global events such as the coronavirus crisis. “[These] are extraordinary circumstances, when all airlines and travel companies have been forced to temporarily halt or reduce drastically their operations when government have decided to close their borders. We do support these decisions in the name of public health and the protection of populations, but these, and the situation itself, has placed an extraordinary burden on the industry, which puts its very existence into question,” the airline says on 30 March. “In such a force majeure situation, way beyond our span of control, we do not have to issue a full refund for travels that have not been completed,” the airline adds. ”By issuing a 24-month credit voucher, we believe that we are offering an acceptable solution. We are confident that our clients will be able to travel again in a not-too-remote future, once the crisis is over.” Other airlines named in the suit could not immediately be reached for comment. Sunwing and Air Transat have said they will wind down operations completely and lay off large percentages of their employees as the crisis plays out, while Air Canada is currently also running a skeleton domestic schedule and helping repatriate Canadians overseas who have been stuck in the past weeks. It too has laid off staff to preserve cash. Two weeks ago, Canadian airlines asked their government for assistance in managing through the crisis which has decimated the travel industry and left thousands of aircraft across North America idle.

"The Federal Aviation Administration has eased some flight crew training and medical requirements in light of the coronavirus outbreak. The moves come after groups like Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association (AOPA) and Airlines for America (A4A) urged the FAA to grant regulatory flexibility, saying the pandemic has made complying with some requirements difficult, hazardous and in some cases impossible. The agency on 30 March released a policy update saying that for three months it will not take enforcement action against pilots for the reason of flying with an expired medical certificate.  That change remains effective through 30 June and applies only to pilots whose medical certificates expire between 31 March and 30 June, says the update. “This is because of the burden that COVID-19 places on the US healthcare system, and because these aviation medical examinations increase the risk of transmission of the virus,” says the FAA's notice. AOPA had lobbied the FAA to ease medical certificate requirements, and requirements related to flight instructor certificates. The group has noted that some FAA “designated pilot examiners” have cancelled appointments, flight instructor refresher courses have been cancelled and some testing facilities have closed. The FAA has also agreed to ease some emergency training requirements for pilots and flight attendants through 31 May. For instance, pilots undergoing recurrent or upgrade training will not need to demonstrate the use of “emergency equipment that must be placed on or over the head”, such as oxygen breathing equipment and life jackets, says the FAA's exemption notice, made public on 27 March. The exemption, requested by airline trade group A4A, also allows flight attendants to use “alternative methods” to complete cardiopulmonary resuscitation training as part of recurrent performance drills. The exemption gives crew one year to complete the normal training procedures.

"Iranian investigators have found that a Mahan Air Airbus A310-300 crew mistakenly landed long and overran at Yerevan after failing to check which end of the landing runway was subject to a displaced threshold. The A310, arriving from Tehran on 26 May last year, had been cleared for an ILS DME approach to runway 09. Yerevan's opposite-direction runway 27 had a 1,450m displaced threshold in place, reducing its normal 3,850m length to 2,400m. Despite having access to NOTAMs, terminal information broadcasts, and other information, the Mahan Air crew believed the threshold displacement applied to runway 09. Flight-data recorder information shows that, as the aircraft descended through 660ft above ground, the crew disengaged the autopilot and, at 180ft, deliberately deviated upwards from the glideslope. This deviation was deliberate and intended to extend the distance for flare and touchdown to account for the imagined threshold displacement, says the Iranian Civil Aviation Organisation inquiry. But the misunderstanding meant the aircraft landed just short of the end of the runway, marked by the displaced threshold for runway 27. The captain observed lights marking the runway end and attempted full braking to avoid overrunning, but the jet crossed the boundary and received damage to its main landing-gear tyres as it passed over the lights. After coming to a halt the crew notified tower controllers that they could not carry out the prior instruction to vacate the runway via taxiway B. Investigators state that the crew had been given NOTAM data for Yerevan Zvartnots airport during a briefing and through delivery to the electronic flightbag in the cockpit, but the crew had “not enough time” to review the information. Both pilots were experienced in flying to Yerevan but were preoccupied by matters including a flightpath adjustment for weather. Although they reviewed the NOTAM data, the pilots were “not focused on the runway limitation”, says the inquiry, and a terminal information broadcast advising of the restriction similarly failed to register. The first officer also acknowledged an approach controller's reminder of the threshold displacement as the A310 conducted its descent to runway 09. None of those on board the aircraft (EP-MNV) was injured but the jet needed a tyre change before it could be released for the return flight to Tehran.",3,395,7.0,0.5774,"crew, runway, inquiry, land, approach, accident, investigator, captain, incident, pilot","['iranian', 'investigator', 'found', 'mahan', 'crew', 'mistakenly', 'land', 'long', 'overran', 'yerevan', 'fail', 'check', 'end', 'land', 'runway', 'subject', 'displace', 'threshold', 'arrive', 'tehran', 'may', 'clear', 'il', 'dme', 'approach', 'runway', 'yerevan', 'oppositedirection', 'runway', 'displace', 'threshold', 'place', 'reduce', 'normal', 'length', 'despite', 'access', 'notams', 'terminal', 'information', 'broadcast', 'information', 'mahan', 'crew', 'believe', 'threshold', 'displacement', 'apply', 'runway', 'flightdata', 'recorder', 'information', 'descend', 'ground', 'crew', 'disengage', 'autopilot', 'deliberately', 'deviate', 'upwards', 'glideslope', 'deviation', 'deliberate', 'intend', 'extend', 'distance', 'flare', 'touchdown', 'account', 'imagine', 'threshold', 'displacement', 'say', 'iranian', 'civil', 'organisation', 'inquiry', 'misunderstand', 'meant', 'land', 'short', 'end', 'runway', 'marked', 'displace', 'threshold', 'runway', 'captain', 'observe', 'light', 'mark', 'runway', 'end', 'attempt', 'full', 'brake', 'avoid', 'overrun', 'jet', 'cross', 'boundary', 'receive', 'damage', 'main', 'landinggear', 'tyre', 'pass', 'light', 'come', 'halt', 'crew', 'notify', 'tower', 'controller', 'carry', 'prior', 'instruction', 'vacate', 'runway', 'via', 'taxiway', 'b', 'investigator', 'state', 'crew', 'give', 'notam', 'data', 'yerevan', 'zvartnots', 'airport', 'briefing', 'delivery', 'electronic', 'flightbag', 'cockpit', 'crew', 'enough', 'review', 'information', 'pilot', 'experienced', 'fly', 'yerevan', 'preoccupy', 'matter', 'include', 'flightpath', 'adjustment', 'weather', 'although', 'review', 'notam', 'data', 'pilot', 'focus', 'runway', 'limitation', 'say', 'inquiry', 'terminal', 'information', 'broadcast', 'advise', 'restriction', 'similarly', 'fail', 'register', 'officer', 'acknowledge', 'approach', 'controller', 'reminder', 'threshold', 'displacement', 'conduct', 'descent', 'runway', 'none', 'board', 'epmnv', 'injured', 'jet', 'need', 'tyre', 'change', 'release', 'return', 'tehran']"
"UK budget carrier EasyJet has opted to ground the remainder of its aircraft fleet, after completing hundreds of repatriation flights in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak. It has also reached an agreement to furlough cabin crew for a two-month period from 1 April, paying them through a UK government job-retention scheme. EasyJet had already parked much of its fleet – comprising over 300 Airbus jets – in response to increasingly restrictive measures imposed by governments across Europe. But it had continued operating repatriation and rescue flights and says it has conducted over 650 such services and carried 45,000 passengers. The final flight arrived on 29 March, although it remains prepared to operate more at government request. “At this stage there can be no certainty of the date for restarting commercial flights,” says the budget carrier. “We will continuously evaluate the situation based on regulations and demand, and will update the market when we have a view.” EasyJet says the fleet grounding “removes significant cost” from its operation, and adds that it is continuing to take steps to cut non-essential expenditure from its business. It says its balance sheet is “strong”, with no debt refinancing until 2022, but is holding talks with liquidity providers. “We are working tirelessly to ensure that EasyJet continues to be well positioned to overcome the challenges of coronavirus,” says chief executive Johan Lundgren. EasyJet founder and key shareholder Stelios Haji-Ioannou has, however, recently renewed his criticism of the airline's fleet strategy, insisting that capital expenditure payments to Airbus over the next three years pose a “threat” to the airline's viability. Haji-Ioannou believes the airline needs to cancel its current Airbus order contract with a view to operating a fleet of around 250 rather than 350 aircraft.

"An IAI Westwind 1124A private jet operating a medical evacuation flight from Manila Ninoy Aquino International Airport to Tokyo Haneda crashed during takeoff, killing all eight aboard. The Manila International Airport Authority (MIAA) confirms that the crash happened at 19:57 local time on 29 March as the aircraft (RP-C5880) attempted to take off from runway 24. “Just before taking off, the aircraft, a Westwind 1124A business jet, suddenly burst into flames and stopped just meters before the end of the runway,” says MIAA. “Seeing the incident, the Manila Control Tower immediately dispatched the MIAA Fire and Rescue team to the site and were able to put out the fire of the burning plane. However, all passengers and crew perished even before the fire was put out.” The crash forced the runway to close for the night while the debris was cleared. It re-opened at 0420. The cockpit voice recorder of the crashed jet has been recovered. According to the MIAA, the aircraft was carrying three flight crew, three medical personnel, and two patients, one of whom was American, the other Canadian. Cirium fleets data show that RP-C5880 was originally delivered in November 1981 and served with several corporate customers over its 40-year service life. In 2009 it was obtained by Philippine charter carrier Lionair, which is not related to Indonesian low cost carrier Lion Air.  While Lionair remained the aircraft's owner, its operator is listed as Executive Jets Asia. During the investigation, Philippine authorities have grounded Lionair's fleet. “Tthe Flight Safety Investigation Committee (FSIC) will look into if there are aviation safety procedures violated by the aircraft operator and/or the crew,” adds CAAP.",3,397,7.0,0.1385,"crew, runway, inquiry, land, approach, accident, investigator, captain, incident, pilot","['iai', 'westwind', 'private', 'jet', 'operating', 'medical', 'evacuation', 'manila', 'ninoy', 'aquino', 'international', 'airport', 'tokyo', 'haneda', 'crashed', 'takeoff', 'kill', 'aboard', 'manila', 'international', 'airport', 'authority', 'miaa', 'confirms', 'crash', 'happen', 'local', 'march', 'attempt', 'take', 'runway', 'take', 'westwind', 'business', 'jet', 'suddenly', 'burst', 'flame', 'stop', 'meter', 'end', 'runway', 'say', 'miaa', 'see', 'incident', 'manila', 'control', 'tower', 'immediately', 'dispatch', 'miaa', 'fire', 'rescue', 'team', 'site', 'able', 'put', 'fire', 'burning', 'plane', 'however', 'passenger', 'crew', 'perish', 'even', 'fire', 'put', 'crash', 'force', 'runway', 'close', 'night', 'debris', 'clear', 'reopen', 'cockpit', 'voice', 'recorder', 'crashed', 'jet', 'recover', 'accord', 'miaa', 'carry', 'crew', 'medical', 'personnel', 'patient', 'american', 'canadian', 'fleet', 'data', 'originally', 'deliver', 'november', 'serve', 'several', 'corporate', 'customer', 'service', 'life', 'obtain', 'philippine', 'charter', 'carrier', 'lionair', 'related', 'indonesian', 'low', 'cost', 'carrier', 'lion', 'lionair', 'remain', 'owner', 'operator', 'list', 'executive', 'jet', 'asia', 'investigation', 'philippine', 'authority', 'ground', 'lionair', 'fleet', 'tthe', 'safety', 'investigation', 'committee', 'fsic', 'look', 'safety', 'procedure', 'violate', 'operator', 'crew', 'add', 'caap']"
"Qantas long-haul pilots have voted in favour of a deal on pay and conditions for Project Sunrise flights. The deal means existing Qantas long-haul pilots will fly Airbus A350s if an order is made for the ultra-long-haul project, Australia's biggest airline says in a statement. Project Sunrise is the airline's initiative to open nonstop services to the Australian east coast from New York and London from around 2022-23. The carrier had threatened to bypass unions in February, saying that it would negotiate directly with individual pilots or create a “new employment entity”, if it could not come to an agreement with the Australian and International Pilots Association (AIPA). Qantas said today that over 1,400 pilots voted on the deal, with 85% in favour. “The vote came at a difficult time but it's also important to keep looking ahead,” Qantas chief pilot Dick Tobiano states. Qantas has placed tentative orders for up to a dozen A350-1000s for Project Sunrise. Airbus has also agreed to extend the deadline for a decision on the order so both parties can cope with the coronavirus crisis, Tobiano says. “But when this period has passed, and it will, we will refocus our attention on Project Sunrise and the A350 order,” he promises.",3,398,8.0,0.2025,"government, uk, carrier, business, state, share, south, airway, financial, plan","['qantas', 'longhaul', 'pilot', 'vote', 'favour', 'deal', 'pay', 'condition', 'project', 'sunrise', 'deal', 'mean', 'exist', 'qantas', 'longhaul', 'pilot', 'fly', 'order', 'make', 'ultralonghaul', 'project', 'australia', 'big', 'say', 'statement', 'project', 'sunrise', 'initiative', 'open', 'nonstop', 'service', 'australian', 'east', 'coast', 'york', 'london', 'around', 'carrier', 'threaten', 'bypass', 'union', 'february', 'say', 'negotiate', 'directly', 'individual', 'pilot', 'create', 'employment', 'entity', 'come', 'agreement', 'australian', 'international', 'pilot', 'association', 'aipa', 'qantas', 'say', 'today', 'pilot', 'vote', 'deal', 'favour', 'vote', 'come', 'difficult', 'important', 'keep', 'look', 'ahead', 'qantas', 'chief', 'pilot', 'dick', 'tobiano', 'state', 'qantas', 'place', 'tentative', 'order', 'dozen', 'project', 'sunrise', 'agree', 'extend', 'deadline', 'decision', 'order', 'party', 'cope', 'coronavirus', 'crisis', 'tobiano', 'say', 'period', 'pass', 'refocus', 'attention', 'project', 'sunrise', 'order', 'promise']"
"Lynn Tilton has resigned as chief executive of MD Helicopters after a bankruptcy court orderer that she sell the aircraft manufacturer to repay debts to her holding company Patriarch Partners. Patriarch Partners defaulted on $1.7 billion in loans owed to financier Zohar, according to a report inThe Wall Street Journal. Zohar sued the company to force it to sell off its businesses, including MD Helicopters, to repay the debt. MD Helicopters confirmed Tilton's resignation to FlightGlobal. Facing a bankruptcy court order to sell businesses, Tilton allegedly walked away and abruptly resigned from her position as CEO, say Zohar's lawyers. “Ms Tilton abandoned them on Saturday (21 March) without any notice,” says Michael Nestor, an attorney for Zohar, to theJournal. Zohar's lawyers did not respond to a request for comment. MD Helicopters disputes the claim that Tilton abandoned the company. It says she resigned on Monday, 23 March 2020. Patriarch Partners did not respond to a request for comment. ”Ms. Tilton resigned only after it became clear that the [Patriarch Partners] portfolio companies, of which [MD Helicopters] is one, were being adversely impacted by the Zohar disputes, and the Zohars refused to grant the portfolio companies adequate loan extensions,” says MD Helicopters. ”Ms. Tilton has pledged to reasonably cooperate with the Zohar Funds to transition control of the portfolio companies. Contrary to the Zohar funds' contentions, Ms. Tilton at no time “abandoned” the companies.” In addition to MD Helicopters, Patriarch Partners owned a mixture of 21 industrial, software, cosmetics, household goods and lifestyle businesses, including mapping company Rand McNally and metal foundry Vulcan Engineering. MD Helicopters says Tilton still has ownership stakes in those companies. ”Lynn remains in her director position with MD Helicopters,” says the manufacturer. ”In addition, Ms. Tilton remains a large secured lender to, and shareholder of [MD Helicopters]  and many of the portfolio companies, and continues to have rights in connection with those investments.” The company will be led by its ”existing senior leadership team”, says MD Helicopters. “Ms. Tilton worked with the company management team to prepare for a smooth transition, including to prepare for any business disruptions that may be caused by the COVID-19 crisis,” says the firm. MD Helicopters of Mesa, Arizona is a spinoff of Boeing's 1997 merger with McDonnell Douglas. The company was originally founded by Howard Hughes and was a part of Hughes Aircraft before being bought by McDonnell Douglas in 1984. The company makes light helicopters for military, police and emergency services. Its Armed MD 530 was sold as a scouting and light attack helicopter to Afghanistan, Kenya and Lebanon in recent years. The single-engined MD 530 is based on the Vietnam War-era Hughes OH-6 Cayuse. Boeing makes a similar light attack, scouting and utility helicopter for US special forces called the AH-6 Little Bird. That helicopter is also based on the OH-6. MD Helicopters disputed Boeing's right to sell the AH-6 Little Bird. The two companies had a long-running legal dispute. Ultimately, MD Helicopters lost its argument in an arbitration case decided in February 2020 in which it was ordered to pay Boeing $11.6 million. Despite losing its chief executive and being caught in a bankruptcy fight, MD Helicopters says it is a ”viable, thriving, promising businesses”. MD is fully executing all of its military and commercial contracts as well as supporting worldwide operations through its global network of field service personnel and authorised sales, service and distribution partners”, the company says.

"UK air navigation service NATS has illustrated the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on the country's air traffic through a comparison with airspace activity a year ago. It has visualised aircraft movements on 25 March 2020, when 1,415 flights were handled, against the 6,224 flights on same date in 2019. NATS chief executive Martin Rolfe says the crisis has reduced UK air traffic volumes by 77%, with the decline higher in other European countries such as Germany, France and Spain. “It seems certain that the UK's numbers will fall further as repatriation flights end,” he adds. “There remains great uncertainty around the medium- and long-term impact all this will have on the global aviation industry and its ability to recover once the crisis has passed.” Rolfe points out that NATS is taking measures to protect air traffic personnel. He adds that ensuring controller licences remain valid during the downturn is a “concern” and that this situation is being discussed with the Civil Aviation Authority.",3,400,2.0,0.159,"executive, chief, cut, add, situation, staff, crisis, make, coronavirus, employee","['uk', 'navigation', 'service', 'nats', 'illustrate', 'impact', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'country', 'traffic', 'comparison', 'airspace', 'activity', 'ago', 'visualise', 'movement', 'march', 'handle', 'date', 'nats', 'chief', 'executive', 'martin', 'rolfe', 'say', 'crisis', 'reduce', 'uk', 'traffic', 'volume', 'decline', 'high', 'european', 'country', 'germany', 'france', 'spain', 'seem', 'certain', 'uk', 'number', 'fall', 'far', 'repatriation', 'end', 'add', 'remains', 'great', 'uncertainty', 'around', 'medium', 'longterm', 'impact', 'global', 'industry', 'ability', 'recover', 'crisis', 'rolfe', 'point', 'nats', 'take', 'measure', 'protect', 'traffic', 'personnel', 'add', 'ensure', 'controller', 'licence', 'remain', 'valid', 'downturn', 'concern', 'situation', 'discuss', 'civil', 'authority']"
"UK ground-handling firms have collectively urged the government to take measures to help them preserve cash and maintain their workforce, warning that they will otherwise be unlikely to maintain operations through the coronavirus crisis period. In a letter to UK chancellor Rishi Sunak and transport secretary Grant Shapps, four major handling companies – Swissport, Dnata, Menzies and WFS – are seeking “urgent dialogue” to obtain support. The four companies represent 90% of handling services for passenger and cargo flights at UK airports, with a collective workforce of 25,000 in the country. Retention of staff is crucial, they argue, because of the time needed to hire and train new personnel. “Without our services and these dedicated teams, the airport infrastructure in the UK would grind to a halt for up to four months,” they write. “It would take even longer to fully recover once the initial crisis is over.” Coronavirus disruption risks an “artificial cash-flow crisis”, they state, posing a “very real threat” to survival of “ordinarily healthy businesses”. “Our industry operates a low-margin model. We are generally paid on a per-service basis or tonnage, so where flights are grounded, our provision is cancelled and our revenue is cut off,” they point out. Menzies disclosed on 27 March that it was putting more than half its global workforce on temporary leave. Routine decisions, they warn, such as the purchase of de-icing fluid ahead of forecast cold weather, are becoming “harder to make”. The handlers have asked the government to consider national insurance and tax breaks, removal of business rates, access to emergency funding, and provision of guarantees to lenders in order for them to continue funding the aviation industry. “Without urgent government support we are unlikely to be able to continue our operations across the country throughout the crisis period,” they write, adding that handlers have not been included in government discussions over the aviation sector. “The more staff we lay off, the greater the challenge we will face in servicing the bounce-back and corresponding national economic recovery once [this] crisis is over.”",3,401,2.0,0.1998,"executive, chief, cut, add, situation, staff, crisis, make, coronavirus, employee","['uk', 'groundhandling', 'firm', 'collectively', 'urge', 'government', 'take', 'measure', 'help', 'preserve', 'cash', 'maintain', 'workforce', 'warn', 'otherwise', 'unlikely', 'maintain', 'operation', 'coronavirus', 'crisis', 'period', 'letter', 'uk', 'chancellor', 'rishi', 'sunak', 'transport', 'secretary', 'grant', 'shapps', 'major', 'handle', 'swissport', 'dnata', 'menzies', 'wfs', 'seek', 'urgent', 'dialogue', 'obtain', 'support', 'represent', 'handle', 'service', 'passenger', 'cargo', 'uk', 'airport', 'collective', 'workforce', 'country', 'retention', 'staff', 'crucial', 'argue', 'need', 'hire', 'train', 'personnel', 'without', 'service', 'dedicate', 'team', 'airport', 'infrastructure', 'uk', 'grind', 'halt', 'month', 'write', 'take', 'even', 'longer', 'fully', 'recover', 'initial', 'crisis', 'coronavirus', 'disruption', 'risk', 'artificial', 'cashflow', 'crisis', 'state', 'pose', 'real', 'threat', 'survival', 'ordinarily', 'healthy', 'business', 'industry', 'operates', 'lowmargin', 'model', 'generally', 'paid', 'perservice', 'basis', 'tonnage', 'ground', 'provision', 'cancel', 'revenue', 'cut', 'point', 'menzies', 'disclose', 'march', 'put', 'half', 'global', 'workforce', 'temporary', 'leave', 'routine', 'decision', 'warn', 'purchase', 'deice', 'fluid', 'ahead', 'forecast', 'cold', 'weather', 'become', 'harder', 'make', 'handler', 'ask', 'government', 'consider', 'national', 'insurance', 'tax', 'break', 'removal', 'business', 'rate', 'access', 'emergency', 'funding', 'provision', 'guarantee', 'lender', 'order', 'continue', 'funding', 'industry', 'without', 'urgent', 'government', 'support', 'unlikely', 'able', 'continue', 'operation', 'across', 'country', 'throughout', 'crisis', 'period', 'write', 'add', 'handler', 'include', 'government', 'discussion', 'sector', 'staff', 'lay', 'great', 'challenge', 'face', 'service', 'bounceback', 'correspond', 'national', 'economic', 'recovery', 'crisis']"
"French investigators have highlighted the part played by language differences during a serious conflict incident in which a landing Hop Bombardier CRJ700 was cleared to cross a runway while an EasyJet Airbus A319 was taking off. The A319 had been cleared, in English, to take off from Lyon's runway 35L but the air traffic controller, in French, subsequently cleared the arriving CRJ700 – simultaneously landing on the parallel 35R – to cross 35L via the B4 exit. Investigation authority BEA states that the controller, during his shift, had been routinely clearing landing aircraft to cross 35L, owing to low departure activity on the parallel runway, and that the repetition of tasks had become “somewhat automatic”. BEA says he issued the CRJ700 clearance “without detecting the conflict”, not noticing the departing A319 during an external visual scan. It adds that the flight-strip processes in place could mask potential conflicts. But the inquiry also suggests the language difference increased the risk of an accident. The EasyJet crew, it says, “did not understand” the crossing clearance, in French, given to the Hop crew. “Use of multiple languages in communications with crews can decrease situational awareness of the crews of surrounding traffic,” it states in its conclusions over the 17 March 2017 event. The Hop crew was based in Lyon and already aware of the possibility of runway incursion, and the pilots checked runway 35L before the crossing. Another visual scan, at the same time, resulted in the controller's noticing the conflict. BEA says the Hop aircraft subsequently stopped at a holding point before entering the runway.",3,402,7.0,0.5091,"crew, runway, inquiry, land, approach, accident, investigator, captain, incident, pilot","['french', 'investigator', 'highlight', 'part', 'played', 'language', 'difference', 'serious', 'conflict', 'incident', 'land', 'hop', 'bombardier', 'clear', 'cross', 'runway', 'easyjet', 'take', 'clear', 'english', 'take', 'lyon', 'runway', 'traffic', 'controller', 'french', 'subsequently', 'clear', 'arrive', 'simultaneously', 'land', 'parallel', 'cross', 'via', 'exit', 'investigation', 'authority', 'bea', 'state', 'controller', 'shift', 'routinely', 'clearing', 'land', 'cross', 'owe', 'low', 'departure', 'activity', 'parallel', 'runway', 'repetition', 'task', 'become', 'somewhat', 'automatic', 'bea', 'say', 'issue', 'clearance', 'without', 'detect', 'conflict', 'notice', 'depart', 'external', 'visual', 'scan', 'add', 'flightstrip', 'process', 'place', 'mask', 'potential', 'conflict', 'inquiry', 'suggests', 'language', 'difference', 'increase', 'risk', 'accident', 'easyjet', 'crew', 'say', 'understand', 'cross', 'clearance', 'french', 'give', 'hop', 'crew', 'use', 'multiple', 'language', 'communication', 'crew', 'decrease', 'situational', 'awareness', 'crew', 'surround', 'traffic', 'state', 'conclusion', 'march', 'event', 'hop', 'crew', 'base', 'lyon', 'already', 'aware', 'possibility', 'runway', 'incursion', 'pilot', 'checked', 'runway', 'cross', 'another', 'visual', 'scan', 'result', 'controller', 'notice', 'conflict', 'bea', 'say', 'hop', 'subsequently', 'stop', 'hold', 'point', 'enter', 'runway']"
"United Airlines has agreed to borrow $500 million from Goldman Sachs Bank USA in the form of a one-year secured term loan. The Chicago-headquartered carrier will use the loan for related transaction costs, fees and expenses, and for working capital and other general corporate purposes. It has pledged some of its spare parts as collateral for the loan. The loan has a variable interest rate equal to Libor plus a margin of 2.75%, 3%, 3.25% or 3.5% per annum. Alternatively, United can choose “another rate based on certain market interest rates”, plus a margin of 1.75%, 2%, 2.25% or 2.5% per annum. In each of these cases, the incremental increases to the margin will occur at 90 days, 180 days and 270 days. The deal was agreed on 20 March and United drew down the loan in two separate disbursements on 23 March and 24 March. United must pay back the principal amount of the term loan in a single installment on the maturity date, which falls on 22 March 2021. United may prepay all or a portion of the term loan from time to time, at par plus accrued and unpaid interest. US carriers are suffering as the coronavirus spreads throughout the country, with over 85,000 confirmed cases and 1,296 deaths, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Earlier this week, United stepped back plans to cut 95% of capacity and leave just a skeleton network in place through the coronavirus crisis. It has now reinstated some daily international routes to Europe, Asia and Australia, while running a few additional flights between now and the end of March to repatriate displaced travellers.

"Preliminary traffic figures from the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines show that regional air traffic plunged in February. Owing to the coronavirus outbreak, regional airlines experienced a 43.9% year-on-year collapse to 17 million passengers during the month. RPKs fell 34.8% and available seats fell 20.6%. Load factors fell 14.4 percentage points to 66.6%. “Asian airlines saw passenger demand for international air travel demand plunge in February as a result of the rapid spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic,” says outgoing AAPA director general Andrew Herdman. “Overall, for the first two months of the year, the number of international passengers travelling on Asian airlines fell by 21% to 50 million passengers.” AAPA noted one relative bright spot, in that demand for air cargo fell just 5%. Offered freight capacity during the month decline 13.5%, however, owing to a shortage of bellyhold capacity. This resulted in February's average international freight load factors growing 6.5 percentage points to 60.3%. “The COVID-19 pandemic has posed unprecedented challenges, both operational and financial, to the airline industry and the wider travel and tourism sector worldwide,” says Herdman. “Whilst some governments have moved quickly to provide measures of financial support, much more needs to be done to reduce the risks of permanent damage to critical sectors of the economy.” The AAPA's members comprise Air Astana, All Nippon Airways, Asiana Airlines, Bangkok Airways, Cathay Pacific Airways, China Airlines, EVA Air, Garuda Indonesia, Japan Airlines, Korean Air, Malaysia Airlines, Philippine Airlines, Royal Brunei Airlines, Singapore Airlines, and Thai Airways International.",3,404,3.0,0.2881,"passenger, loss, operating, revenue, traffic, month, increase, capacity, decline, result","['preliminary', 'traffic', 'figure', 'association', 'asia', 'pacific', 'regional', 'traffic', 'plunge', 'february', 'owe', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'regional', 'experienced', 'yearonyear', 'collapse', 'passenger', 'month', 'rpks', 'fell', 'available', 'seat', 'fell', 'load', 'factor', 'fell', 'percentage', 'point', 'asian', 'saw', 'passenger', 'demand', 'international', 'travel', 'demand', 'plunge', 'february', 'result', 'rapid', 'spread', 'coronavirus', 'coronavirus', 'pandemic', 'say', 'outgo', 'aapa', 'director', 'general', 'andrew', 'herdman', 'overall', 'month', 'number', 'international', 'passenger', 'travel', 'asian', 'fell', 'aapa', 'note', 'relative', 'bright', 'spot', 'demand', 'cargo', 'fell', 'offer', 'freight', 'capacity', 'month', 'decline', 'however', 'owe', 'shortage', 'bellyhold', 'capacity', 'result', 'february', 'average', 'international', 'freight', 'load', 'factor', 'grow', 'percentage', 'point', 'coronavirus', 'pandemic', 'pose', 'unprecedented', 'challenge', 'operational', 'financial', 'industry', 'wider', 'travel', 'tourism', 'sector', 'worldwide', 'say', 'herdman', 'whilst', 'government', 'move', 'quickly', 'provide', 'measure', 'financial', 'support', 'much', 'need', 'reduce', 'risk', 'permanent', 'damage', 'critical', 'sector', 'aapa', 'member', 'comprise', 'astana', 'nippon', 'airway', 'asiana', 'bangkok', 'airway', 'cathay', 'pacific', 'airway', 'eva', 'garuda', 'indonesia', 'japan', 'korean', 'malaysia', 'philippine', 'royal', 'brunei', 'singapore', 'thai', 'airway', 'international']"
"European air traffic data shows that the coronavirus outbreak has effectively set the continent's airspace back by more than a quarter of a century, to flight levels not experienced since the early 1990s. Statistics from pan-European air navigation organisation have already shown that daily flight totals have more than halved, and analysis of its data from 30 airports reflects the impact of the outbreak as it swept across the region over a two-week period. Italy's Milan Malpensa and Rome were the first to record a halving of traffic over 9-11 March, with a lag of about a week before major airports in Germany, Spain, France and Scandinavia experienced declines of the same magnitude around 17-19 March. At the tail end of the wave were airports at European extremities, including those in the UK and Ireland as well as Greece and Turkey. Paris Orly airport is scheduled to close to commercial flights on 31 March, with all services transferred to Paris Charles de Gaulle. Restrictions have gradually intensified at the Orly, including closure of a runway and limitations on navigation and landing aids, while a – somewhat redundant – NOTAM prohibited Airbus A380 operations at the airport from 25 March. Orly's operator, Paris Aeroports, states that three of the four terminals will close from 26 March until further notice, and all flights will be “reassigned” to Charles de Gaulle at the end of the month. Eurocontrol statistics show that, of the 30 airports analysed, Orly recorded the largest traffic impact on 25 March – down nearly 95% on the same period last year. Orly is heavily dependent on budget carriers such as Transavia, EasyJet and Vueling, all affected by operational suspensions. Paris Charles de Gaulle and Amsterdam, the twin hubs of Air France-KLM, are among the relatively less-affected of the 30 airports, with losses of around 77-78%. Lufthansa Group airports, in contrast, have been among those impacted most severely, with Munich, Vienna, Geneva and Dusseldorf all showing declines of over 90%, although Frankfurt – again, the primary hub – has fared better at 80%. Although Italy has been the focal point for the coronavirus outbreak in Europe, the traffic fall appears to have stabilised at around 85% for Rome and a couple of points higher for Milan Malpensa, with a similar respective situation at Madrid at Barcelona. London Heathrow and Dublin are among the least-affected airports, with British Airways and, in particular, Aer Lingus showing notably lower levels of disruption than airline counterparts in Germany, France, Italy and Spain.",3,405,4.0,0.3647,"airport, fleet, service, data, carrier, operation, passenger, number, operate, operator","['european', 'traffic', 'data', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'effectively', 'set', 'continent', 'airspace', 'back', 'quarter', 'century', 'level', 'experienced', 'since', 'early', 'statistic', 'paneuropean', 'navigation', 'organisation', 'already', 'daily', 'total', 'halve', 'analysis', 'data', 'airport', 'reflect', 'impact', 'outbreak', 'swept', 'across', 'region', 'twoweek', 'period', 'italy', 'milan', 'malpensa', 'rome', 'record', 'halve', 'traffic', 'march', 'lag', 'week', 'major', 'airport', 'germany', 'spain', 'france', 'scandinavia', 'experienced', 'decline', 'magnitude', 'around', 'march', 'tail', 'end', 'wave', 'airport', 'european', 'extremity', 'include', 'uk', 'ireland', 'well', 'greece', 'turkey', 'paris', 'orly', 'airport', 'schedule', 'close', 'commercial', 'march', 'service', 'transfer', 'paris', 'charles', 'de', 'gaulle', 'restriction', 'gradually', 'intensified', 'orly', 'include', 'closure', 'runway', 'limitation', 'navigation', 'land', 'aid', 'somewhat', 'redundant', 'notam', 'prohibit', 'operation', 'airport', 'march', 'orly', 'operator', 'paris', 'aeroports', 'state', 'terminal', 'close', 'march', 'far', 'notice', 'reassign', 'charles', 'de', 'gaulle', 'end', 'month', 'eurocontrol', 'statistic', 'airport', 'analyse', 'orly', 'record', 'large', 'traffic', 'impact', 'march', 'nearly', 'period', 'orly', 'heavily', 'dependent', 'budget', 'carrier', 'transavia', 'easyjet', 'vueling', 'affected', 'operational', 'suspension', 'paris', 'charles', 'de', 'gaulle', 'amsterdam', 'twin', 'hub', 'franceklm', 'among', 'relatively', 'lessaffected', 'airport', 'loss', 'around', 'lufthansa', 'airport', 'contrast', 'among', 'impact', 'severely', 'munich', 'vienna', 'geneva', 'dusseldorf', 'decline', 'although', 'frankfurt', 'primary', 'hub', 'fare', 'well', 'although', 'italy', 'focal', 'point', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'europe', 'traffic', 'fall', 'appear', 'stabilise', 'around', 'rome', 'couple', 'point', 'high', 'milan', 'malpensa', 'similar', 'respective', 'situation', 'madrid', 'barcelona', 'london', 'heathrow', 'dublin', 'among', 'leastaffected', 'airport', 'british', 'airway', 'particular', 'aer', 'lingus', 'notably', 'low', 'level', 'disruption', 'counterpart', 'germany', 'france', 'italy', 'spain']"
"The cost of purchasing jet kerosene is continuing to fall despite a slight uptick in crude prices, as demand from airlines dries up completely in some regions.

Similar price declines were seen in Asian and North American markets. “European spot jet kerosene prices were seen nearing the lows of 2002 this week with differentials falling further as airlines continue to curb flights, which is pressuring global jet-fuel demand,” notes ICIS – a corporate sibling to Cirium within RELX – in a weekly report dated 24 March. “Absence of significant trades signalled bearishness in the market further exacerbated by almost no bids and offers for most days in the barges market, while offers outpacing bids in the cargoes market [were] seen during open-market trading window,” it adds. With storage space for jet fuel limited, the idea of using tankers to hold unsold kerosene – common practice for some crude products – was dismissed because the quality deteriorates when stored for long periods. ICIS also reports that some refiners are starting to blend their jet fuel into diesel to reduce the excess supply, while others are planning to bring forward refinery maintenance that will reduce their throughput. Because demand has collapsed worldwide, there is little opportunity for traders to take advantage of price arbitrages by shipping jet fuel between regions. “Even when [travel] restrictions are lifted, the market is likely to remain depressed well into the second half of 2020 due to oversupply,” ICIS highlights. “Oversupply growth is expected to be contained by refinery run cuts and shutdowns to some degree.”",3,406,9.0,0.3735,"industry, crisis, demand, coronavirus, global, iata, market, level, cargo, expect","['cost', 'purchasing', 'jet', 'kerosene', 'continue', 'fall', 'despite', 'slight', 'uptick', 'crude', 'price', 'demand', 'dry', 'completely', 'region', 'energy', 'information', 'provider', 'icis', 'ass', 'price', 'jet', 'kerosene', 'delivery', 'northwest', 'europe', 'per', 'tonne', 'around', 'start', 'similar', 'price', 'decline', 'see', 'asian', 'north', 'american', 'market', 'european', 'spot', 'jet', 'kerosene', 'price', 'see', 'near', 'low', 'week', 'differential', 'fall', 'far', 'continue', 'curb', 'pressure', 'global', 'jetfuel', 'demand', 'note', 'icis', 'corporate', 'sibling', 'within', 'relx', 'weekly', 'report', 'date', 'march', 'absence', 'significant', 'trade', 'signal', 'bearishness', 'market', 'far', 'exacerbate', 'almost', 'bid', 'offer', 'day', 'barge', 'market', 'offer', 'outpace', 'bid', 'cargo', 'market', 'see', 'openmarket', 'trading', 'window', 'add', 'storage', 'space', 'jet', 'fuel', 'limited', 'idea', 'use', 'tanker', 'hold', 'unsold', 'kerosene', 'common', 'practice', 'crude', 'product', 'dismiss', 'quality', 'deteriorates', 'store', 'long', 'period', 'icis', 'report', 'refiner', 'start', 'blend', 'jet', 'fuel', 'diesel', 'reduce', 'excess', 'supply', 'others', 'planning', 'bring', 'forward', 'refinery', 'maintenance', 'reduce', 'throughput', 'demand', 'collapse', 'worldwide', 'little', 'opportunity', 'trader', 'take', 'advantage', 'price', 'arbitrage', 'shipping', 'jet', 'fuel', 'region', 'even', 'travel', 'restriction', 'lift', 'market', 'likely', 'remain', 'depressed', 'well', 'second', 'half', 'due', 'oversupply', 'icis', 'highlight', 'oversupply', 'growth', 'expect', 'contain', 'refinery', 'run', 'cut', 'shutdown', 'degree']"
"Business aviation may be better prepared the downturn caused by the Covid-19 pandemic than it was for the 2008 financial crisis, according to analyst Brian Foley. In a report issued on 25 March, he said that in a matter of days the industry has moved from optimism over a promising start to the year “to a state of bewilderment, uncertainty and anxiety”. While it is difficult to predict how business jet sales and usage will fare over the coming months “based on the recent avalanche of negative financial news”, Foley says “the industry is arguably in better shape to weather this downturn than it was going into the pummelling 2007-2008 financial crisis”. Foley attributes this optimism to the strength of the US market, which he describes as “the epicentre of business aviation”, with 63% of the worldwide fleet based in the country – equivalent to around 14,200 “active jets”. Before the coronavirus outbreak, US stock markets had been at ”all-time highs that were 67% above 2007 levels, with quarterly corporate profits around a third higher”, he notes. Manufacturing was improving, job growth strong, consumer strength was “meaningful” and business investment healthy. “The most important economy to the industry was clearly in better shape before this downturn than it was in the last crisis,” he says. Added to this, reforms to the financial system following the financial crisis have required banks to hold greater reserves and to adopt tighter lending standards, providing added liquidity and reduced credit risk. “For those who need to finance or lease a jet, rates are significantly lower than they were back then,” he adds. While the business jet manufacturers' backlogs are smaller than in the late 2000s, they are not “stacked” with as many speculators: “Some manufacturers put added teeth in their contracts since the last downturn, aimed to keep airplane flippers out of their books,” he says. While there will inevitably be some cancellations and deferrals during this crisis, he notes, “the current order books are stickier”. Year-on-year business jet deliveries climbed by a “solid” 15% in 2019, after a being “essentially flat” over the past decade. Much of the increase was due to the introduction of new aircraft, he notes, “which tend to stir up sales, and will do so into the future”. There are admittedly some “weaknesses” in 2020 compared with the previous crisis, notably international markets such as China, the Middle East and Russia, will not provide the ”safety net” for the industry they once did, due to their fragile economies. “As it was in 2007, the new jet market is still oversupplied with too many models chasing a finite number of buyers,” Foley notes. However, he believes few in the in business aviation community will escape the “impending downdraft” of the Covid-19 crisis. New and pre-owned sales will all be impacted as buyers wait for some semblance of normality to return. Reduced business jet utilisation will ultimately impact fuel sales and maintenance activity, which in turn will hit the fixed-base operator and MRO markets. While there has been a recent spike in charter activity, driven largely by a demand for repatriation flights, that too will taper off, says Foley, as fewer onsite meetings occur. “The industry will undeniably be impacted after 10 years of relatively clear sailing,” Foley says. While business aviation is a cyclical business, “the speed and intensity” of the Covid-19 outbreak has caught many in the industry off-guard. “Although there will be casualties, the majority of players have been here before and are survivors, having adapted their businesses to swings in the past,” says Foley.",3,407,9.0,0.2865,"industry, crisis, demand, coronavirus, global, iata, market, level, cargo, expect","['business', 'may', 'well', 'prepared', 'downturn', 'cause', 'coronavirus', 'pandemic', 'financial', 'crisis', 'accord', 'analyst', 'brian', 'foley', 'report', 'issue', 'march', 'say', 'matter', 'day', 'industry', 'move', 'optimism', 'promising', 'start', 'state', 'bewilderment', 'uncertainty', 'anxiety', 'difficult', 'predict', 'business', 'jet', 'sale', 'usage', 'fare', 'come', 'month', 'base', 'recent', 'avalanche', 'negative', 'financial', 'news', 'foley', 'say', 'industry', 'arguably', 'well', 'shape', 'weather', 'downturn', 'go', 'pummel', 'financial', 'crisis', 'foley', 'attribute', 'optimism', 'strength', 'u', 'market', 'describes', 'epicentre', 'business', 'worldwide', 'fleet', 'base', 'country', 'equivalent', 'around', 'active', 'jet', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'u', 'stock', 'market', 'alltime', 'high', 'level', 'quarterly', 'corporate', 'profit', 'around', 'third', 'high', 'note', 'manufacturing', 'improve', 'job', 'growth', 'strong', 'consumer', 'strength', 'meaningful', 'business', 'investment', 'healthy', 'important', 'economy', 'industry', 'clearly', 'well', 'shape', 'downturn', 'crisis', 'say', 'add', 'reform', 'financial', 'system', 'follow', 'financial', 'crisis', 'require', 'bank', 'hold', 'great', 'reserve', 'adopt', 'tighter', 'lending', 'standard', 'provide', 'add', 'liquidity', 'reduce', 'credit', 'risk', 'need', 'finance', 'lease', 'jet', 'rate', 'significantly', 'low', 'back', 'add', 'business', 'jet', 'manufacturer', 'backlog', 'small', 'late', 'stack', 'many', 'speculator', 'manufacturer', 'put', 'add', 'teeth', 'contract', 'since', 'downturn', 'aim', 'keep', 'airplane', 'flipper', 'book', 'say', 'inevitably', 'cancellation', 'deferral', 'crisis', 'note', 'current', 'order', 'book', 'stickier', 'yearonyear', 'business', 'jet', 'delivery', 'climbed', 'solid', 'essentially', 'flat', 'past', 'decade', 'much', 'increase', 'due', 'introduction', 'note', 'tend', 'stir', 'sale', 'future', 'admittedly', 'weakness', 'compare', 'previous', 'crisis', 'notably', 'international', 'market', 'middle', 'east', 'russia', 'provide', 'safety', 'net', 'industry', 'due', 'fragile', 'economy', 'jet', 'market', 'still', 'oversupplied', 'many', 'model', 'chase', 'finite', 'number', 'buyer', 'foley', 'note', 'however', 'believe', 'business', 'community', 'escape', 'impend', 'downdraft', 'coronavirus', 'crisis', 'preowned', 'sale', 'impact', 'buyer', 'wait', 'semblance', 'normality', 'return', 'reduce', 'business', 'jet', 'utilisation', 'ultimately', 'impact', 'fuel', 'sale', 'maintenance', 'activity', 'turn', 'hit', 'fixedbase', 'operator', 'mro', 'market', 'recent', 'spike', 'charter', 'activity', 'driven', 'largely', 'demand', 'repatriation', 'taper', 'say', 'foley', 'onsite', 'meeting', 'occur', 'industry', 'undeniably', 'impact', 'relatively', 'clear', 'sail', 'foley', 'say', 'business', 'cyclical', 'business', 'speed', 'intensity', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'caught', 'many', 'industry', 'offguard', 'although', 'casualty', 'majority', 'player', 'survivor', 'adapt', 'business', 'swing', 'past', 'say', 'foley']"
"South African Airwaysacting chief executive Zuks Ramasia will retire on 14 April, less than a year after assuming the position. The flag carrier says it has accepted a request from Ramasia for early retirement. Her interim successor will be announced “in due course”, adds the airline. South African Airways named Zuks Ramasia as acting chief executive of the flag-carrier in June 2019, following the resignation of Vuyani Jarana Ramasia became acting chief on 10 June 2019, following the resignation of Vuyani Jarana. The former general manager of operations had been appointed to run the struggling airline while it searched for a permanent successor to Jarana. She joined SAA as a cabin-crew member in 1992, rising through the ranks to become general manager of operations in 2012. “Her journey was truly an example of how a number of women are progressively moving up the ranks in previously male-dominated industries,” states SAA chair Thandeka Mgoduso. SAA is being restructured under a business rescue plan amid heavy losses and questions over its organisational structure. The South African auditor general's office in February testified to the chaotic condition of the carrier's organisation during a judicial commission examining allegations of corruption and fraud in state companies. It described some aspects of SAA's as “quite dire”, and detailed multiple concerns picked up during its audit of the company's financial state.",3,408,8.0,0.3371,"government, uk, carrier, business, state, share, south, airway, financial, plan","['south', 'african', 'airwaysacting', 'chief', 'executive', 'zuks', 'ramasia', 'retire', 'april', 'less', 'assume', 'position', 'flag', 'carrier', 'say', 'accepted', 'request', 'ramasia', 'early', 'retirement', 'interim', 'successor', 'announce', 'due', 'course', 'add', 'south', 'african', 'airway', 'name', 'zuks', 'ramasia', 'act', 'chief', 'executive', 'flagcarrier', 'june', 'follow', 'resignation', 'vuyani', 'jarana', 'ramasia', 'become', 'act', 'chief', 'june', 'follow', 'resignation', 'vuyani', 'jarana', 'former', 'general', 'manager', 'operation', 'appoint', 'run', 'struggle', 'search', 'permanent', 'successor', 'jarana', 'join', 'saa', 'cabincrew', 'member', 'rise', 'rank', 'become', 'general', 'manager', 'operation', 'journey', 'truly', 'example', 'number', 'woman', 'progressively', 'move', 'rank', 'previously', 'maledominated', 'industry', 'state', 'saa', 'chair', 'thandeka', 'mgoduso', 'saa', 'restructure', 'business', 'rescue', 'plan', 'amid', 'heavy', 'loss', 'question', 'organisational', 'structure', 'south', 'african', 'auditor', 'general', 'office', 'february', 'testify', 'chaotic', 'condition', 'carrier', 'organisation', 'judicial', 'commission', 'examine', 'allegation', 'corruption', 'fraud', 'state', 'described', 'aspect', 'saa', 'quite', 'dire', 'detailed', 'multiple', 'concern', 'picked', 'audit', 'financial', 'state']"
"Singapore Airlines has asked its pilots to take unpaid leave for up to seven days each month, starting 1 April. The airline tells Cirium this applies to pilots with the mainline carrier and regional carrier SilkAir, and the measures will be in place “until the business recovers”. It adds: “We have also reached agreements with our unions for a set of cost-cutting measures. These include voluntary no-pay leave for all staff up to division vice-presidents [and] varying days of compulsory no-pay leave ranging between one and seven days every month for pilots, executives and associates, as well as furlough for staff on re-employment contracts. These measures will impact about 10,000 staff.” Local newspaper Business Times reports that captains are to take seven days of unpaid leave per month, while first officers and second officers will take five days and four days, respectively. Pilots older than 62 and on re-employment contracts will be placed on furlough for at least six months. The same report quotes Kenneth Lai, president of the Air Line Pilots Association Singapore (Alpa-S), as saying that the latest measures, along with steep capacity cuts, will on average cut captains' salaries by as much as 55%. First officers and second officers will see reductions of up to 50% and 15%, respectively. These are computed against the pilots' total monthly package, comprising their basic salary and a variable component. Singapore Airlines declined to say when the next round of scheduled salary negotiations with Alpa-S would take place, citing confidentiality. Responding to Cirium's queries about how the latest measures will impact its liquidity, the group reiterates that it has drawn on its lines of credit to meet immediate cash-flow requirements and is in discussions with several financial institutions for future funding needs. It says: “The company continues to explore measures to shore up its liquidity during this unprecedented disruption to global air travel.”",3,409,2.0,0.2852,"executive, chief, cut, add, situation, staff, crisis, make, coronavirus, employee","['singapore', 'ask', 'pilot', 'take', 'unpaid', 'leave', 'day', 'month', 'start', 'april', 'tell', 'applies', 'pilot', 'mainline', 'carrier', 'regional', 'carrier', 'silkair', 'measure', 'place', 'business', 'recovers', 'add', 'reach', 'agreement', 'union', 'set', 'costcutting', 'measure', 'include', 'voluntary', 'nopay', 'leave', 'staff', 'division', 'vicepresidents', 'vary', 'day', 'compulsory', 'nopay', 'leave', 'range', 'day', 'every', 'month', 'pilot', 'executive', 'associate', 'well', 'furlough', 'staff', 'reemployment', 'contract', 'measure', 'impact', 'local', 'newspaper', 'business', 'report', 'captain', 'take', 'day', 'unpaid', 'leave', 'per', 'month', 'officer', 'second', 'officer', 'take', 'day', 'day', 'respectively', 'pilot', 'old', 'reemployment', 'contract', 'place', 'furlough', 'least', 'month', 'report', 'quote', 'kenneth', 'lai', 'president', 'line', 'pilot', 'association', 'singapore', 'alpas', 'say', 'late', 'measure', 'along', 'steep', 'capacity', 'cut', 'average', 'cut', 'captain', 'salary', 'much', 'officer', 'second', 'officer', 'see', 'reduction', 'respectively', 'compute', 'pilot', 'total', 'monthly', 'package', 'comprise', 'basic', 'salary', 'variable', 'component', 'singapore', 'decline', 'say', 'next', 'round', 'schedule', 'salary', 'negotiation', 'alpas', 'take', 'place', 'cite', 'confidentiality', 'respond', 'query', 'late', 'measure', 'impact', 'liquidity', 'reiterates', 'drawn', 'line', 'credit', 'meet', 'immediate', 'cashflow', 'requirement', 'discussion', 'several', 'financial', 'institution', 'future', 'funding', 'need', 'say', 'continue', 'explore', 'measure', 'shore', 'liquidity', 'unprecedented', 'disruption', 'global', 'travel']"
"As the US Congress debated a government assistance bill that would help the aviation and aerospace industry weather the financial storm of the coronavirus crisis, the Pentagon warned that the current pandemic could lead to geopolitical instability. A government aid package currently making its way through the US Congress calls for loans and payroll support for airlines and aviation industry workers of $78 billion altogether, but links the assistance to strict conditions regarding executive pay, stock buybacks, dividends and requirements to maintain employee levels through the third quarter of the year. According to a Senate official familiar with the $2 trillion draft bill, the legislation as it stands on 25 March includes loans to passenger airlines and related businesses ($25 billion), cargo airlines ($4 billion) and business “critical to maintaining national security” ($17 billion). Aside from loans, the Senate seeks to provide ”payroll support” to the tune of another $29 billion for passenger and cargo airlines, and $3 billion for contractors like baggage handlers and catering workers. This money must be used for wages, benefits and health care, the official adds. The legislation must pass both houses of Congress and be signed into law by President Donald Trump before these provisions can take effect. Meantime, the Pentagon is looking to maintain its readiness to fight, despite quarantine restrictions which have cancelled military exercises and interrupted the US defence industrial base in the past few weeks. The US defence forces also say poorer countries could struggle with the long-term effects of the virus. That might create opportunities for foes like China and Russia who may take advantage of the chaos. Some alleged bad behavior includes spreading false information and cybersecurity attacks.

"The US Department of Defense (DoD) is preparing for geopolitical instability as the hospitals of poorer countries become swamped by victims of the coronavirus and as foes, such as China and Russia, try to take advantage of the situation. The Pentagon is looking to maintain its readiness to fight, despite quarantine restrictions which have cancelled military exercises and interrupted the US defence industrial base. For its part, the US Air Force (USAF) is juggling the same geopolitical dangers, while providing an emergency air lift services for vital medical supplies and Americans stranded abroad. In particular, the DoD is worried about social unrest and predatory behavior, its leaders said in two press conferences on 24 March and 25 March. “This is affecting different countries differently, and it depends on the level of rigor and robustness of the medical facilities' capacity inside each country,” says General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on 24 March. “In some cases, it could lead to social breakdowns. It could lead to political chaos in certain countries. We have to be attuned to that.” The same problems hurting the USA could be even greater in other countries, he says. “It could be resource shortages. We see that with masks and gloves and ventilators and so on and so forth, hospital capacities and so on,” says Milley. “These can have severe internal consequences to certain countries that go well beyond the immediate medical issue.” Secretary of defense Mark Esper says on 24 March that the DoD is cautiously watching how the coronavirus impacts foreign relations. “With allies, it may be incumbent upon us to help them with our own supplies, our own doctors, our own assistance,” he says. “With potential adversaries or adversaries, it may cause them to act out in different ways, and in ways that impact our security posture, our readiness. So we need to be very conscious and be on the lookout for that as this unfolds.” Some alleged bad behavior includes spreading false information and cybersecurity attacks. For example, the US government has accused China of trying to rewrite history and redirect blame for the spread of coronavirus. The Chinese foreign ministry suggested on 12 March that “it might be [the] US Army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan”. Meanwhile, in March, prominent health organizations, including the World Health Organization and US Health and Human Services Department (HHS), have been hit with sophisticated cyber-attacks. In the case of the HHS, a foreign state is the suspected attacker, reports Bloomberg. For its part, Taiwan scrambled jets on 16 March to intercept incoming Chinese aircraft. China's aircraft turned for home after being sent a broadcast warning, but Taipei complains that Beijing is increasing military exercises during the coronavirus crisis. Nonetheless, in some cases, the coronavirus may present an opportunity to extend an olive branch to old foes, says Esper. “We've had adversaries like Iran, who is also suffering very badly, and I [think it's] important to note that we've reached out to try and offer them aid and support,” he says. ADVERSARIAL CAPITAL The DoD is also worried that adversaries of the USA are looking to take advantage of the economic downturn caused by coronavirus to buy up important military technologies from companies desperately searching for cash. The Pentagon is on its guard against “adversarial capital” says Ellen Lord, undersecretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment for the Defense Department on 25 March. The concern is that shadowy lenders and investors – backed by foreign governments – would swoop in and offer financial aid to defence contractors, exposing military and trade secrets. “It is critically important that we understand that during this crisis the [economic] dip is vulnerable to adversarial capital,” says Lord. “So, we need to ensure companies can stay in business without losing their technology.” The DoD plans to heavily lean on previously established vetting processes, such as the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, to avoid losing key technological secrets. “We simply cannot afford to let this period of uncertainty eat into reviews. That [review of] foreign investments is shifting into hyper vigilance,” says Jennifer Santos, deputy assistant secretary of defense for industrial policy. The DoD also plans to use its Trusted Capital Marketplace programme to invest, alongside approved private financiers, in startups, she adds. The programme plans to host virtual events in place of in-person events. The Pentagon also recently announced that it would increase progress payments for work already completed on contracts from 80% to 90% of the contract total for large businesses and from 90% to 95% percent for small businesses. Faster payment to contractors is intended to improve their cash flow.",3,411,1.0,0.2692,"test, force, helicopter, fire, system, service, attack, design, usaf, missile","['u', 'department', 'defense', 'dod', 'prepare', 'geopolitical', 'instability', 'hospital', 'poorer', 'country', 'become', 'swamp', 'victim', 'coronavirus', 'foe', 'russia', 'try', 'take', 'advantage', 'situation', 'pentagon', 'look', 'maintain', 'readiness', 'fight', 'despite', 'quarantine', 'restriction', 'cancel', 'military', 'exercise', 'interrupt', 'u', 'defence', 'industrial', 'base', 'part', 'u', 'force', 'usaf', 'juggling', 'geopolitical', 'danger', 'provide', 'emergency', 'lift', 'service', 'vital', 'medical', 'supply', 'american', 'strand', 'abroad', 'particular', 'dod', 'worried', 'social', 'unrest', 'predatory', 'behavior', 'leader', 'say', 'press', 'conference', 'march', 'march', 'affect', 'different', 'country', 'differently', 'depends', 'level', 'rigor', 'robustness', 'medical', 'facility', 'capacity', 'inside', 'country', 'say', 'general', 'mark', 'milley', 'chairman', 'joint', 'chief', 'staff', 'march', 'case', 'lead', 'social', 'breakdown', 'lead', 'political', 'chaos', 'certain', 'country', 'attune', 'problem', 'hurt', 'usa', 'even', 'great', 'country', 'say', 'resource', 'shortage', 'see', 'mask', 'glove', 'ventilator', 'forth', 'hospital', 'capacity', 'say', 'milley', 'severe', 'internal', 'consequence', 'certain', 'country', 'go', 'well', 'beyond', 'immediate', 'medical', 'secretary', 'defense', 'mark', 'esper', 'say', 'march', 'dod', 'cautiously', 'watch', 'coronavirus', 'impact', 'foreign', 'relation', 'ally', 'may', 'incumbent', 'upon', 'u', 'help', 'supply', 'doctor', 'assistance', 'say', 'potential', 'adversary', 'adversary', 'may', 'cause', 'act', 'different', 'way', 'way', 'impact', 'security', 'posture', 'readiness', 'need', 'conscious', 'lookout', 'allege', 'bad', 'behavior', 'include', 'spread', 'false', 'information', 'cybersecurity', 'attack', 'example', 'u', 'government', 'accuse', 'try', 'rewrite', 'history', 'redirect', 'blame', 'spread', 'coronavirus', 'chinese', 'foreign', 'ministry', 'suggest', 'march', 'might', 'u', 'army', 'brought', 'epidemic', 'wuhan', 'meanwhile', 'march', 'prominent', 'health', 'organization', 'include', 'world', 'health', 'organization', 'u', 'health', 'human', 'service', 'department', 'hhs', 'hit', 'sophisticated', 'cyberattacks', 'case', 'hhs', 'foreign', 'state', 'suspect', 'attacker', 'report', 'bloomberg', 'part', 'taiwan', 'scramble', 'jet', 'march', 'intercept', 'incoming', 'chinese', 'turn', 'home', 'sent', 'broadcast', 'warn', 'taipei', 'complains', 'beijing', 'increase', 'military', 'exercise', 'coronavirus', 'crisis', 'nonetheless', 'case', 'coronavirus', 'may', 'present', 'opportunity', 'extend', 'olive', 'branch', 'old', 'foe', 'say', 'esper', 'adversary', 'like', 'iran', 'suffer', 'badly', 'think', 'important', 'note', 'reach', 'try', 'offer', 'aid', 'support', 'say', 'adversarial', 'capital', 'dod', 'worried', 'adversary', 'usa', 'look', 'take', 'advantage', 'economic', 'downturn', 'cause', 'coronavirus', 'buy', 'important', 'military', 'technology', 'desperately', 'search', 'cash', 'pentagon', 'guard', 'adversarial', 'capital', 'say', 'ellen', 'lord', 'undersecretary', 'defense', 'acquisition', 'sustainment', 'defense', 'department', 'march', 'concern', 'shadowy', 'lender', 'investor', 'back', 'foreign', 'government', 'swoop', 'offer', 'financial', 'aid', 'defence', 'contractor', 'expose', 'military', 'trade', 'secret', 'critically', 'important', 'understand', 'crisis', 'economic', 'dip', 'vulnerable', 'adversarial', 'capital', 'say', 'lord', 'need', 'ensure', 'stay', 'business', 'without', 'lose', 'dod', 'plan', 'heavily', 'lean', 'previously', 'establish', 'vet', 'process', 'committee', 'foreign', 'investment', 'united', 'state', 'avoid', 'lose', 'key', 'technological', 'secret', 'simply', 'afford', 'let', 'period', 'uncertainty', 'eat', 'review', 'review', 'foreign', 'investment', 'shift', 'hyper', 'vigilance', 'say', 'jennifer', 'santos', 'deputy', 'assistant', 'secretary', 'defense', 'industrial', 'policy', 'dod', 'plan', 'use', 'trust', 'capital', 'marketplace', 'programme', 'invest', 'alongside', 'approve', 'private', 'financier', 'startup', 'add', 'programme', 'plan', 'host', 'virtual', 'event', 'place', 'inperson', 'event', 'pentagon', 'recently', 'announce', 'increase', 'progress', 'payment', 'work', 'already', 'complete', 'contract', 'contract', 'total', 'large', 'business', 'percent', 'small', 'business', 'faster', 'payment', 'contractor', 'intend', 'improve', 'cash', 'flow']"
"London City airport is to close for all flights from this evening until the end of April. The operator of the downtown London airport says the move to temporarily suspend all commercial and private flights from the airport comes after the UK Government's latest instructions in response to the coronavirus outbreak. ”This will begin in the evening on Wednesday 25 March and is expected to last until the end of April.

"IATA has highlighted “record levels” of freighter demand amid a fall in passenger flights that has reduced global air cargo capacity by around 30%. Glyn Hughes, the airline association's global head of cargo, notes that freight carriers are responding to the surge in demand by delaying the retirement of aircraft.  Air cargo prices are meanwhile on the rise, he notes: “When you have this much demand for reduced capacity, it does have an economic impact.” Normally, passenger flights carry around 40-50% of global cargo capacity in their bellies, but the picture has been dramatically changed by cancellations because of the coronavirus and travel restrictions. IATA estimates that total cargo demand as measured by revenue-tonne kilometres fell 10% globally in February as China's economy reeled from the coronavirus. For March, the association expects a significantly greater reduction in cargo traffic, while for the whole of 2020 it sees a fall of 10-15%. While there has been a sharp decline in air cargo demand from sectors such as automotive manufacturing, this has been partially offset by an increase in shipments of medical equipment. Yet the reduction in passenger flights is “taking a huge amount of cargo capacity offline”, notes Hughes, though many passenger airlines now operating cargo-only flights. IATA is calling on governments to smooth the process for transporting air cargo in order to ensure that supply lines remain open. “Air cargo is a vital partner in the global fight against Covid-19,” states director general Alexandre de Juniac. “But we are still seeing examples of cargo flights filled with life-saving medical supplies and equipment grounded due to cumbersome and bureaucratic processes to secure slots and operating permits.”",3,413,9.0,0.3403,"industry, crisis, demand, coronavirus, global, iata, market, level, cargo, expect","['iata', 'highlight', 'record', 'level', 'freighter', 'demand', 'amid', 'fall', 'passenger', 'reduce', 'global', 'cargo', 'capacity', 'around', 'glyn', 'hughes', 'association', 'global', 'head', 'cargo', 'note', 'freight', 'carrier', 'respond', 'surge', 'demand', 'delay', 'retirement', 'cargo', 'price', 'meanwhile', 'rise', 'note', 'much', 'demand', 'reduce', 'capacity', 'economic', 'normally', 'passenger', 'carry', 'around', 'global', 'cargo', 'capacity', 'belly', 'picture', 'dramatically', 'change', 'cancellation', 'coronavirus', 'travel', 'restriction', 'iata', 'estimate', 'total', 'cargo', 'demand', 'measure', 'revenuetonne', 'kilometre', 'fell', 'globally', 'february', 'economy', 'reel', 'coronavirus', 'march', 'association', 'expect', 'significantly', 'great', 'reduction', 'cargo', 'traffic', 'whole', 'see', 'fall', 'sharp', 'decline', 'cargo', 'demand', 'sector', 'automotive', 'manufacturing', 'partially', 'offset', 'increase', 'shipment', 'medical', 'equipment', 'yet', 'reduction', 'passenger', 'take', 'huge', 'amount', 'cargo', 'capacity', 'offline', 'note', 'hughes', 'though', 'many', 'passenger', 'operating', 'cargoonly', 'iata', 'call', 'government', 'smooth', 'process', 'transport', 'cargo', 'order', 'ensure', 'supply', 'line', 'remain', 'open', 'cargo', 'vital', 'partner', 'global', 'fight', 'coronavirus', 'state', 'director', 'general', 'alexandre', 'de', 'juniac', 'still', 'see', 'example', 'cargo', 'fill', 'lifesaving', 'medical', 'supply', 'equipment', 'ground', 'due', 'cumbersome', 'bureaucratic', 'process', 'secure', 'slot', 'operating', 'permit']"
"African budget carrier Fastjet, already under substantial financial pressure, is having to cope with the additional burden of the coronavirus outbreak after the South African and Zimbabwean governments imposed travel restrictions. Fastjet Group, which has been working to sell its Zimbabwean arm, says the South African government is locking down the country from 26 March to 16 April, while Zimbabwe is banning all non-essential travel as part of its measures to contain the outbreak. The company is suspending all Zimbabwe flight operations for three weeks from 27 March. It adds that its FedAir operation is experiencing “significant deferrals” of current bookings to late 2020, away from the typical peak seasons around the Easter and summer holiday periods. Fastjet Group has not indicated the potential financial impact of the Zimbabwean suspension or the adjustments to the booking pattern, or the effect on its intended divestment of the Zimbabwean division It states that it had cash reserves of $2.2 million, including $200,000 unrestricted in Zimbabwe, at 23 March, a figure unchanged since 11 March. Fastjet Group had planned to meet the conditions for the Zimbabwean sale this month, and complete the divestment, to an investor consortium, in April, but had also warned that its cash reserves and forecasts remained “very sensitive” to any significant downturn in its business.",3,414,8.0,0.2573,"government, uk, carrier, business, state, share, south, airway, financial, plan","['african', 'budget', 'carrier', 'fastjet', 'already', 'substantial', 'financial', 'pressure', 'cope', 'additional', 'burden', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'south', 'african', 'zimbabwean', 'government', 'impose', 'travel', 'restriction', 'fastjet', 'work', 'sell', 'zimbabwean', 'arm', 'say', 'south', 'african', 'government', 'lock', 'country', 'march', 'april', 'zimbabwe', 'ban', 'nonessential', 'travel', 'part', 'measure', 'contain', 'outbreak', 'suspend', 'zimbabwe', 'operation', 'week', 'march', 'add', 'fedair', 'operation', 'experience', 'significant', 'deferral', 'current', 'booking', 'late', 'away', 'typical', 'peak', 'season', 'around', 'easter', 'summer', 'holiday', 'period', 'fastjet', 'indicate', 'potential', 'financial', 'impact', 'zimbabwean', 'suspension', 'adjustment', 'book', 'pattern', 'effect', 'intend', 'divestment', 'zimbabwean', 'division', 'state', 'cash', 'reserve', 'include', 'unrestricted', 'zimbabwe', 'march', 'figure', 'unchanged', 'since', 'march', 'fastjet', 'plan', 'meet', 'condition', 'zimbabwean', 'sale', 'month', 'complete', 'divestment', 'investor', 'consortium', 'april', 'warn', 'cash', 'reserve', 'forecast', 'remain', 'sensitive', 'significant', 'downturn', 'business']"
"Air New Zealand will operate limited services to enable essential travel and maintain cargo flow, even as it cuts international schedules by 95% from 30 March to 31 May. This will “keep air freight moving through key cargo corridors to North America and Asia,” it says.  The carrier will operate three long-haul services from Auckland, flying thrice-weekly to Los Angeles, twice a week to Hong Kong, and to Shanghai on alternate days, starting 2 May. The Hong Kong service will be retimed to a night operation “to maximise connection opportunities for cargo”. The carrier will also maintain three trans-Tasman routes, each operated twice- or thrice-weekly, and five weekly Pacific services. It plans to operate weekly services to Samoa and Tonga if restrictions on international travel are lifted.

"Cebu Pacific says the month-long “community quarantine” imposed on metropolitan Manila and the main Luzon island group recently will free up 90% of its total seat capacity, even as it maintains services from its hubs outside of Manila and the region. The 90% capacity figure is based on the suspension of domestic flights departing Manila, and previously suspended services to China, Hong Kong, Macau and South Korea, says Cebu Pacific in a Philippines Stock Exchange disclosure. During this period, the airline continues to operate flights from its other hubs that have not been affected by the quarantine order such as Cebu, and is maintaining connectivity “where operationally feasible”. Cirium schedules data show that in February, domestic routes accounted for 83% of Cebu Pacific and subsidiary Cebgo's seat capacity. Although it expects a “significant revenue impact” during the quarantine period, operating expenses will fall in tandem, while lower fuel prices provide an additional cost benefit to its reduced fuel consumption. Cebu Pacific was unable to provide any earnings guidance for 2020, due to uncertainties caused by the coronavirus pandemic. However, it stressed that it has a strong balance sheet with “over Ps18 billion ($353 million) in cash and cash equivalents” at the end of 2019, and that a net debt to equity level of around 1.25x with a long maturity profile gives the airline room to seek short-term or long-term funding. It is also conserving cash and reducing expenses by freezing recruitment and consultancy work, implementing pay cuts for its top management, and suspending salary increases. Earlier in February, the carrier estimated that the outbreak will see a “Ps3-4 billion swing on profit” should the outbreak remain unabated over the next six months. The estimate was based on 2003's Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome outbreak, which curtailed demand for air travel for six months.

"Boeing chief executive David Calhoun insists government aid to the struggling airline and aerospace sectors should not be contingent upon the government taking equity in US companies. “Nobody has an interest in retaining government equity in their company. We want to pay everything back,” Calhoun tellsFox Businesson 24 March. He also insists Boeing remains fundamentally sound despite the severity of the coronavirus downturn. “I have no less optimism for our commercial business than I did before this started,” he says. His comments come as Boeing seeks $60 billion in federal US aid to help itself, its 17,000 suppliers and the broader aerospace industry weather the coronavirus downturn. Meanwhile, Boeing's US airline customers have urged Congress to provide them with some $58 billion in financial support.  Boeing's Everett, Washington widebody manufacturing site Congress has been wrangling over the package in recent days, with sticking points including worker protections, the degree to which aid will be in the form of grants or loans, and whether the government will take equity in, or set other conditions upon, companies that receive aid. On Fox Business, Calhoun denies that requests by Boeing and other companies for government funds amount to corporate welfare. “It's anything but corporate welfare,” Calhoun says. “Government is supposed to step up, to get us from one end to the other. Whatever tool they put in place should be simple, straightforward and immediately accessible.” Calhoun notes Boeing holds $15 billion in cash. He says the company “will get through this” and that the “enterprise is not threatened”. “But the credit markets are closed to us,” Calhoun adds. Boeing on 23 March announced it will suspend production in Washington state for two weeks due to a coronavirus outbreak at its facilities. Aerospace manufacturing suppliers have likewise been reeling, reporting fast-moving developments and broad business uncertainly. On 23 March, General Electric said GE Aviation, which makes commercial aircraft turbofans, is laying off 10% of US workers and furloughing half its maintenance, repair and overhaul staff for 90 days. GE did not immediately say if Boeing's production halt will spur additional staff or production actions. Supplier Triumph Group on 24 March said it will lay off 250 salaried staff and 250 contractors, and Spirit AeroSystems is halting much of its Boeing-related work. Another supplier, Collins Aerospace, says some of its sites “have been closed in areas that have been hardest hit by the virus, and some have been closed temporarily for cleaning”. “The majority of our sites are still up and running,” Collins says. Another engine maker, Pratt & Whitney, says all its facilities are up and running. On Fox Business, Calhoun insists Boeing will survive even without government aid. He says the company might need more “haircuts” without federal support, while stressing Boeing must do all possible to limit staff reductions so as to ensure it has resources needed to resume operations when the coronavirus crisis abates. “I have to keep my workforce in place and we have got to be ready when recovery comes,” he says. The CEO also insisted the 737 Max remains on track for mid-2020 certification. “We remain on schedule...Everything so far looks good for the certification of the Max at the mid-point of the year.”",3,417,0.0,0.3279,"order, business, jet, delivery, production, customer, deliver, commercial, quarter, include","['chief', 'executive', 'david', 'calhoun', 'insists', 'government', 'aid', 'struggle', 'sector', 'contingent', 'upon', 'government', 'take', 'equity', 'u', 'nobody', 'interest', 'retain', 'government', 'equity', 'want', 'pay', 'everything', 'back', 'calhoun', 'tellsfox', 'businesson', 'march', 'insists', 'remains', 'fundamentally', 'sound', 'despite', 'severity', 'coronavirus', 'downturn', 'less', 'optimism', 'commercial', 'business', 'start', 'say', 'comment', 'come', 'seek', 'federal', 'u', 'aid', 'help', 'supplier', 'broader', 'industry', 'weather', 'coronavirus', 'downturn', 'meanwhile', 'u', 'customer', 'urge', 'congress', 'provide', 'financial', 'support', 'everett', 'washington', 'widebody', 'manufacturing', 'site', 'congress', 'wrangle', 'package', 'recent', 'day', 'stick', 'point', 'include', 'worker', 'protection', 'degree', 'aid', 'form', 'grant', 'loan', 'whether', 'government', 'take', 'equity', 'set', 'condition', 'upon', 'receive', 'aid', 'fox', 'business', 'calhoun', 'denies', 'request', 'government', 'fund', 'amount', 'corporate', 'welfare', 'anything', 'corporate', 'welfare', 'calhoun', 'say', 'government', 'suppose', 'step', 'get', 'u', 'end', 'whatever', 'tool', 'put', 'place', 'simple', 'straightforward', 'immediately', 'calhoun', 'note', 'hold', 'cash', 'say', 'get', 'enterprise', 'threaten', 'credit', 'market', 'close', 'u', 'calhoun', 'add', 'march', 'announce', 'suspend', 'production', 'washington', 'state', 'week', 'due', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'facility', 'manufacturing', 'supplier', 'likewise', 'reel', 'reporting', 'fastmoving', 'development', 'broad', 'business', 'uncertainly', 'march', 'general', 'electric', 'say', 'ge', 'make', 'commercial', 'turbofan', 'lay', 'u', 'worker', 'furlough', 'half', 'maintenance', 'repair', 'overhaul', 'staff', 'day', 'ge', 'immediately', 'say', 'production', 'halt', 'spur', 'additional', 'staff', 'production', 'action', 'supplier', 'triumph', 'march', 'say', 'lay', 'salaried', 'staff', 'contractor', 'spirit', 'aerosystems', 'halt', 'much', 'boeingrelated', 'work', 'another', 'supplier', 'collins', 'say', 'site', 'close', 'area', 'hardest', 'hit', 'virus', 'close', 'temporarily', 'cleaning', 'majority', 'site', 'still', 'run', 'collins', 'say', 'another', 'engine', 'maker', 'pratt', 'whitney', 'say', 'facility', 'run', 'fox', 'business', 'calhoun', 'insists', 'survive', 'even', 'without', 'government', 'aid', 'say', 'might', 'need', 'haircut', 'without', 'federal', 'support', 'stress', 'must', 'possible', 'limit', 'staff', 'reduction', 'ensure', 'resource', 'need', 'resume', 'operation', 'coronavirus', 'crisis', 'abates', 'keep', 'workforce', 'place', 'get', 'ready', 'recovery', 'come', 'say', 'ceo', 'insist', 'remains', 'track', 'certification', 'remain', 'schedule', 'everything', 'far', 'look', 'good', 'certification', 'midpoint']"
"WestJet has eliminated about half of its workforce as it tries to preserve itself while the coronavirus continues ravaging the air transport industry, says chief executive Ed Sims. “Today, 6,900 WestJetters are receiving notices confirming early retirements, early outs and both voluntary and involuntary leaves,” Sims says in a video message posted on the airline's website on 24 March. The airline had about 14,000 workers prior to the cuts. “This is devastating news for all WestJetters. The fact that we avoided a potentially worse outcome is testament to the spirit and selfless attitude demonstrated by our people, who have enabled WestJet to continue operating with a collective remaining workforce of 7,100.” About 90% of those being made redundant accepted voluntary departures, for a period of no less than three months, and some permanently, he adds. “It is through these WestJetters' sacrifices that we can preserve a core of people who will remain employed to prepare for the moment when the situation stabilises, and we can look to rise again,” Sims says. The Calgary-based airline, Canada's second to flag carrier Air Canada, is currently operating at about the same size it was in 2003, having cancelled all international operations and working a skeleton domestic service. The airline has grounded 120 aircraft, which is about two thirds of its fleet, Sims says. The carrier, like peers in North America and around the world, has taken radical measures to preserve cash. Executive team members and directors have taken pay cuts, the airline released about 80% of contractors, instituted a hiring freeze, stopped non-essential travel and paused about three quarters of its capital projects. All Canadian airlines have been hit hard by the crisis. On Tuesday, Air Transat said it would be cutting 70% of its staff and suspend all flights from 1 April.

"China's domestic passenger airline market is showing signs of improvement as the country's coronavirus restrictions are lifted, according to IATA. “We are seeing some signs of a turning point in the Chinese domestic market,” says IATA chief economist Brian Pearce during a briefing today. “The March numbers are showing an improvement. We're certainly getting those reports from the market.” Airlines in China had been discounting seats by up to 25% year-on-year in February, but “that's stabilising” in March, Pearce notes. Indeed, IATA's figures indicate that passenger yields on Chinese domestic flights booked in the first two weeks of March are up slightly year-on-year. IATA also notes that load factors on domestic services have been around the 60% mark. Cirium schedules data for February shows China's carriers slashed domestic capacity by nearly 50% year-on-year, but that fall has moderated to around 30% in March. Overall passenger yields among Chinese carriers – including international flights – are still down by more than 25% for tickets booked in the first two weeks of March. The industry association also states that the initial impact of the coronavirus outbreak on airline traffic in China's domestic market was more severe than that seen amid the SARS outbreak in 2002-03. The SARS and coronavirus epidemics are both believed to have originated in China, meaning its markets were hit early on. While the improving situation in China means “it's not all bad news”, for the global airline industry, Pearce cautions that the country's story is an exception to a bleak picture elsewhere. “For the industry as a whole that is absolutely what is not happening,” he explains. “The spread of Covid-19 cases outside of the Asia-Pacific region is very dramatically hitting bookings, as well as the closure of borders that we are seeing.” Pearce also cites the impact on some markets in Asia-Pacific of a “second wave” of coronavirus cases as people return home from other regions.",3,420,9.0,0.2572,"industry, crisis, demand, coronavirus, global, iata, market, level, cargo, expect","['domestic', 'passenger', 'market', 'sign', 'improvement', 'country', 'coronavirus', 'restriction', 'lift', 'accord', 'iata', 'see', 'sign', 'turn', 'point', 'chinese', 'domestic', 'market', 'say', 'iata', 'chief', 'economist', 'brian', 'pearce', 'briefing', 'today', 'march', 'number', 'improvement', 'certainly', 'get', 'report', 'discounting', 'seat', 'yearonyear', 'february', 'stabilise', 'march', 'pearce', 'note', 'indeed', 'iata', 'figure', 'indicate', 'passenger', 'yield', 'chinese', 'domestic', 'book', 'week', 'march', 'slightly', 'yearonyear', 'iata', 'note', 'load', 'factor', 'domestic', 'service', 'around', 'mark', 'schedule', 'data', 'february', 'carrier', 'slash', 'domestic', 'capacity', 'nearly', 'yearonyear', 'fall', 'moderate', 'around', 'march', 'overall', 'passenger', 'yield', 'among', 'chinese', 'carrier', 'include', 'international', 'still', 'ticket', 'book', 'week', 'march', 'industry', 'association', 'state', 'initial', 'impact', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'traffic', 'domestic', 'market', 'severe', 'see', 'amid', 'sars', 'outbreak', 'sars', 'coronavirus', 'epidemic', 'believe', 'originate', 'meaning', 'market', 'hit', 'early', 'improve', 'situation', 'mean', 'bad', 'news', 'global', 'industry', 'pearce', 'caution', 'country', 'story', 'exception', 'bleak', 'picture', 'elsewhere', 'industry', 'whole', 'absolutely', 'happen', 'explains', 'spread', 'coronavirus', 'case', 'outside', 'asiapacific', 'region', 'dramatically', 'hit', 'booking', 'well', 'closure', 'border', 'pearce', 'cite', 'impact', 'market', 'asiapacific', 'second', 'wave', 'coronavirus', 'case', 'people', 'return', 'home', 'region']"
"Ukrainian investigators have determined that the autothrottle of a Belavia Boeing 737-300 was left active before the aircraft touched down long and overran at Kiev Zhulhany. The jet had been operating from Minsk on 12 July last year, and had been descending in darkness and rain to Kiev's downtown airport. Ukrainian investigation authority NBAAI says that, during the descent, the runway in use was changed from 08 to 26. As the aircraft passed through 500ft – at a distance of about 2km from the airport – the autopilot was disengaged and the crew continued manually with the autothrottle still active. The crew was informed about the condition of the runway, being told that it was wet, with good braking and a friction coefficient of 0.52. Maximum autobrake was set. Examination of the aircraft's profile shows it crossed the displaced threshold at 36ft and 141kt, but that the flare lasted 14.5s. The jet only touched down 970m beyond the threshold, and the inquiry says the autothrottle's engagement was a “major factor” contributing to the long landing. Full reverse-thrust and maximum automatic braking was applied 4s after the landing. But the crew also applied manual braking after sensing that the jet was not decelerating fast enough. The crew disengaged reverse-thrust at 61kt and the inquiry says the jet then received an “additional impulse” of direct thrust which prevented the crew was stopping within the runway length. Analysis of the incident shows the aircraft experienced hydroplaning and tyre overheating, further contributing to the overrun. While the coefficient of friction of the runway, measured after the event, was lower than the figure given to the crew, the inquiry says the aircraft should still have been able to stop in time, adding that reverse-thrust should have remained engaged until the 737 had slowed sufficiently. Only minor damage to the aircraft (EW-336PA) resulted from the overrun. The inquiry says the crew experienced “high emotional and physical exertion” which, it states, led to incorrect decision-making.",3,421,7.0,0.5624,"crew, runway, inquiry, land, approach, accident, investigator, captain, incident, pilot","['ukrainian', 'investigator', 'determine', 'autothrottle', 'belavia', 'left', 'active', 'touch', 'long', 'overran', 'kiev', 'zhulhany', 'jet', 'operating', 'minsk', 'july', 'descend', 'darkness', 'rain', 'kiev', 'downtown', 'airport', 'ukrainian', 'investigation', 'authority', 'nbaai', 'say', 'descent', 'runway', 'use', 'change', 'pass', 'distance', 'airport', 'autopilot', 'disengage', 'crew', 'continued', 'manually', 'autothrottle', 'still', 'active', 'crew', 'inform', 'condition', 'runway', 'told', 'wet', 'good', 'brake', 'friction', 'coefficient', 'maximum', 'autobrake', 'set', 'examination', 'profile', 'cross', 'displace', 'threshold', 'flare', 'jet', 'touch', 'beyond', 'threshold', 'inquiry', 'say', 'autothrottle', 'engagement', 'major', 'factor', 'contribute', 'long', 'land', 'full', 'reversethrust', 'maximum', 'automatic', 'brake', 'apply', 'land', 'crew', 'apply', 'manual', 'brake', 'sense', 'jet', 'decelerate', 'fast', 'enough', 'crew', 'disengage', 'reversethrust', 'inquiry', 'say', 'jet', 'receive', 'additional', 'impulse', 'direct', 'thrust', 'prevent', 'crew', 'stop', 'within', 'runway', 'length', 'analysis', 'incident', 'experienced', 'hydroplane', 'tyre', 'overheat', 'far', 'contribute', 'overrun', 'coefficient', 'friction', 'runway', 'measure', 'event', 'low', 'figure', 'give', 'crew', 'inquiry', 'say', 'still', 'able', 'stop', 'add', 'reversethrust', 'remain', 'engage', 'slow', 'sufficiently', 'minor', 'damage', 'result', 'overrun', 'inquiry', 'say', 'crew', 'experienced', 'high', 'emotional', 'physical', 'exertion', 'state', 'lead', 'incorrect', 'decisionmaking']"
"IATA now expects the coronavirus outbreak to reduce airline revenues from passenger operations by $252 billion in 2020 – more than double its earlier worst-case-scenario estimate. That equates to a 44% fall in passenger revenues from 2019 and is driven by a 38% reduction in global traffic measured in RPKs year-on-year and falling yields. Speaking today as the revised figures were released, IATA director general Alexandre de Juniac described the coronavirus outbreak as the “deepest crisis” the industry has ever faced. “We need governments to act fast with financial relief”, he states, otherwise “almost half” of airlines would “die” in the coming weeks. Earlier in March, IATA suggested the impact on revenues would be in the range of $63 billion to $113 billion.

"US aerospace companies continue to take radical measures to try to reduce the impact of the coronavirus on their business as politicians negotiate a federal aid package designed to assist businesses through the crisis. GE Aviation intends to lay off 10% of its staff and furlough 50% of MRO workers for 90 days in response to collapse of air travel demand. The company builds the GEnx turbofan, which is an option on the Boeing 787, as well as the GE9X for the 777X. It is also a partner in CFM International, maker of Leap-series turbofans, which power 737 Max and Airbus A320neo-family aircraft. It is one of the first major aerospace companies to publicly announce significant lay-offs due to the coronavirus pandemic. Meanwhile, Boeing's shares were suspended from trading on the New York Stock Exchange just before the company announced that it was stopping all production in its facilities in the northwestern US Puget Sound area for the next two weeks due to the virus. Staffers who cannot work from home during that period will receive 10 days of paid leave, Boeing says. The developments come one day after reports that a Boeing employee at the company's Everett, Washington 787 site died of coronavirus infection. An employee at the company's North Charleston, South Carolina 787 site has also tested positive, according to reports. Boeing would not confirm either report, citing the need to respect workers' and workers' families' privacy.  United Airlines 787 Dreamliner Airlines continue to adjust their schedules as demand warrants, with some carriers offering repatriation flights for citizens who have been stuck in overseas locations, after carriers cut their capacities and reduced operations one by one in the last several weeks. United Airlines reinstated some of its international flights just a day after it suspended 95% of its schedule. The Chicago-based carrier said it will maintain three daily connections from North America to Europe, two to Asia Pacific and one to South America through the month of April. In addition, several flights to other destinations, to be completed by 29 March, will be repatriating US citizens. Air Canada also reinstated some international flights, specifically to Spain and South America, in order to repatriate thousands of Canadians stranded in those locations. Vacation specialist Air Transat said early in the day that it would lay off 70% of its staff and suspend flights for the entire month of April. Together, the two airlines have returned more than 240,000 guests to Canada in the past week. Meantime, in the US Congress, politicians continued to negotiate an aid package to help the industry as it suffers through the worst financial crisis in its history. A deal is expected to be announced sometime this week.

"The US Navy's Next Generation Jammer Mid-Band development pod finished initial testing in an anechoic chamber, a special room designed to absorb electromagnetic waves. The Raytheon-made radar jammer completed more than 400h of basic functionality, electromagnetic environmental effects data collection and performance testing over a period of three months, says US Naval Air Systems Command. Tests were performed at the Air Combat Environmental Test and Evaluation Facility anechoic chamber at Naval Air Station Patuxent River in Maryland. The Jammer Mid-Band pod is the US Navy's (USN) latest jamming system. It is to ride under the wing of the Boeing E/A-18 Growler electronic attack aircraft and disrupt adversary radio communications and radar-guided missile systems. “Data captured during this period not only supports our initial flight clearance, but also provided lessons learned that will benefit the entire [Next Generation Jammer Mid-Band] test programme moving forward,” says Captain Michael Orr, Airborne Electronic Attack Systems programme manager. The USN plans for the Jammer Mid-Band pod to enter flight testing this spring. The service it projecting the programme will reach Milestone C, the engineering design review prior to production, before the end of this fiscal year. The new jammer uses an active electronically scanned array, instead of a mechanically-steered transmitter, which increases the systems performance. Raytheon says the system can jam targets at further distances and attack multiple targets at once. The Jammer Mid-Band pod also was designed with an open systems architecture and modular design, which should allow for rapid upgrades, says the manufacturer. Quicker upgrades are important to help the USN keep pace with adversaries such as China and Russia who will likely adjust tactics and methods to avoid being jammed. The Jammer Mid-Band pod is intended to disrupt radar and communication in the mid-band frequency range. It will be initially paired with the USN's the legacy ALQ-99 Tactical Jamming System, until new low- and high-band jammers are developed and deployed, says the service.",3,425,1.0,0.5804,"test, force, helicopter, fire, system, service, attack, design, usaf, missile","['u', 'navy', 'next', 'generation', 'jammer', 'midband', 'development', 'pod', 'finish', 'initial', 'test', 'anechoic', 'chamber', 'special', 'room', 'design', 'absorb', 'electromagnetic', 'wave', 'raytheonmade', 'radar', 'jammer', 'complete', 'basic', 'functionality', 'electromagnetic', 'environmental', 'effect', 'data', 'collection', 'performance', 'test', 'period', 'month', 'say', 'u', 'naval', 'system', 'command', 'test', 'perform', 'combat', 'environmental', 'test', 'evaluation', 'facility', 'anechoic', 'chamber', 'naval', 'station', 'patuxent', 'river', 'maryland', 'jammer', 'midband', 'pod', 'u', 'navy', 'usn', 'late', 'jamming', 'system', 'ride', 'wing', 'growler', 'electronic', 'attack', 'disrupt', 'adversary', 'radio', 'communication', 'radarguided', 'missile', 'system', 'data', 'capture', 'period', 'support', 'initial', 'clearance', 'provide', 'lesson', 'learn', 'benefit', 'entire', 'next', 'generation', 'jammer', 'midband', 'test', 'programme', 'move', 'forward', 'say', 'captain', 'michael', 'orr', 'airborne', 'electronic', 'attack', 'system', 'programme', 'manager', 'usn', 'plan', 'jammer', 'midband', 'pod', 'enter', 'test', 'spring', 'service', 'project', 'programme', 'reach', 'milestone', 'c', 'engineering', 'design', 'review', 'prior', 'production', 'end', 'fiscal', 'jammer', 'active', 'electronically', 'scan', 'array', 'instead', 'mechanicallysteered', 'transmitter', 'increase', 'system', 'performance', 'raytheon', 'say', 'system', 'jam', 'target', 'far', 'distance', 'attack', 'multiple', 'target', 'jammer', 'midband', 'pod', 'design', 'open', 'system', 'architecture', 'modular', 'design', 'allow', 'rapid', 'upgrade', 'say', 'manufacturer', 'quicker', 'upgrade', 'important', 'help', 'usn', 'keep', 'pace', 'adversary', 'russia', 'likely', 'adjust', 'tactic', 'method', 'avoid', 'jammed', 'jammer', 'midband', 'pod', 'intend', 'disrupt', 'radar', 'communication', 'midband', 'frequency', 'range', 'initially', 'pair', 'usn', 'legacy', 'tactical', 'jamming', 'system', 'low', 'highband', 'jammer', 'developed', 'deployed', 'say', 'service']"
"Air Canada will reinstate some international connections in an effort to repatriate citizens who have become stranded overseas as a result of the global coronavirus pandemic. The Montreal-based flag carrier says it will operate six flights to destinations in Spain and South America to pick up travellers who have been stuck there since much of global aviation shut down in the past week. “Several hundred Canadians trapped in Peru, Ecuador and Spain since the imposition of restrictive travel measures by the authorities will finally be able to return home,” Calin Rovinescu, the flag carrier's chief executive says on 23 March. “Air Canada remains fully mobilised [in] dealing with this global health crisis and we have committed to keep operating internationally, transborder to the US and across Canada to allow people to return to Canadian soil as quickly as possible.” The carrier also commits to transporting needed cargo, including emergency supplies. Air Canada says that although it has substantially drawn down its network, in the past week it brought more than 200,000 Canadians back to Canada from all over the world. By the end of March, the carrier says it will have operated more than 300 flights from international airports and 850 flights from US airports. The airline says it will maintain some transborder and international flights after 1 April “to maintain a number of 'air bridges' to facilitate essential travel and ensure the continued movement of emergency supplies and other vital goods”. On 20 March, Air Canada temporarily laid of 5,100 cabin crew as it reduced capacity. Like many of its peers, Air Canada withdrew earnings guidance for 2020 and 2021. Earlier on 23 March, vacation specialist Air Transat said it was laying off 70% of staff as it shutters operations for the entire month of April. Since 18 March, Air Transat had brought some 40,000 customers back to Canada from Transat's destinations outside Canada. Some 25,000 customers remain outside the country, Transat says.

"Airbus is evaluating potential impact of the coronavirus outbreak on production, particularly for twin-aisle aircraft, and acknowledges that it might have to store aircraft as tightening restrictions obstruct deliveries. But the airframer is emphasising that it retains a strong backlog, especially in the single-aisle sector, which will help to reduce adverse effects on its business. Airbus chief executive Guillaume Faury, speaking during a 23 March briefing, said that the twin-aisle market had already been dealing with an oversupply situation during 2018-19. He says the actions in the air transport industry over the outbreak were “very likely” to result in further oversupply and that the airframer will have to “take decisions”, based on one-by-one discussions with customers.  Faury would not be drawn on the overall effect on Airbus deliveries this year or the extent to which production might have to be trimmed. “We're not trying to deny the obvious,” he says, adding that “there will be a lot of consequences” but stating that the company needs to take time to assess and adapt – part of the reason for its unveiling of a new €15 billion credit package to enhance liquidity. After suspending production temporarily – initially in China and then in France and Spain, all of which has since been restored – Airbus is “not putting priority on flow”, says Faury, but rather on taking the steps necessary to achieve stability and a reasonable level of activity. He says the increasingly tight restrictions on travel have put a “lot of additional difficulties” on the delivery effort, and that while the company had “managed to keep a certain flow”, the airframer was looking at the possibility of storing completed aircraft. Airbus deliveries during February were down slightly on the previous year, 86 against 88 despite the longer 29-day month, with fewer widebodies handed over, and chief financial officer Dominik Asam says the March figures will also be “tough”. Although coronavirus emerged in China, where Airbus has around 100 suppliers, Faury says there has been “no disruption” from the Chinese supply chain over the last few weeks and months. But he admits that the situation is “becoming increasingly more complex” after the outbreak spread to Europe and the USA, and that Airbus is “anticipating more difficulties”. German manufacturer MTU Aero Engines is suspending operations at several facilities – initially Munich and Rzeszow, where engine components are produced – for three weeks from 30 March, citing “unstable material supply”. Without mentioning MTU specifically, Faury has expressed frustration over a three-week interruption to the supply chain, claiming that the situation was “not co-ordinated” and that Airbus will need to discuss the implications. But he also points out that the airframer had already been stockpiling and preparing as part of its measures to cope with the UK's withdrawal from the European Union, and that this could offer “headroom” regarding the supply chain. Airbus has previously stepped in to support financially suppliers which have been under pressure, but Faury says that consideration of any such measure in the current situation is “premature”, although the company is “monitoring very closely” its suppliers.",3,430,0.0,0.2713,"order, business, jet, delivery, production, customer, deliver, commercial, quarter, include","['evaluate', 'potential', 'impact', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'production', 'particularly', 'twinaisle', 'acknowledges', 'might', 'store', 'tighten', 'restriction', 'obstruct', 'delivery', 'airframer', 'emphasise', 'retains', 'strong', 'backlog', 'especially', 'singleaisle', 'sector', 'help', 'reduce', 'adverse', 'effect', 'business', 'chief', 'executive', 'guillaume', 'faury', 'speak', 'march', 'briefing', 'say', 'twinaisle', 'market', 'already', 'deal', 'oversupply', 'situation', 'say', 'action', 'transport', 'industry', 'outbreak', 'likely', 'result', 'far', 'oversupply', 'airframer', 'take', 'decision', 'base', 'onebyone', 'discussion', 'customer', 'faury', 'drawn', 'overall', 'effect', 'delivery', 'extent', 'production', 'might', 'trim', 'try', 'deny', 'obvious', 'say', 'add', 'lot', 'consequence', 'state', 'need', 'take', 'ass', 'adapt', 'part', 'reason', 'unveil', 'credit', 'package', 'enhance', 'liquidity', 'suspend', 'production', 'temporarily', 'initially', 'france', 'spain', 'since', 'restore', 'put', 'priority', 'flow', 'say', 'faury', 'rather', 'take', 'step', 'necessary', 'achieve', 'stability', 'reasonable', 'level', 'activity', 'say', 'increasingly', 'tight', 'restriction', 'travel', 'put', 'lot', 'additional', 'difficulty', 'delivery', 'effort', 'manage', 'keep', 'certain', 'flow', 'airframer', 'look', 'possibility', 'store', 'complete', 'delivery', 'february', 'slightly', 'previous', 'despite', 'longer', 'month', 'widebodies', 'hand', 'chief', 'financial', 'officer', 'dominik', 'asam', 'say', 'march', 'figure', 'tough', 'although', 'coronavirus', 'emerge', 'around', 'supplier', 'faury', 'say', 'disruption', 'chinese', 'supply', 'chain', 'week', 'month', 'admits', 'situation', 'become', 'increasingly', 'complex', 'outbreak', 'spread', 'europe', 'usa', 'anticipate', 'difficulty', 'german', 'manufacturer', 'mtu', 'aero', 'engine', 'suspend', 'operation', 'several', 'facility', 'initially', 'munich', 'rzeszow', 'engine', 'component', 'produce', 'week', 'march', 'cite', 'unstable', 'material', 'supply', 'without', 'mention', 'mtu', 'specifically', 'faury', 'express', 'frustration', 'threeweek', 'interruption', 'supply', 'chain', 'claim', 'situation', 'coordinate', 'need', 'discus', 'implication', 'point', 'airframer', 'already', 'stockpile', 'prepare', 'part', 'measure', 'cope', 'uk', 'withdrawal', 'european', 'union', 'offer', 'headroom', 'regard', 'supply', 'chain', 'previously', 'step', 'support', 'financially', 'supplier', 'pressure', 'faury', 'say', 'consideration', 'measure', 'current', 'situation', 'premature', 'although', 'monitoring', 'closely', 'supplier']"

The UAE's National Emergency Crisis and Disasters Management Authority (NCEMA) and General Civil Aviation Authority (GCAA) has announced that passenger flights to, from and through the country will be suspended from 25 March for a period of two weeks, in order to “curb the spread of the Covid-19”. Freight and emergency evacuation flights will still be permitted to operate. The suspension affects major global hubs in Dubai and Abu Dhabi.

"Singapore Airlines will slash schedules and ground almost all aircraft, as the coronavirus pandemic presents “the greatest challenge that the SIA Group has faced in its existence”. Due to the further tightening of border controls globally, SIA will cut 96% of scheduled capacity until end-April and ground 138 of 147 aircraft operated by SIA and regional carrier, SilkAir. Low-cost unit Scoot will also suspend most of its network and ground all but two of its 49 aircraft. Singapore is also banning short-term visitors from entering or transiting through the city state, effective 23 March 11:59, in an attempt to reduce the number of imported coronavirus cases. The carrier said today: “The SIA Group diversified its network and set up Scoot to spread its risks and cater to a wide range of passenger and market segments. However, without a domestic segment, the group's airlines become more vulnerable when international markets increasingly restrict the free movement of people or ban air travel altogether. “It is unclear when the SIA Group can begin to resume normal services, given the uncertainty as to when the stringent border controls will be lifted. “The resultant collapse in the demand for air travel has led to a significant decline in SIA's passenger revenues.”  The company reiterates that it is “taking steps to build up its liquidity, and to reduce capital expenditure and operating costs” and will “aggressively pursue all measures to address the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak on the company”. This includes salary and fee cuts for SIA Group's management and directors, and a voluntary no-pay leave scheme for staff up to a certain level of seniority. “Given the worsening situation, the unions have been engaged on the additional cost-cutting measures that are needed and more steps will be taken imminently,” it says. The company is also in discussions with aircraft manufacturers to defer upcoming aircraft deliveries. “If agreed, this will consequently defer payment for those aircraft deliveries.” The group has, over the last few days, drawn on its lines of credits to meet immediate cash flow requirements. “The SIA Group is engaging in discussions with several financial institutions for its future funding requirements.” It adds: “The company continues to explore measures to shore up its liquidity during this unprecedented disruption to global air travel. The company will release further details when such measures have been firmed up.” Cirium fleets data shows that Singapore Airlines has 68 aircraft in its orderbook, comprising 20 Boeing 777-9s, 29 787-10s, and 19 A350s.

"Virgin Australia and Qantas expect further changes to their schedules after the Australian government advised against domestic travel to slow the spread of the coronavirus. Virgin Australia said in statement to the stock exchange today: “The Virgin Australia Group acknowledges the additional Covid-19 related travel restrictions announced by the federal and state governments on Sunday 22 March 2020 and expects a material reduction in its domestic capacity as a result.” The airline had on 18 March already announced plans to suspend all international flying from 30 March to 14 June 2020 and cut domestic capacity by 50% until 14 June 2020. After closing borders to non-residents last week, Australia moved on 22 March to tighten restrictions on domestic travel. Prime minster Scott Morrison said at a press conference: “After consulting premiers and chief ministers overnight, we have decided that we are moving immediately to recommend against all non-essential travel in Australia. So that is that all non-essential travel should be cancelled.” Qantas, the country's largest carrier, says it will also alter schedules as required. “We'll continue to adjust Qantas and Jetstar services as needed in light of the latest advice and restrictions from the federal, state and territory governments on non-essential travel,” it said via Twitter on 22 March after the new advice was announced. Virgin Australia, which had on 13 March described domestic travel as a “bright spot”, adds it will provide more information in the coming days. Australia's move follows similar advice from New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern, who on Saturday advised New Zealanders to limit non-essential domestic travel.

"S&P Global has lowered its ratings for EasyJet, Ryanair, Lufthansa, IAG, British Airways, Air Baltic, Turkish Airlines and SAS, and placed them on alert for further downgrades as the coronavirus hurts their liquidity positions. “The pandemic materially threatens the credit quality of European airlines and poses serious challenges for the global airline industry as a whole,” states the ratings agency. It warns that “lower revenues and cash flows will result in significantly weaker credit metrics in 2020 than our previous expectations”. Given the collapsing passenger demand and the significant travel restrictions being enacted in Europe and worldwide, S&P believes earnings could fall by 50-70% depending on carriers' abilities to slash costs. The agency expects revenue to decline 30% on the back of softer average ticket prices as carriers lower their yields in order to fill seats. Capacity will only be reduced by half as much as passenger demand falls, S&P suggests, amid airlines' efforts to maintain viable flight schedules. A gradual recovery in passenger demand is forecast for the third quarter and near-normal trading conditions for the fourth, but it will likely be hindered by a global recession. “The ultimate impact of the coronavirus outbreak will depend on its duration and severity, and the type and rigorousness of measures airlines and government bodies take to mitigate it,” says S&P. Given this uncertainty, its forecasts “are susceptible to possible revisions in the near term”. Although the overall outlook for airlines is sharply negative, their cash positions will benefit from weaker fuel costs, the deferral of capital expenditure on new aircraft, and the suspension of dividends and share buybacks.",3,434,3.0,0.2369,"passenger, loss, operating, revenue, traffic, month, increase, capacity, decline, result","['p', 'global', 'lower', 'rating', 'easyjet', 'ryanair', 'lufthansa', 'iag', 'british', 'airway', 'baltic', 'turkish', 'sa', 'place', 'alert', 'far', 'downgrade', 'coronavirus', 'hurt', 'liquidity', 'position', 'pandemic', 'materially', 'threatens', 'credit', 'quality', 'european', 'pose', 'serious', 'challenge', 'global', 'industry', 'whole', 'state', 'rating', 'agency', 'warns', 'low', 'revenue', 'cash', 'flow', 'result', 'significantly', 'weaker', 'credit', 'metric', 'previous', 'expectation', 'give', 'collapse', 'passenger', 'demand', 'significant', 'travel', 'restriction', 'enact', 'europe', 'worldwide', 'p', 'believe', 'earnings', 'fall', 'depend', 'carrier', 'ability', 'slash', 'cost', 'agency', 'expect', 'revenue', 'decline', 'back', 'softer', 'average', 'ticket', 'price', 'carrier', 'low', 'yield', 'order', 'fill', 'seat', 'capacity', 'reduce', 'half', 'much', 'passenger', 'demand', 'fall', 'p', 'suggests', 'amid', 'effort', 'maintain', 'viable', 'schedule', 'gradual', 'recovery', 'passenger', 'demand', 'forecast', 'third', 'quarter', 'nearnormal', 'trading', 'condition', 'fourth', 'likely', 'hinder', 'global', 'recession', 'ultimate', 'impact', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'depend', 'duration', 'severity', 'type', 'rigorousness', 'measure', 'government', 'body', 'take', 'mitigate', 'say', 'p', 'give', 'uncertainty', 'forecast', 'susceptible', 'possible', 'revision', 'near', 'term', 'although', 'overall', 'outlook', 'sharply', 'negative', 'cash', 'position', 'benefit', 'weaker', 'fuel', 'cost', 'deferral', 'capital', 'expenditure', 'suspension', 'dividend', 'share', 'buyback']"
"The coronavirus pandemic continues disrupting US air traffic control (ATC), with the Federal Aviation Administration now temporarily shutting the New York Air Route Traffic Control Center and New York LaGuardia airport's control tower.

"Operators of Airbus A320-family jets are being ordered to remove disks from certain International Aero Engines V2500 powerplants after an uncontained failure resulted in an aborted A321 take-off. The incident occurred on 18 March, says the US FAA, and involved a high-pressure turbine first-stage disk failure. While the regulator has not confirmed which event spurred the directive, a V2500-powered Vietnam Airlines A321 aborted take-off at Ho Chi Minh City on this date with apparent substantial damage to its starboard engine. The FAA is ordering removal, within five flight cycles, of certain first-stage high-pressure turbine disks – bearing particular part and serial numbers – fitted to various models of V2500 engine. All other affected engine models should have records reviewed within three days to assess whether particular disks have been fitted, and operators should remove these disks if installed.

"Boeing announced several extraordinary measures to help the company through the coronavirus crisis which has left the entire aerospace industry reeling. The Chicago-based aircraft manufacturer says in a statement published on 20 March that chief executive Dave Calhoun and board of directors' chairman Larry Kellner will forgo all pay until the end of the year. Boeing will also suspend dividends and continue to pause share repurchasing plans until further notice. The company had suspended stock buyback programs almost a year ago, following the grounding of its 737 Max aircraft following two deadly crashes that killed 346 people. “Boeing is drawing on all of its resources to sustain operations, support its workforce and customers, and maintain supply chain continuity through the COVID-19 crisis and for the long term,” the company says. Earlier in the week, former Boeing board member Nikki Haley resigned after disagreeing with the aircraft maker's request for a $60 billion government aid package for the aerospace industry, funds the company says will help the industry weather the coronavirus downturn and protect 2.5 million jobs. Boeing's request for aid came the same day President Donald Trump pledged to assist Boeing and other travel-related industries, including the airline sector, which also asked for an aid package of tax relief, grants and loans worth a total of $58 billion. But on Friday, Trump said that he supports imposing stock buyback restrictions on companies that receive financial aid as part of the federal government's coronavirus recovery package. Airlines and Boeing have been criticised for spending billions of dollars repurchasing their own stock during recent boom years. The company was already struggling with the 737 Max grounding when the coronavirus outbreak started.

"Berlin airports operator FBB is insisting that the new Brandenburg hub will open on time, even if the coronavirus crisis disrupts trial runs prior to the inauguration. The operator says the 31 October opening date will be “strictly adhered to”, but it acknowledges that there are aspects of the testing which need consideration in order to maintain the deadline. “It will be possible to cope with reduced or postponed individual trial runs,” it states, given the expected lower-than-forecast traffic volumes. Passenger numbers at its Tegel and Schonefeld airports are currently down by some 75%, it states, and is likely to fall further. As a consequence, FBB says it will be “temporarily dependent” on financial aid, and has discussed the matter with its shareholders – although it has yet to assess the extent of any assistance. “Our income situation has deteriorated sharply in the last three weeks,” says chief executive Engelbert Daldrup. “We have to make massive cost savings and reduce operating expenses.” He says the company is subjecting all investments, expenses and appointments to “close scrutiny”, adding that reductions in working hours are necessary. “We must face the additional challenges of the corona crisis, which will place even greater demands on us in terms of human resources and finances than ever before,” says FBB supervisory board chair Rainer Bretschneider. But he points out that the company has agreed a business plan to take the company beyond Brandenburg's opening, budgeting a total of €792 million in funding for 2021-24.

"Flight activity in European airspace has deteriorated by more than 50% compared with the same point last year, the latest data from air navigation organisation Eurocontrol reveals. The average daily number of flights for March 2019 reached 27,362. But the daily figure sank below the halfway point on 18 March – when Eurocontrol recorded 13,769 flights – and the situation worsened further on 19 March when the reduction deepened to 12,670, an overall fall of 56%. Countries being particularly hard-hit by the fall in flights, and therefore facing the impact of lost air navigation revenues, include Italy, Latvia and Moldova – all of which experienced a 87-90% traffic reduction on 19 March, the Eurocontrol data shows. The declines for France and Spain on the same date were around 63%, while the figures for Germany and the UK were 56% and 42% respectively. Ireland was the least affected, with a fall of less than 25%. Lufthansa's services were down 77% on 19 March while Austrian's were almost completely eliminated. IAG fared better with British Airways down by 49% and Iberia by 72%, while Air France and KLM respectively fell by 60% and 55%.

"Two stalwarts of the European summer aerospace event calendar – the Farnborough air show and Royal International Air Tattoo (RIAT) – have become the latest to confirm their cancellation due to the coronavirus pandemic. The organisers of both UK events announced their decisions on 20 March, citing the effect of the Covid-19 outbreak and resulting restrictions on public gatherings. “After very careful consideration, the unprecedented impact of the global coronavirus pandemic has forced this decision in the interests of the health and safety of our exhibitors, visitors, contractors and staff,” says show organiser Farnborough International. “Several major factors surrounding the outbreak...make it impossible for us to create and host the air show,” it adds. The event had been due to take place at the Hampshire site from 20-24 July; the organiser last year opted to end hosting public displays over the subsequent weekend. “We understand this news will be an incredible disappointment to all across the international aerospace industry, not to mention our important exhibitors, suppliers and visitors,” Farnborough International says. “But rest assured, we are determined to continue to work together and will ensure the Farnborough International Airshow returns in 2022 better than ever.” Meanwhile, the organisers of RIAT – which was to have taken place at RAF Fairford in Gloucestershire from 17-19 July – says the current global health emergency represents a “challenging and unprecedented environment...worsening by the day”. “The Air Tattoo is reliant on the support of a wide range of stakeholders, not least the participation of international air arms, medical professionals, military security teams and our emergency services, many of whom are delivering a fundamental contribution to fighting this crisis. We believe delivery of our event would distract them from this,” they say. The event will return in 2021, with the event to mark the Air Tattoo's 50thanniversary. Multiple aerospace-themed events around the globe have now been cancelled as a result of the coronavirus spread and its huge impact on the airline industry. Others to have already been axed within recent weeks include the Aircraft Interiors Expo, Aero Friedrichshafen and ILA Berlin air show in Germany, EBACE in Switzerland, Chile's FIDAE and major US military gatherings including the Navy League's Sea-Air-Space show and the Army Aviation Association of America's 2020 Summit.",3,441,2.0,0.3054,"executive, chief, cut, add, situation, staff, crisis, make, coronavirus, employee","['stalwart', 'european', 'summer', 'event', 'calendar', 'farnborough', 'royal', 'international', 'tattoo', 'riat', 'become', 'late', 'confirm', 'cancellation', 'due', 'coronavirus', 'pandemic', 'organiser', 'uk', 'event', 'announce', 'decision', 'march', 'cite', 'effect', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'result', 'restriction', 'public', 'gathering', 'careful', 'consideration', 'unprecedented', 'impact', 'global', 'coronavirus', 'pandemic', 'force', 'decision', 'interest', 'health', 'safety', 'exhibitor', 'visitor', 'contractor', 'staff', 'say', 'organiser', 'farnborough', 'international', 'several', 'major', 'factor', 'surround', 'outbreak', 'make', 'impossible', 'u', 'create', 'host', 'add', 'event', 'due', 'take', 'place', 'hampshire', 'site', 'july', 'organiser', 'opt', 'end', 'host', 'public', 'display', 'subsequent', 'weekend', 'understand', 'news', 'incredible', 'disappointment', 'across', 'international', 'industry', 'mention', 'important', 'exhibitor', 'supplier', 'visitor', 'farnborough', 'international', 'say', 'rest', 'assure', 'determine', 'continue', 'work', 'together', 'ensure', 'farnborough', 'international', 'airshow', 'return', 'well', 'meanwhile', 'organiser', 'riat', 'take', 'place', 'raf', 'fairford', 'gloucestershire', 'july', 'say', 'current', 'global', 'health', 'emergency', 'represent', 'challenge', 'unprecedented', 'environment', 'worsen', 'day', 'tattoo', 'reliant', 'support', 'wide', 'range', 'stakeholder', 'least', 'participation', 'international', 'arm', 'medical', 'professional', 'military', 'security', 'team', 'emergency', 'service', 'many', 'deliver', 'fundamental', 'contribution', 'fight', 'crisis', 'believe', 'delivery', 'event', 'distract', 'say', 'event', 'return', 'event', 'mark', 'tattoo', 'multiple', 'aerospacethemed', 'event', 'around', 'globe', 'cancel', 'result', 'coronavirus', 'spread', 'huge', 'impact', 'industry', 'others', 'already', 'axed', 'within', 'recent', 'week', 'include', 'interior', 'expo', 'aero', 'friedrichshafen', 'ila', 'berlin', 'germany', 'ebace', 'switzerland', 'chile', 'fidae', 'major', 'u', 'military', 'gathering', 'include', 'navy', 'league', 'seaairspace', 'army', 'association', 'america', 'summit']"
"Volotea has announced the temporary grounding of its entire fleet until at least 8 April, sending home 1,100 of its employees in Spain, France and Italy over this period. The Spanish airline says the grounding of its fleet of 19 Airbus A319s and 14 Boeing 717s jets is a consequence of both the collapse of demand for air transport amid the coronavirus outbreak and the national curfews and regulations limiting air traffic, such as the virtual prohibition of passenger flights to the Balearic Islands, except for tourist repatriation flights. Volotea, Spain's fourth-largest airline, is offering customers booked on the cancelled flights the option to chose between a refund or a voucher worth 120% of the ticket price paid. This news comes a day after local market leader Iberia announced that it will temporarily lay off nearly 14.000 of its employees. Volotea, which recently relocated its headquarters from Barcelona to Oviedo, specialises on point-to-point routes between southern European mid-sized cities often not served by other airlines. Of its 13 operational bases, only two are located in its home country. Six are in France and five in Italy. However, the airline has agreed to acquire part of Iberia's domestic network, ahead of the planned acquisition of Air Europa by the Spanish flag carrier's parent IAG.",3,442,12.0,0.1754,"travel, government, country, coronavirus, measure, restriction, passenger, state, march, canada","['volotea', 'announce', 'temporary', 'ground', 'entire', 'fleet', 'least', 'april', 'send', 'home', 'employee', 'spain', 'france', 'italy', 'period', 'spanish', 'say', 'ground', 'fleet', 'jet', 'consequence', 'collapse', 'demand', 'transport', 'amid', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'national', 'curfew', 'regulation', 'limit', 'traffic', 'virtual', 'prohibition', 'passenger', 'balearic', 'island', 'except', 'tourist', 'repatriation', 'volotea', 'spain', 'fourthlargest', 'offering', 'customer', 'book', 'cancel', 'option', 'chose', 'refund', 'voucher', 'worth', 'ticket', 'price', 'paid', 'news', 'come', 'day', 'local', 'market', 'leader', 'iberia', 'announce', 'temporarily', 'lay', 'nearly', 'employee', 'volotea', 'recently', 'relocate', 'headquarters', 'barcelona', 'oviedo', 'specialises', 'pointtopoint', 'route', 'southern', 'european', 'midsized', 'city', 'often', 'serve', 'operational', 'base', 'locate', 'home', 'country', 'france', 'italy', 'however', 'agree', 'acquire', 'part', 'iberia', 'domestic', 'network', 'ahead', 'plan', 'acquisition', 'europa', 'spanish', 'flag', 'carrier', 'parent', 'iag']"
"South African Airways is immediately cancelling all international services until the end of May. Operations will continue on some of SAA's domestic and regional routes, although the majority were cancelled in recent days. South Africa has declared a “state of disaster” in response to the coronavirus outbreak and placed restrictions on travellers from “high-risk” countries, including the USA, UK, and Germany – three of SAA's most popular destination markets. “In support of efforts by government to deal with this pandemic, and in the best interests of our crew, passengers and the public, we have decided to suspend all international flights until 31 May 2020,” states SAA acting chief executive Zuks Ramasia. “It is all our responsibility, not just government's, to curb further transmission of the virus. In addition, the increasing risks to our crew of contracting the virus, including the possibility of being trapped in foreign destinations as a consequence of increasing travel bans, cannot be ignored.” The operator is being run by “business rescue practitioners” while a turnaround plan is drawn up. It operates a mix of Airbus A319s, A320s, A330s, A340s, A350s and Boeing 737s. On 19 March, IATA appealed to governments in Africa and the Middle East to provide emergency support to airlines, noting that many routes had been suspended and others had been hit by demand drops of up to 60%. The association estimates that the Afircan air transport industry contributes $55.8 billion to the continent's economy and supports 6.2 million jobs. State-owned regional carrier SA Express, which has been operating under business rescue practioners since entering formal restructuring in February, suspended services until further notice on 18 March. While it cited coronavirus as a factor, it indicated this was only one consideration behind its decision, attributing the suspension to “adverse recent developments”.",3,443,8.0,0.2255,"government, uk, carrier, business, state, share, south, airway, financial, plan","['south', 'african', 'airway', 'immediately', 'cancel', 'international', 'service', 'end', 'may', 'operation', 'continue', 'saa', 'domestic', 'regional', 'route', 'although', 'majority', 'cancel', 'recent', 'day', 'south', 'africa', 'declare', 'state', 'disaster', 'response', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'place', 'restriction', 'traveller', 'highrisk', 'country', 'include', 'usa', 'uk', 'germany', 'saa', 'popular', 'destination', 'market', 'support', 'effort', 'government', 'deal', 'pandemic', 'best', 'interest', 'crew', 'passenger', 'public', 'decide', 'suspend', 'international', 'may', 'state', 'saa', 'act', 'chief', 'executive', 'zuks', 'ramasia', 'responsibility', 'government', 'curb', 'far', 'transmission', 'virus', 'addition', 'increase', 'risk', 'crew', 'contract', 'virus', 'include', 'possibility', 'trap', 'foreign', 'destination', 'consequence', 'increase', 'travel', 'ban', 'operator', 'run', 'business', 'rescue', 'practitioner', 'turnaround', 'plan', 'drawn', 'operates', 'mix', 'march', 'iata', 'appeal', 'government', 'africa', 'middle', 'east', 'provide', 'emergency', 'support', 'note', 'many', 'route', 'suspend', 'others', 'hit', 'demand', 'drop', 'association', 'estimate', 'afircan', 'transport', 'industry', 'contributes', 'continent', 'economy', 'support', 'job', 'stateowned', 'regional', 'carrier', 'sa', 'express', 'operating', 'business', 'rescue', 'practioners', 'since', 'enter', 'formal', 'restructuring', 'february', 'suspend', 'service', 'far', 'notice', 'march', 'cite', 'coronavirus', 'factor', 'indicate', 'consideration', 'behind', 'decision', 'attribute', 'suspension', 'adverse', 'recent', 'development']"

"Cathay Pacific has extended its deep capacity cuts for another month, reducing capacity by 96% for April and May, operating a “bare skeleton” passenger flight schedule of just 15 cities. With the latest cuts, Cathay will fly three-times-weekly to 12 points in its network to cities such as Singapore, London Heathrow, Bangkok, Vancouver, as well as Sydney. Subsidiary Cathay Dragon will operate thrice-weekly flights to three points: Beijing, Shanghai Pudong and Kuala Lumpur. Still, the carrier warned that the cuts could go further, depending on government-imposed travel restrictions that have in recent days been growing. As with other regional carriers, Cathay's slashing of capacity is in response to weakened travel demand from the coronavirus outbreak, as well as a growing list of government travel restrictions. The carrier states: “Our ability to maintain even this skeleton schedule will depend on whether more travel restrictions are imposed by governments around the world which will further dampen passenger demand.” Cathay chief customer and commercial officer Ronald Lam adds: “We have no choice but to significantly reduce our passenger capacity as travel restrictions are making it increasingly difficult for our customers to travel and demand has dropped drastically.” The carrier previously warned in its February traffic results that capacity cuts could extend into May, if travel restrictions were not relaxed by then. It earlier announced that April will see 90% of capacity cut from the passenger network. On the cargo front, Lam says the airline is ramping up capacity by mounting charter services. Cathay will also operate suspended passenger services as freight-only flights, to meet customer demand. Its cargo schedules for April and May remain intact. Cathay has warned of a substantial loss for the first half of the year, as it was hit by the double-whammy of political unrest and the coronavirus outbreak. In its February traffic results, it stated that it was made an unaudited loss of more than HK$2 billion ($257 million) for the month. Separately, Cathay low-cost unit HK Express announced that it will suspend all operations until end-April, citing a drop in demand and growing travel restrictions. The carrier, which flies to 25 cities in the region, states it was looking to resume flights in May, but will monitor the situation closely. It states: “HK Express has already taken a number of measures to help it preserve cash, including cost containment, recruitment suspension, supplier management and the implementation of the special no pay leave scheme to mitigate the financial impact of the situation on the company.” HK Express chief Mandy Ng adds: “It is now essential in order to ensure we see ourselves through this extremely difficult period.

"The Association of Asia Pacific Airlines (AAPA) has called on the region's governments to “take immediate action” to help airlines amid the coronavirus pandemic. It notes that travel bans, border closures, lockdowns, quarantines, and other measures will see Asian airlines suffer revenue shortfalls of $60 billion in 2020. “By the same token many of the one million workers employed in the Asia Pacific airline industry are unable to work because of the drastic reductions in operations,” it says. “Many are facing the threat of a loss of their livelihoods.” One impact of major capacity cuts is a lack of cargo capacity, which AAPA says has drastically affect supply chains for items such as food and medical supplies. The AAPA lists four measures governments can take to assist airlines: “Airlines have been taking tough but necessary steps to deal with the current crisis by sharply reducing operations and costs including discussions with staff members whilst trying to preserve jobs,” it says. “Airlines are also actively seeking additional financing from banks and financial institutions. Such measures will, however, not be sufficient to guarantee the survival of the aviation sector.” The AAPA's members comprise Air Astana, All Nippon Airways, Asiana Airlines, Bangkok Airways, Cathay Pacific Aireways, China Airlines, EVA Air, Garuda Indonesia, Japan Airlines, Korean Air, Malaysia Airlines, Philippine Airlines, Royal Brunei Airlines, Singapore Airlines, and Thai Airways.",3,446,5.0,0.1786,"carrier, march, international, outbreak, suspend, capacity, schedule, april, united, coronavirus","['association', 'asia', 'pacific', 'aapa', 'call', 'region', 'government', 'take', 'immediate', 'action', 'help', 'amid', 'coronavirus', 'pandemic', 'note', 'travel', 'ban', 'border', 'closure', 'lockdown', 'quarantine', 'measure', 'see', 'asian', 'suffer', 'revenue', 'shortfall', 'token', 'many', 'worker', 'employ', 'asia', 'pacific', 'industry', 'unable', 'work', 'drastic', 'reduction', 'operation', 'say', 'many', 'face', 'threat', 'loss', 'impact', 'major', 'capacity', 'cut', 'lack', 'cargo', 'capacity', 'aapa', 'say', 'drastically', 'affect', 'supply', 'chain', 'item', 'food', 'medical', 'supply', 'aapa', 'list', 'measure', 'government', 'take', 'assist', 'take', 'tough', 'necessary', 'step', 'deal', 'current', 'crisis', 'sharply', 'reduce', 'operation', 'cost', 'include', 'discussion', 'staff', 'member', 'whilst', 'try', 'preserve', 'job', 'say', 'actively', 'seek', 'additional', 'financing', 'bank', 'financial', 'institution', 'measure', 'however', 'sufficient', 'guarantee', 'survival', 'aapa', 'member', 'comprise', 'astana', 'nippon', 'airway', 'asiana', 'bangkok', 'airway', 'cathay', 'pacific', 'aireways', 'eva', 'garuda', 'indonesia', 'japan', 'korean', 'malaysia', 'philippine', 'royal', 'brunei', 'singapore', 'thai', 'airway']"
"Air New Zealand has secured standby funding of up to NZ$900 million ($511 million) from the government to support the airline as it battles the coronavirus outbreak. The government, which owns 52% of the airline, said on 20 March that the deal allows the carrier to keep operating and will protect essential routes. The carrier can call on the loan should its cash reserves fall below a minimum threshold. “Without this intervention, New Zealand was at risk of not having a national airline,” finance minister Grant Robertson said in a statement. New Zealand tightened its travel restrictions on Thursday, closing its borders to non-citizens and those without permanent residency. Many other countries worldwide have also implemented travel restrictions, decimating demand and forcing airlines to ground planes. The airline had already announced major capacity cuts, including 85% of its long-haul network, on March 16, and warned of redundancies. The domestic network has been safeguarded by the loan deal, the government said today. Robertson added that the government was working with Air New Zealand to help affected employees, such as by redeploying staff to help with the medical response to the crisis. “While today's action means the company can continue to operate, given the unprecedented shock to the global aviation industry caused by Covid-19, Air New Zealand has advised that there will unfortunately be job losses as capacity is cut,” he noted. The carrier says in the latest statement it is now working with the government to maintain key services, such as cargo and repatriation flights. “Those services will be provided for under separate commercial arrangements to be negotiated in the future on an arms' length basis between the airline and the government.” It adds that it is “greatly appreciative” of the loan. Chairman Therese Walsh says in a statement: “The government and treasury moved swiftly to ensure that Air New Zealand had financial certainty as demand for flights domestically and internationally has rapidly fallen due to travel restrictions implemented by countries around the world.” As part of the conditions for the government help, Air New Zealand cancelled an interim dividend totalling NZ$123 million that it announced on 27 February and will not make further payments to shareholders while the loan is available.

"Hawaiian Airlines plans to cut 40% of its flights in April, including international routes and those to the continental USA, as the carrier prepares for a prolonged lack of demand and additional government travel restrictions in response to the coronavirus outbreak. The carrier on 18 March announced it will halt nonstop service between Honolulu and Tahiti due to new arrival restrictions by the French Polynesian government. The last flight from Honolulu to Tahiti will be on 21 March, but the carrier is scheduling service to resume in May. Australia and New Zealand have also imposed travel restrictions, so Hawaiian has already suspended service between Honolulu and Auckland through May, while service from Honolulu to Sydney and Brisbane is suspended through April. Hawaiian is also making additional cuts to its Japan network. The carrier will operate six weekly nonstop flights between Honolulu and Osaka's Kansai airport from 6 April 6-28, scaling back from daily service. It will also scale back from four to three weekly nonstop flights between Honolulu and Fukuoka between 5 April and 1 June. Frequencies of flights within the USA will be limited but the carrier will maintain service with the mainland. As of 1 April, nonstop service will be suspended between Maui and Las Vegas, but Hawaiian will continue daily nonstop flights to the Nevada city from Honolulu. During April the carrier will operate only one daily nonstop flight between Honolulu and the cities of Seattle and San Francisco. Hawaiian plans to reduce frequencies between neighbouring islands where demand is lowest, while connecting the islands with 100 daily flights during April.

"Due to lack of demand for passenger transportation, American Airlines plans to start flying scheduled cargo-only flights. The first cargo-only flight is to depart from Dallas/Fort Worth International airport on 20 March and will land at Frankfurt International airport the next morning, says the company on 19 March. The Boeing 777-300 will operate two round trips between the airports over the course of four days.  The trips represent the first scheduled cargo-only fights since 1984 when American retired the last of its Boeing 747 freighters, says the Fort Worth-based airline. “Challenging times call for creative solutions, and a team of people across the airline has been working nonstop to arrange cargo-only flight options for our customers,” says Rick Elieson, president of cargo and vice-president of international operations. American also points out that airlines are “deemed a critical infrastructure industry by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.” On Thursday, the US Senate drafted a bill that would provide passenger and cargo carriers $58 billion in collateralised loans and loan guarantees, including $8 billion reserved for cargo carriers. Industry lobby groups had earlier requested a mix of grants, loans and tax breaks to alleviate the financial pain inflicted by the traffic fallout from the coronavirus. American has cut more than 75% of its international capacity in recent days. The 777-300 has 14 cargo positions for large pallets and can carry more than 45,400kg (100,000lb). The four scheduled flights this weekend are expected to be booked to capacity, says American.

"The US Department of State has issued a “Level 4” international travel advisory, upping the government's travel warning to the highest level and urging Americans not to travel internationally. The Level 4 advisory, which carries the “Do Not Travel” recommendation, comes in response to the coronavirus pandemic, the agency says. “In countries where commercial departure options remain available, US citizens who live in the United States should arrange for immediate return to the United States, unless they are prepared to remain abroad for an indefinite period. US citizens who live abroad should avoid all international travel,” says the warning. ”If you choose to travel internationally, your travel plans may be severely disrupted, and you may be forced to remain outside of the United States for an indefinite timeframe.” The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for confirmation from FlightGlobal. Level 4 advisories signify “likelihood of life-threatening risks” and likely inability of the US government to assist overseas citizens. The agency had already, on 15 March, issued a Level 3 advisory applying to all international travel. That advisory recommends US citizens “reconsider travel abroad due to the global impact of COVID-19”.

"The air traffic control tower at Las Vegas McCarran International airport has been closed for a deep cleaning after one controller has “presumptively tested positive” for the coronavirus. The airport remains open, but with reduced flight operations until the situation can be resolved, the Federal Aviation Administration says on 19 March. A Notice to Airmen published early on Thursday says the control tower will remain closed until 27 March. “With the tower temporarily closed, the Las Vegas Terminal Radar Approach Control has assumed control of the tower's airspace,” the FAA says in a statement. The regulatory body says it is determining how many air traffic controllers will need to self-isolate after being exposed to the individual who likely has the virus. Southwest Airlines is the biggest operator from McCarran, with three times the number of flights to and from the airport than its closest competitor, Spirit Airlines, Cirium schedules data show. The Dallas-based carrier says it has reduced operations at the airport, and so far it has had to cancel 130 flights. FlightAware.com says inbound flights are currently being delayed at origin an average of 6h 37min. Earlier this week, ATC closed the tower at Chicago's Midway International airport after three members of staff tested positive for coronavirus. A new Notice to Airmen, published late Wednesday, says the tower will remain closed until 18 April. Attempts to reach the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, the labor union for ATC employees, were unsuccessful. Las Vegas was placed under a “shelter-in-place” order on Wednsday, closing all non-essential business, including casinos and restaurants - the main drivers of the city's economy - to prevent further coronavirus spread.

"Swiss International Air Lines is considering a full suspension of flights, following the lead of other carriers within Lufthansa Group, which as a whole has shed 95% of its planned capacity. The Zurich-based airline says it has grounded more than two-thirds of its fleet and reduced flight operations 80% in the past few weeks because of the “draconian travel restrictions and border closures”.  Chief executive Thomas Kluhr states that Swiss intends to “maintain a minimum number of routes for as long as we can, to ensure that when the crisis does abate, we can resume our services to those countries which reopen as swiftly as possible”. But the airline warns: “Should the present situation worsen even further and additional travel prohibitions be imposed, Swiss can no longer rule out suspending all its flight operations.” Kluhr argues a full operational stop would not reflect a “structural issue” of the airline, but be “a response to external developments that are affecting the entire airline industry”. He asserts: “Swiss is essentially a robust and healthy major Swiss company that holds a strong market position as part of the Lufthansa Group”. In 2019, the airline's adjusted EBIT declined to Swfr578 million ($583 million), from Swfr636 million during the previous year. Revenue, at Swfr5.33 billion was broadly in line with that in 2018. Kluhr states that while Swiss can “hold its breath longer than some other European carriers, we will also face a temporary liquidity shortage if the crisis persists over the longer term”. He believes that “all of Europe's airlines will need state support...It's no longer a question of whether: it's a question of when.” Swiss is preparing short-time working for staff and has implemented a hiring freeze, deferred certain salary components and suspended non-essential projects.

"The Federal Aviation Administration has issued an airworthiness directive to address a computer issue that could lead to incorrect flight data being displayed in Boeing 787 cockpits. Its order applies to 787-8s, 787-9s and 787-10s. It requires airlines, within 15 days of 20 March, to complete actions detailed in a February service bulletin issued by Boeing to address the issue.  Cockpit of a Boeing 787-9 The order responds to a report that the 787's “common core system” can experience data monitoring problems after the system has been continuously powered for 51 days. Data monitoring problems can cause issues with the 787's “common data network”, which handles all the flight-critical data, including airspeed, altitude, attitude and engine operation, says the FAA's order. “Several potentially catastrophic failure scenarios can result from this situation,” the order says. Consequences can include display in the cockpit of “misleading” attitude, altitude, airspeed and engine operation data, says the FAA, or the aircraft could lose stall and overspeed warnings. The common core system is the 787's “primary computing environment”, processing avionics data and software applications, according to GE Aviation. The aircraft's common data network lives within the core system and manages information flow between aircraft systems, according to Collins Aerospace documents. Under the FAA order, airlines must comply with a Boeing service bulletin issued on 14 February that describes procedures for “repetitive cycle of the airplane electrical power”. ”We identified a potential scenario in which 787 data transmission could be delayed after many days of continuous airplane power on,” Boeing says, adding that on 16 January it ”recommended mitigating action to 787 customers”. “A permanent fix will be issued in the coming months,” Boeing says.

"Investigators have found that an engine-driven pump's overheating preceded a hydraulic leak before an Iran Air Fokker 100 was forced to land at Tehran Mehrabad with its main landing-gear retracted. Iran's Civil Aviation Organisation found that the aircraft, inbound from Qeshm on 19 March last year, had suffered a series of similar hydraulic problems in the previous three days. Recurring defect reports are generated if a defect emerges four times in 10 flights, says the inquiry. But it states that the crew of the outbound Tehran-Qeshm service, despite experiencing such a problem, had not recorded it in the technical log – meaning that a recurrent defect notification was not issued. The inquiry says the preceding event indicated there was a “hidden failure” in the System 1 hydraulic circuit which had not been detected by aircraft maintenance personnel. No problems had been recorded in the six weeks after the jet (EP-IDG) was released from a C-06 check on 1 February 2019. But hydraulic and engine pump failures started emerging on 16 March, affecting three flights, and again on 19 March when occurrences were noted on two flights, including the outbound Tehran-Qeshm service. During this service the crew noticed an abnormality in the System 1 circuit as the aircraft neared cruise, and opted to switch off, then switch on, the related engine-driven pump – although this was not recommended by the quick-reference handbook. The system appeared to return to normal conditions, says the inquiry, and the crew “did not report the event” in the log. If the occurrence had been recorded, remedial action could have been taken at Qeshm, it adds. As a result the issue was not addressed. The inquiry says a faulty check valve in the hydraulic system resulted in an engine-driven pump overheating, and a hydraulic leak. This resulted in the crew's experiencing problems with extending the main landing-gear during the approach to Tehran. It adds that a seizing of the landing-gear locking mechanism also prevented successful manual extension of the undercarriage. The aircraft landed with its main gear retracted on runway 29L, but none of the occupants was injured.",3,455,6.0,0.3815,"engine, maintenance, fuel, takeoff, result, failure, system, problem, power, issue","['investigator', 'found', 'enginedriven', 'pump', 'overheat', 'precede', 'hydraulic', 'leak', 'iran', 'fokker', 'force', 'land', 'tehran', 'mehrabad', 'main', 'landinggear', 'retract', 'iran', 'civil', 'organisation', 'found', 'inbound', 'qeshm', 'march', 'suffer', 'series', 'similar', 'hydraulic', 'problem', 'previous', 'day', 'recur', 'defect', 'report', 'generate', 'defect', 'emerges', 'say', 'inquiry', 'state', 'crew', 'outbound', 'tehranqeshm', 'service', 'despite', 'experience', 'problem', 'record', 'technical', 'log', 'meaning', 'recurrent', 'defect', 'notification', 'issue', 'inquiry', 'say', 'precede', 'event', 'indicate', 'hidden', 'failure', 'system', 'hydraulic', 'circuit', 'detect', 'maintenance', 'personnel', 'problem', 'record', 'week', 'jet', 'epidg', 'release', 'check', 'february', 'hydraulic', 'engine', 'pump', 'failure', 'start', 'emerge', 'march', 'affect', 'march', 'occurrence', 'note', 'include', 'outbound', 'tehranqeshm', 'service', 'service', 'crew', 'notice', 'abnormality', 'system', 'circuit', 'near', 'cruise', 'opt', 'switch', 'switch', 'related', 'enginedriven', 'pump', 'although', 'recommend', 'quickreference', 'handbook', 'system', 'appear', 'return', 'normal', 'condition', 'say', 'inquiry', 'crew', 'report', 'event', 'log', 'occurrence', 'record', 'remedial', 'action', 'take', 'qeshm', 'add', 'result', 'issue', 'address', 'inquiry', 'say', 'faulty', 'check', 'valve', 'hydraulic', 'system', 'result', 'enginedriven', 'pump', 'overheat', 'hydraulic', 'leak', 'result', 'crew', 'experience', 'problem', 'extend', 'main', 'landinggear', 'approach', 'tehran', 'add', 'seize', 'landinggear', 'lock', 'mechanism', 'prevent', 'successful', 'manual', 'extension', 'undercarriage', 'land', 'main', 'gear', 'retract', 'runway', 'none', 'occupant', 'injured']"
"Canadian investigators have detailed an incident in which an Air Canada Boeing 777-300ER aborted take-off at 110kt after its crew saw that a preceding Embraer 190 had aborted its own take-off roll on the same runway. The 777 had been cleared to line up on Toronto's runway 06L immediately after the Air Canada E190 had been cleared for a 06L take-off to Denver. Some 35s later the tower controller cleared the 777 for take-off, directing the crew to “maintain visual separation”. But as soon as the clearance was transmitted the E190 crew informed that they were rejecting their take-off at the D3 exit, about two-thirds of the way down the 2,955m runway. Transportation Safety Board of Canada says the E190 had sustained a bird-strike at around 135kt, prompting the crew to initiate a high-speed abort. The 777, having been issued the take-off clearance, had reached a maximum speed of 110kt before its crew – having observed that the E190 was still on the runway – aborted their own departure, says the board. Both aircraft vacated the runway, the E190 returning to the terminal and the 777 parking on a taxiway for 45min to allow its brakes to cool before also returning to the terminal. Neither aircraft suffered damage during the 7 March incident, and none of the occupants – 359 on the 777 (C-FJZS) and 87 on the E190 (C-FMZW) – was injured.",3,456,7.0,0.386,"crew, runway, inquiry, land, approach, accident, investigator, captain, incident, pilot","['canadian', 'investigator', 'detailed', 'incident', 'canada', 'aborted', 'takeoff', 'crew', 'saw', 'precede', 'embraer', 'aborted', 'takeoff', 'roll', 'runway', 'clear', 'line', 'toronto', 'runway', 'immediately', 'canada', 'clear', 'takeoff', 'denver', 'later', 'tower', 'controller', 'clear', 'takeoff', 'direct', 'crew', 'maintain', 'visual', 'separation', 'soon', 'clearance', 'transmit', 'crew', 'inform', 'reject', 'takeoff', 'exit', 'twothirds', 'way', 'runway', 'transportation', 'safety', 'board', 'canada', 'say', 'sustain', 'birdstrike', 'around', 'prompt', 'crew', 'initiate', 'highspeed', 'abort', 'issue', 'takeoff', 'clearance', 'reach', 'maximum', 'speed', 'crew', 'observe', 'still', 'runway', 'aborted', 'departure', 'say', 'board', 'vacate', 'runway', 'return', 'terminal', 'parking', 'taxiway', 'allow', 'brake', 'cool', 'return', 'terminal', 'neither', 'suffer', 'damage', 'march', 'incident', 'none', 'occupant', 'cfjzs', 'cfmzw', 'injured']"
"Lufthansa Group is unable to predict how much its profit will fall this year as it confirmed a 95% capacity reduction to battle the coronavirus outbreak. “At present, no one can foresee the consequences,” notes chief executive Carsten Spohr in a statement accompanying 2019 earnings. “We have to counter this extraordinary situation with drastic and sometimes painful measures.” Spohr adds that it is the most challenging crisis in the company's history. “The longer this crisis lasts, the more likely it is that the future of aviation cannot be guaranteed without state aid,” he states, echoing calls by other airlines worldwide for government help through the coming months. Capacity has been reduced to 5% of the original plan and the Lufthansa Group is parking approximately 700 of its 763 aircraft, it says. Lufthansa units Brussels Airlines, Austrian Airlines and Air Dolomiti have already declared that they are suspending operations. The group says Lufthansa itself will discontinue long-haul flying from Munich, leaving long-haul flights only from Frankfurt. Swiss will fly three times a week to Newark. Only a few European metropolitan areas will be served by short-haul flights from Frankfurt, Munich and Zurich, the group adds. Lufthansa says it has so far planned around 140 special relief flights to bring people back home, and others will follow. Freight arm Lufthansa Cargo continues to fly its regular programme, except for mainland China, meaning that its entire freighter fleet of seven Boeing 777Fs, six MD-11Fs and four 777Fs at AeroLogic is still flying. “In addition, the company is currently examining the possibility of using passenger aircraft without passengers as pure cargo aircraft in order to further increase cargo capacity,” it adds. Lufthansa Group had revealed an operating profit of €2 billion ($2.2 billion) for 2019 on 13 March, but would not pay shareholders a dividend in an effort to preserve cash amid the coronavirus crisis. It has disclosed that revenues rose 2.5% to €36.4 billion. Consolidated net profit fell by 44% to €1.2 billion. Unit revenue fell 2.5%, which the group put down to high price pressure amid overcapacity. For the network airlines –Lufthansa, Swiss and Austrian Airlines– adjusted EBIT was down 26% at €1.8 billion. Lufthansa says in its annual report that this was down to “scrapped aircraft” as well as impairment losses on IT projects, and financial claims related to the insolvency of Thomas Cook Group. At Eurowings, the operating loss narrowed 28% to €166 million. This includes €44 million of losses attributable to Eurowings long-haul and Brussels Airlines, which will be reported in the Network Airlines division in 2020, the group says. Lufthansa's executive board members will waive 20% of their basic pay in 2020 and the company says it is looking at using aircraft financing to provide further liquidity to see it through the crisis. Credit Suisse had forecast on 16 March that Lufthansa could make an operating loss of €1.5 billion this year and also advocated for Lufthansa to lease aircraft as a way of improving its cash position over the coming months. Lufthansa says it is seeking to reduce fixed costs by one-third during the crisis, such as by implementing short-term working, asking staff to take unpaid leave, imposing a hiring freeze, and cancelling wet-leases, as well as cutting executive pay. Finance chief Ulrik Svensson states: “Lufthansa Group is financially well-equipped to cope with an extraordinary crisis situation such as the current one.”",3,457,2.0,0.1934,"executive, chief, cut, add, situation, staff, crisis, make, coronavirus, employee","['lufthansa', 'unable', 'predict', 'much', 'profit', 'fall', 'confirm', 'capacity', 'reduction', 'battle', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'present', 'foresee', 'consequence', 'note', 'chief', 'executive', 'carsten', 'spohr', 'statement', 'accompany', 'earnings', 'counter', 'extraordinary', 'situation', 'drastic', 'sometimes', 'painful', 'spohr', 'add', 'challenge', 'crisis', 'history', 'longer', 'crisis', 'likely', 'future', 'guaranteed', 'without', 'state', 'aid', 'state', 'echo', 'call', 'worldwide', 'government', 'help', 'come', 'month', 'capacity', 'reduce', 'original', 'plan', 'lufthansa', 'parking', 'approximately', 'say', 'lufthansa', 'unit', 'brussels', 'austrian', 'dolomiti', 'already', 'declare', 'suspend', 'operation', 'say', 'lufthansa', 'discontinue', 'longhaul', 'fly', 'munich', 'leave', 'longhaul', 'frankfurt', 'swiss', 'fly', 'week', 'newark', 'european', 'metropolitan', 'area', 'serve', 'shorthaul', 'frankfurt', 'munich', 'zurich', 'add', 'lufthansa', 'say', 'far', 'plan', 'around', 'special', 'relief', 'bring', 'people', 'back', 'home', 'others', 'follow', 'freight', 'arm', 'lufthansa', 'cargo', 'continue', 'fly', 'regular', 'programme', 'except', 'mainland', 'meaning', 'entire', 'freighter', 'fleet', 'aerologic', 'still', 'fly', 'addition', 'currently', 'examine', 'possibility', 'use', 'passenger', 'without', 'passenger', 'pure', 'cargo', 'order', 'far', 'increase', 'cargo', 'capacity', 'add', 'lufthansa', 'reveal', 'operating', 'profit', 'march', 'pay', 'shareholder', 'dividend', 'effort', 'preserve', 'cash', 'amid', 'coronavirus', 'crisis', 'disclose', 'revenue', 'rise', 'consolidated', 'net', 'profit', 'fell', 'unit', 'revenue', 'fell', 'put', 'high', 'price', 'pressure', 'amid', 'overcapacity', 'network', 'swiss', 'austrian', 'adjust', 'ebit', 'lufthansa', 'say', 'annual', 'report', 'scrap', 'well', 'impairment', 'loss', 'project', 'financial', 'claim', 'related', 'insolvency', 'thomas', 'cook', 'eurowings', 'operating', 'loss', 'narrow', 'include', 'loss', 'attributable', 'eurowings', 'longhaul', 'brussels', 'report', 'network', 'division', 'say', 'lufthansa', 'executive', 'board', 'member', 'waive', 'basic', 'pay', 'say', 'look', 'use', 'financing', 'provide', 'far', 'liquidity', 'see', 'crisis', 'credit', 'suisse', 'forecast', 'march', 'lufthansa', 'make', 'operating', 'loss', 'advocate', 'lufthansa', 'lease', 'way', 'improve', 'cash', 'position', 'come', 'month', 'lufthansa', 'say', 'seek', 'reduce', 'fix', 'cost', 'onethird', 'crisis', 'implement', 'shortterm', 'work', 'ask', 'staff', 'take', 'unpaid', 'leave', 'impose', 'hire', 'freeze', 'cancel', 'wetleases', 'well', 'cut', 'executive', 'pay', 'finance', 'chief', 'ulrik', 'svensson', 'state', 'lufthansa', 'financially', 'wellequipped', 'cope', 'extraordinary', 'crisis', 'situation', 'current']"
"Leisure firm Thomas Cook Group's collapse resulted in a £481 million drain on the protective Air Travel Trust Fund, leaving the fund with sparse resources, a UK National Audit Office investigation states. While the Civil Aviation Authority expects the fund to remain in surplus, the investigation points out that it had typically been paying out only £10 million annually in the previous five years. Some £310 million of the Thomas Cook costs have been paid out by the trust fund, says the audit office, but it has been left with “relatively limited” resources. The trust fund is designed to offer consumer protection and its income is derived from travel companies which contribute £2.50 per traveller. “The government could face further costs if another travel company collapses in the near future,” the investigation states, although it adds that the government has agreed to stand behind the Air Travel Trust Fund in the event of a shortfall or another company failure. No reference is made to the current coronavirus situation, which only emerged after the investigation was completed. Thomas Cook's failure, in September last year, resulted in a £152 million bill for repatriation and another £412 million cost for refunds and fees – a total of £564 million. The audit office says the Air Travel Trust Fund bore the refund burden as well as £69 million of the repatriation cost, through the Air Travel Organiser's Licence scheme. The government is picking up the £83 million balance of the repatriation cost. It is paying a larger share of the overall repatriation expense than originally estimated, says the audit office, because the CAA underestimated the proportion of the 150,000 customers abroad who were ATOL-protected – resulting in an extra £22 million charge. It also faces a separate £73 million bill arising from the government's legal obligation to meet insolvency costs, including redundancy payments to employees. “Government looks set to foot the bill, with industry off the hook,” says UK parliamentary public accounts committee chair Meg Hillier. “Resources to cover other airlines going bust are now very limited. New regulations are urgently required.” Aircraft availability in the aftermath of the collapse was restricted as a result of the busy summer season and the capacity problems caused by the Boeing 737 Max grounding. The CAA told the investigation that, had the Thomas Cook collapse occurred earlier in the summer, there might not have been enough aircraft available. Using Thomas Cook's own aircraft was a “risky and costly option”, says the investigation, because it would have required the agreement of the liquidator to maintain parts of the company's operation, contrary to its aim of protecting creditors. While the defence ministry had 14 Airbus A330s serving as Voyager transports, nine were on national security deployments and two of the other five were undergoing maintenance. The government was advised that hiring the three available Voyagers would cost £27 million for a month – outside of fuel, crew and other aeronautical costs – and this option was considered “not cost-effective”, says the audit office. Instead the CAA took advantage of call-off contracts with other airlines, and was able to use these contracts and leasing arrangements to put aircraft on standby. It sourced about 150 aircraft from some 50 partners to carry out the repatriation. The audit office says the overall cost of Thomas Cook's collapse to the government remains an estimate and the final cost “may not been known for some time”, because – among other reasons – aircraft lease invoices and charges for handling and other services are still being received. While the government has used the same approach to recover costs as it did during the failure of Monarch Airlines in 2017, the audit office points out that only £2.3 million of the £45 million Monarch cost to the government has been retrieved.",3,458,8.0,0.3139,"government, uk, carrier, business, state, share, south, airway, financial, plan","['leisure', 'firm', 'thomas', 'cook', 'collapse', 'result', 'drain', 'protective', 'travel', 'trust', 'fund', 'leave', 'fund', 'sparse', 'resource', 'uk', 'national', 'audit', 'office', 'investigation', 'state', 'civil', 'authority', 'expect', 'fund', 'remain', 'surplus', 'investigation', 'point', 'typically', 'pay', 'annually', 'previous', 'thomas', 'cook', 'cost', 'paid', 'trust', 'fund', 'say', 'audit', 'office', 'left', 'relatively', 'limited', 'resource', 'trust', 'fund', 'design', 'offer', 'consumer', 'protection', 'income', 'derive', 'travel', 'contribute', 'per', 'traveller', 'government', 'face', 'far', 'cost', 'another', 'travel', 'collapse', 'near', 'future', 'investigation', 'state', 'although', 'add', 'government', 'agree', 'stand', 'behind', 'travel', 'trust', 'fund', 'event', 'shortfall', 'another', 'failure', 'reference', 'make', 'current', 'coronavirus', 'situation', 'emerge', 'investigation', 'complete', 'thomas', 'cook', 'failure', 'september', 'result', 'bill', 'repatriation', 'another', 'cost', 'refund', 'fee', 'total', 'audit', 'office', 'say', 'travel', 'trust', 'fund', 'bore', 'refund', 'burden', 'well', 'repatriation', 'cost', 'travel', 'organiser', 'licence', 'scheme', 'government', 'pick', 'balance', 'repatriation', 'cost', 'pay', 'large', 'share', 'overall', 'repatriation', 'expense', 'originally', 'estimate', 'say', 'audit', 'office', 'caa', 'underestimated', 'proportion', 'customer', 'abroad', 'atolprotected', 'result', 'extra', 'charge', 'face', 'separate', 'bill', 'arise', 'government', 'legal', 'obligation', 'meet', 'insolvency', 'cost', 'include', 'redundancy', 'payment', 'employee', 'government', 'look', 'set', 'foot', 'bill', 'industry', 'hook', 'say', 'uk', 'parliamentary', 'public', 'account', 'committee', 'chair', 'meg', 'hillier', 'resource', 'cover', 'go', 'bust', 'limited', 'regulation', 'urgently', 'availability', 'aftermath', 'collapse', 'restrict', 'result', 'busy', 'summer', 'season', 'capacity', 'problem', 'cause', 'ground', 'caa', 'told', 'investigation', 'thomas', 'cook', 'collapse', 'occur', 'earlier', 'summer', 'might', 'enough', 'available', 'use', 'thomas', 'cook', 'risky', 'costly', 'option', 'say', 'investigation', 'require', 'agreement', 'liquidator', 'maintain', 'part', 'operation', 'contrary', 'aim', 'protect', 'creditor', 'defence', 'ministry', 'serve', 'voyager', 'transport', 'national', 'security', 'deployment', 'undergo', 'maintenance', 'government', 'advise', 'hire', 'available', 'voyager', 'cost', 'month', 'outside', 'fuel', 'crew', 'aeronautical', 'cost', 'option', 'consider', 'costeffective', 'say', 'audit', 'office', 'instead', 'caa', 'take', 'advantage', 'calloff', 'contract', 'able', 'use', 'contract', 'lease', 'arrangement', 'put', 'standby', 'source', 'partner', 'carry', 'repatriation', 'audit', 'office', 'say', 'overall', 'cost', 'thomas', 'cook', 'collapse', 'government', 'remains', 'estimate', 'final', 'cost', 'may', 'know', 'among', 'reason', 'lease', 'invoice', 'charge', 'handle', 'service', 'still', 'receive', 'government', 'use', 'approach', 'recover', 'cost', 'failure', 'monarch', 'audit', 'office', 'point', 'monarch', 'cost', 'government', 'retrieve']"
"US regulators have extended a directive to replace the gearbox and control software of Pratt & Whitney PW1100G engines, to encompass powerplants not used for extended twin-engined operations (ETOPS) flights.

But it is extending the requirement from 21 April to cover non-ETOPS engines. The PW1100G is used on the Airbus A320neo family. Orders to replace the parts follow “multiple” occurrences of in-flight shutdowns resulting from high-cycle fatigue, says the FAA, causing fracture of specific parts within the gearbox assembly.

"February was a difficult month for China's three largest carriers as the country battled the coronavirus outbreak and was the subject of travel restrictions globally. In traffic results released on 18 March, each carrier saw capacity and load factors collapse, both domestically and internationally. As with January's traffic results, regional routes performed the worst, with capacity in come cases falling more than 90% for the period. China saw massive increases in the number of confirmed cases in February, with several cities, including the outbreak epicentre of Wuhan placed on lockdown. Many other countries had also placed restrictions for travel to and from China during the month. Air China carried 1.6 million in February, an 83% decline year-on-year. It was also significantly worse than January's figure of 9.2 million passengers. Regional routes saw the sharpest decline in passengers carried just 36,000 passengers, for a 92% drop year-on-year. Overall RPKs for the month tumbled 80.5%, led mainly by falls in domestic and regional travel. Capacity, measured in ASKs fell 68% across the network. Passenger load factor fell 32.6 percentage points, to 51.4%. Again, regional and domestic load factors saw the largest rate of decrease, at 45.7 and 35.9 percentage points respectively. China Eastern Airlines carried 1.32 million passengers in February, 87.5% down from a year earlier. It also represented a major decrease from January's 10.1 million passengers carried. RPKs for the month tumbled 84%, led by falls in regional traffic. Overall ASKs, meanwhile, fell 72.7%. The SkyTeam carrier's passenger load factor for the month was 50.3%, a drop of 34.2 percentage points. The sharpest declines were recorded in its regional network – at about 44 percentage points lower. As for China Southern Airlines, it carried 1.66 million passengers for the month, an 86.4% decrease compared to February 2019. RPKs across the network fell 85%, while ASKs tumbled 73%. Consequently, passenger load factor for the month came in at 47.1%, a year-on-year decrease of 38.1 percentage points. This was the worst passenger load factor result among the three carriers. The three airlines acknowledged the challenges the coronavirus outbreak posed to their business, but were also quick to take it in their stride, and stress that they would be monitoring the outbreak's development closely. Air China states: “[We] will ...strengthen market research and judgment, optimise the capacity allocation structure, strengthen cost management, focus on risk management and control and take proactive measures to minimise the impact of the epidemic.” Echoing similar sentiments, China Southern says it will “strengthen capacity control and explore market demand to closely track market trends” as it prepares for a possible recovery in the market after the pandemic. China Eastern acknowledged the outbreak's “significant impact”, stating that it had “significantly reduced” passenger travel demand.

"Taiwan has joined a growing list of governments around the world to close off its borders to foreign arrivals, in a bid to stem the tide of imported coronavirus cases. A notice from the ministry of foreign affairs states the travel ban kicks in on 19 March, though exceptions will be made foreign residents of Taiwan, as well as those on diplomatic or official business. However, those exempted from the travel ban must observe a 14-day self-quarantine arrangement upon arrival. The announcement comes as Taiwan sees an uptick in imported cases, despite a slower rate of local transmission. On 17 March, it saw 10 new cases, all of which were by persons returning from overseas travel. The restriction on foreign arrivals will have some impact on Taiwan's carriers.

"Spirit Airlines will cut its April capacity by 20% and its May capacity by 25% and reduce executive salaries as the ultra-low-cost carrier seeks to reduce costs in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Load factors are expected to continue declining through March as governments limit air travel in attempt to halt the spread of the virus, Spirit chief executive Ted Christie says in a 17 March US Securities and Exchange Commission filing. “So far, 10 countries we serve have required airlines to limit or completely stop operations,” Christie says. “As leisure events are cancelled across [the USA], our flown load factor has dropped dramatically over the last week and currently sits about 25% lower than last year.” The Miramar-based carrier has reduced fares “but it isn't enough” to maintain volume, he says. Liquidity is key for airlines during this downturn, and at the end of December, Spirit had $1.1 billion in unrestricted cash. Spirit, like other airlines, says its original full year 2020 guidance should not be relied upon. “Our liquidity and low-cost business model can help us weather this storm, but there are still many unknowns ahead for which we need to prepare,” Christie says. The carrier plans to change some flights from nonstop to a connecting service to adjust for lack of demand, and its executives are also matching the steps taken by other airlines and reducing their salaries. Christie's base salary in 2018 was around $544,000, according to SEC filings, which he says he will reduce by 30% during 2020 as Spirit's other executives also reduce their pay during the downturn. The capacity cuts deepen the 5% reduction Spirit announced in a separate SEC filing on 10 March, a day before the World Health Organization officially declared coronavirus a pandemic. That filing last week projects that the cost per available seat mile excluding fuel is expected to rise 3% during the first quarter, lower than the original expectation of 3.5%-4.5%. Spirit also expects that declining fuel prices will help offset some financial pressure. American Airlines and some other carriers are taking the lack of demand as an opportunity to ground some of their older aircraft, and airlines are in conversations with manufacturers to postpone aircraft deliveries to reduce maintenance and storage expenses. As of 10 March, however, Spirit expects to take delivery of 15 Airbus A320neos during 2020.",3,462,0.0,0.179,"order, business, jet, delivery, production, customer, deliver, commercial, quarter, include","['spirit', 'cut', 'april', 'capacity', 'may', 'capacity', 'reduce', 'executive', 'salary', 'ultralowcost', 'carrier', 'seek', 'reduce', 'cost', 'response', 'coronavirus', 'pandemic', 'load', 'factor', 'expect', 'continue', 'decline', 'march', 'government', 'limit', 'travel', 'attempt', 'halt', 'spread', 'virus', 'spirit', 'chief', 'executive', 'ted', 'christie', 'say', 'march', 'u', 'security', 'exchange', 'commission', 'filing', 'far', 'country', 'serve', 'require', 'limit', 'completely', 'stop', 'operation', 'christie', 'say', 'leisure', 'event', 'cancel', 'across', 'usa', 'flown', 'load', 'factor', 'drop', 'dramatically', 'week', 'currently', 'sits', 'low', 'miramarbased', 'carrier', 'reduce', 'fare', 'enough', 'maintain', 'volume', 'say', 'liquidity', 'key', 'downturn', 'end', 'december', 'spirit', 'unrestricted', 'cash', 'spirit', 'like', 'say', 'original', 'full', 'guidance', 'rely', 'upon', 'liquidity', 'lowcost', 'business', 'model', 'help', 'u', 'weather', 'storm', 'still', 'many', 'unknown', 'ahead', 'need', 'prepare', 'christie', 'say', 'carrier', 'plan', 'change', 'nonstop', 'connect', 'service', 'adjust', 'lack', 'demand', 'executive', 'match', 'step', 'take', 'reduce', 'salary', 'christie', 'base', 'salary', 'around', 'accord', 'sec', 'filing', 'say', 'reduce', 'spirit', 'executive', 'reduce', 'pay', 'downturn', 'capacity', 'cut', 'deepen', 'reduction', 'spirit', 'announce', 'separate', 'sec', 'filing', 'march', 'day', 'world', 'health', 'organization', 'officially', 'declare', 'coronavirus', 'pandemic', 'filing', 'week', 'project', 'cost', 'per', 'available', 'seat', 'mile', 'exclude', 'fuel', 'expect', 'rise', 'quarter', 'low', 'original', 'expectation', 'spirit', 'expect', 'decline', 'fuel', 'price', 'help', 'offset', 'financial', 'pressure', 'american', 'carrier', 'take', 'lack', 'demand', 'opportunity', 'ground', 'old', 'conversation', 'manufacturer', 'postpone', 'delivery', 'reduce', 'maintenance', 'storage', 'expense', 'march', 'however', 'spirit', 'expect', 'take', 'delivery']"
"Air Canada today says it will gradually suspend most international flights by 31 March in response to the coronavirus pandemic while maintaining a few routes to help Canadian citizens repatriate and continue essential cargo deliveries. US president Donald Trump and Canada's prime minister Justin Trudeau have announced plans to temporarily close their national borders to non-essential travel. As Canada's largest airline, the Montreal-based flag carrier aims to work within travel restrictions issued by governments through April to continue operating a small number of international routes including across the US border from select Canadian cities. ”Air Canada intends to continue to operate a limited number of international 'air bridges' between one or more of its Canadian hubs and the cities of London, Paris, Frankfurt, Delhi, Tokyo and Hong Kong from April 1 until at least April 30,” the carrier says in a statement. “This will reduce its international network from 101 airports to six.” Air Canada by 1 April plans to reduce its transborder network with the USA from 53 airports to 13, depending on further reductions based on demand or government edicts. The airline will operate “a significantly reduced network” after March but says it aims to continue serving all provinces and territories of Canada. Air Canada intends to reduce its domestic network from 62 airports to 40 through April. Safety is the priority, Air Canada chief executive Calin Rovinescu says in a statement, while adding that travel restrictions imposed by governments worldwide “are nonetheless having a cataclysmic effect upon the global airline industry”. “We are working around the clock to deal with the impact for our customers and our business of the various travel restrictions that are being made by governments at unprecedented speed without advance warning,” Rovinescu says. Like many of its peers, the flag carrier has withdrawn earnings guidance for 2020 and 2021, and suspended 50% of its capacity for the second quarter",3,463,12.0,0.2664,"travel, government, country, coronavirus, measure, restriction, passenger, state, march, canada","['canada', 'today', 'say', 'gradually', 'suspend', 'international', 'march', 'response', 'coronavirus', 'pandemic', 'maintain', 'route', 'help', 'canadian', 'citizen', 'repatriate', 'continue', 'essential', 'cargo', 'delivery', 'u', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'canada', 'prime', 'minister', 'justin', 'trudeau', 'announce', 'plan', 'temporarily', 'close', 'national', 'border', 'nonessential', 'travel', 'canada', 'large', 'montrealbased', 'flag', 'carrier', 'aim', 'work', 'within', 'travel', 'restriction', 'issue', 'government', 'april', 'continue', 'operating', 'small', 'number', 'international', 'route', 'include', 'across', 'u', 'border', 'select', 'canadian', 'city', 'canada', 'intend', 'continue', 'operate', 'limited', 'number', 'international', 'bridge', 'canadian', 'hub', 'city', 'london', 'paris', 'frankfurt', 'delhi', 'tokyo', 'hong', 'kong', 'april', 'least', 'april', 'carrier', 'say', 'statement', 'reduce', 'international', 'network', 'airport', 'canada', 'april', 'plan', 'reduce', 'transborder', 'network', 'usa', 'airport', 'depend', 'far', 'reduction', 'base', 'demand', 'government', 'edict', 'operate', 'significantly', 'reduce', 'network', 'march', 'say', 'aim', 'continue', 'serve', 'province', 'territory', 'canada', 'canada', 'intend', 'reduce', 'domestic', 'network', 'airport', 'april', 'safety', 'priority', 'canada', 'chief', 'executive', 'calin', 'rovinescu', 'say', 'statement', 'add', 'travel', 'restriction', 'impose', 'government', 'worldwide', 'nonetheless', 'cataclysmic', 'effect', 'upon', 'global', 'industry', 'work', 'around', 'clock', 'deal', 'impact', 'customer', 'business', 'various', 'travel', 'restriction', 'make', 'government', 'unprecedented', 'speed', 'without', 'advance', 'warn', 'rovinescu', 'say', 'like', 'many', 'peer', 'flag', 'carrier', 'withdrawn', 'earnings', 'guidance', 'suspend', 'capacity', 'second', 'quarter']"
"As part of a growing effort to support the US government's response to coronavirus, the US Air Force (USAF) moved 500,000 swabs aboard a C-17 Globemaster III from an airbase in Italy to the USA. USAF Air Mobility Command also recently activated a 24/7 Crisis Battle Staff and Operational Planning Team to assess and plan for coronavirus impacts to the command's regular mission as well as its ability to help with the logistical response to the pandemic, it says on 18 March. The USAF did not respond to a question about the source of the swabs. The news was first reported by Defense One. “On March 17, [Air Mobility Command] transported a shipment of 13 pallets of Covid-19 testing supplies aboard a C-17 Globemaster III from Aviano Air Base, Italy, to the Memphis Air National Guard Base where the 164th Airlift Wing C-17 is assigned,” says the USAF. “Air Mobility Command is postured to support additional requests to deliver Covid-19 testing supplies in the coming weeks.” Upon arrival in Memphis the swabs were loaded onto FedEx aircraft for distribution throughout the USA, the service adds. Swabs are needed to pull samples from the nose and back of the throat of potential coronavirus carriers. In recent days, as testing for the virus has increased, hospitals have reported shortages of swabs. The United States Transportation Command, a joint command of the US armed services, is coordinating with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to handle any other future requests for fast air cargo movements, says General David Goldfein, chief of staff of the USAF, at a Pentagon press conference on 18 March. “The vice chairman [of the Joint Chiefs of Staff] and the deputy secretary [of defense] are leading the Department of Defense effort,” he says. “They plug into the Vice President's Task Force and we have an element which with HHS that then helps to find the requirements, and then communicate those requirements over to the Department of Defense.” The USAF can move patients on litters on several aircraft, including the Lockheed Martin C-130 cargo transport, Boeing KC-135 in-flight refuelling taker, and Boeing C-17. The number of people who can be moved in an aircraft depends on the severity of the patient's illness. “It all depends on the situation and the criticality of the patient. If they are less critical, I can move more at one time. If they're more critical, I can move less,” says Lieutenant General Dorothy Hogg, surgeon general of the USAF. Aircraft fitted with isolation units can transport less than 10 patients at once, adds Goldfein. He declines to say the overall capacity of the USAF, citing national security concerns with ongoing military operations. However, the service's capacity is not immediately in danger of being over tasked. “Right now, we're not seeing any limitation in our capacity to meet those movement requirements, especially when we're talking about small test kits where we can put multiple numbers on a large airplane,” says Goldfein. Because USAF aeromedical evacuations are intended for war casualties, the service thinks it will likely not take coronavirus patients. Instead, it would focus on relieving hospitals' trauma care, such as treating gunshot wounds. The USAF is looking at all its options, says Goldfein. “Secretary [of defense Mark] Esper asked all of us, in both a fixed-wing and rotary-wing capacity, what is it that we could bring?” he says. “We have that analysis ongoing.”",3,464,1.0,0.4042,"test, force, helicopter, fire, system, service, attack, design, usaf, missile","['part', 'grow', 'effort', 'support', 'u', 'government', 'response', 'coronavirus', 'u', 'force', 'usaf', 'move', 'swab', 'aboard', 'globemaster', 'iii', 'airbase', 'italy', 'usa', 'usaf', 'mobility', 'command', 'recently', 'activate', 'crisis', 'battle', 'staff', 'operational', 'planning', 'team', 'ass', 'plan', 'coronavirus', 'impact', 'command', 'regular', 'mission', 'well', 'ability', 'help', 'logistical', 'response', 'pandemic', 'say', 'march', 'usaf', 'respond', 'question', 'source', 'swab', 'news', 'report', 'defense', 'march', 'mobility', 'command', 'transport', 'shipment', 'pallet', 'coronavirus', 'test', 'supply', 'aboard', 'globemaster', 'iii', 'aviano', 'base', 'italy', 'memphis', 'national', 'guard', 'base', 'airlift', 'wing', 'assign', 'say', 'usaf', 'mobility', 'command', 'posture', 'support', 'additional', 'request', 'deliver', 'coronavirus', 'test', 'supply', 'come', 'upon', 'arrival', 'memphis', 'swab', 'load', 'onto', 'fedex', 'distribution', 'throughout', 'usa', 'service', 'add', 'swab', 'need', 'pull', 'sample', 'nose', 'back', 'throat', 'potential', 'coronavirus', 'carrier', 'recent', 'day', 'test', 'virus', 'increase', 'hospital', 'report', 'shortage', 'swab', 'united', 'state', 'transportation', 'command', 'joint', 'command', 'u', 'arm', 'service', 'coordinate', 'department', 'health', 'human', 'service', 'hhs', 'handle', 'future', 'request', 'fast', 'cargo', 'movement', 'say', 'general', 'david', 'goldfein', 'chief', 'staff', 'usaf', 'pentagon', 'press', 'conference', 'march', 'vice', 'chairman', 'joint', 'chief', 'staff', 'deputy', 'secretary', 'defense', 'lead', 'department', 'defense', 'effort', 'say', 'plug', 'vice', 'president', 'task', 'force', 'element', 'hhs', 'help', 'find', 'requirement', 'communicate', 'requirement', 'department', 'usaf', 'move', 'patient', 'litter', 'several', 'include', 'lockheed', 'martin', 'cargo', 'transport', 'inflight', 'refuel', 'taker', 'number', 'people', 'move', 'depends', 'severity', 'patient', 'illness', 'depends', 'situation', 'criticality', 'patient', 'less', 'critical', 'move', 'critical', 'move', 'less', 'say', 'lieutenant', 'general', 'dorothy', 'hogg', 'surgeon', 'general', 'usaf', 'fit', 'isolation', 'unit', 'transport', 'less', 'patient', 'add', 'goldfein', 'decline', 'say', 'overall', 'capacity', 'usaf', 'cite', 'national', 'security', 'concern', 'ongoing', 'military', 'operation', 'however', 'service', 'capacity', 'immediately', 'danger', 'tasked', 'right', 'see', 'limitation', 'capacity', 'meet', 'movement', 'requirement', 'especially', 'talk', 'small', 'test', 'kit', 'put', 'multiple', 'number', 'large', 'airplane', 'say', 'goldfein', 'usaf', 'aeromedical', 'evacuation', 'intend', 'war', 'casualty', 'service', 'think', 'likely', 'take', 'coronavirus', 'patient', 'instead', 'focus', 'relieve', 'hospital', 'trauma', 'care', 'treat', 'gunshot', 'wound', 'usaf', 'look', 'option', 'say', 'goldfein', 'secretary', 'defense', 'mark', 'esper', 'ask', 'u', 'fixedwing', 'rotarywing', 'capacity', 'bring', 'say', 'analysis', 'ongoing']"
"Canadian regional carrier Porter Airlines says it is shutting down all operations until June, according to a notice on the airline's website. The Toronto-based regional carrier says on 18 March that the global coronavirus crisis is prompting the closure, which will begin at the end of operations on 20 March. Porter Airlines shuts temporarily “COVID-19 is having an unprecedented effect on people around the world and Porter is determined to do our part to support the efforts of the Canadian, US and global authorities in their responses,” says Michael Deluce, Porter's president and chief executive, in a note on the airline's website. “Restricting activities by people in all communities is what's required to keep our team members and passengers healthy, and ultimately to end this fast-spreading pandemic. A temporary suspension of all flights allows the public health crisis to diminish and then time to restart our operations,” he says. Porter is Canada's third largest airline after Air Canada and WestJet, servicing 19 destinations in eastern and central Canada as well as the northeastern United States on a fleet of 29 De Havilland Aircraft of Canada Dash 8-400 aircraft. The airline has orders for 12 Airbus A220. Deluce also says the airline will issue temporary layoffs and that executive team members will have their salaries cut up to 30% until flights resume. He and his father Robert Deluce, the airline's executive chairman, will not receive any salary during this time.

It expects that after 24 March “most if not all Ryanair Group flights will be grounded”, with the possible exception of a few key routes, mostly between the UK and Ireland. “Over the past few days, the spread of the Covid-19 virus has led most EU governments to impose severe travel bans and restrictions, which have had a negative impact on the schedules of all Ryanair airlines, causing widespread cancellations and travel disruptions across the network,” the group notes.

"Copenhagen airport's operator is allocating two of its three runways to aircraft parking while the coronavirus crisis persists, as airlines seek to ground large proportions of their fleet. The operator says it expects a “high double-digit” number of aircraft to be parked at the Danish capital hub “before long”, and that the parking issue is a “pressing challenge”. It will maintain flight access by keeping a single runway, 22L/04R, in operation for departures and arrivals. Scandinavian carrier SAS is among the primary users of the airport, but the airline – like many others – is effectively shutting down in response to the coronavirus situation. Over the first 10 days of March the impact of the outbreak resulted in Copenhagen passenger numbers falling by nearly a third, the airport operator states, and the drop has increased to 70%. “This is something we've never seen before,” says chief executive Thomas Woldbye “The situation is developing much faster and more dramatically than what happened during the financial crisis, after 9/11, the ash cloud and any other event that has impacted on aviation since the Second World War.” The airport company's share price, which had been largely flat for more than two years, started wavering at the end of January and has since fallen by close to 30%. Investments are being put on hold and the company expects to save DKr400-700 million over the remainder of this year in capital expenditure, plus a further DKr250-350 million in operating costs. The company is also looking to further savings from a government wage compensation scheme. It expects to put more than 1,500 of its 2,600 personnel on temporary leave. Some of the airport's 91 shops and 46 restaurants have agreed to remain open, mainly in Pier C, to where arriving passengers are being directed under border-control measures. Development projects to be postponed include parts of the airside expansion of Terminal 3, as well as a number of other upgrades to infrastructure – among them climate schemes such as solar panel installation. “All safety-related investments will be exempt from the cost-cutting programme,” the operator stresses. Uncertainty over the extent and duration of the crisis means the airport operator cannot provide a realistic forecast of the financial impact on its business. “We have an important responsibility to keep the airport running and making sure that critical flight operations, such as freight, can continue,” says Woldbye. “Our main priority is to make sure that the initiatives we're launching now will not have a long-term negative impact on our ability to return quickly to normal operations when we have to.”",3,471,4.0,0.2122,"airport, fleet, service, data, carrier, operation, passenger, number, operate, operator","['copenhagen', 'airport', 'operator', 'allocate', 'runway', 'parking', 'coronavirus', 'crisis', 'persists', 'seek', 'ground', 'large', 'proportion', 'fleet', 'operator', 'say', 'expect', 'high', 'doubledigit', 'number', 'park', 'danish', 'capital', 'hub', 'long', 'parking', 'issue', 'press', 'challenge', 'maintain', 'access', 'keep', 'single', 'runway', 'operation', 'departure', 'arrival', 'scandinavian', 'carrier', 'sa', 'among', 'primary', 'user', 'airport', 'like', 'many', 'others', 'effectively', 'shut', 'response', 'coronavirus', 'situation', 'day', 'march', 'impact', 'outbreak', 'result', 'copenhagen', 'passenger', 'number', 'fall', 'nearly', 'third', 'airport', 'operator', 'state', 'drop', 'increase', 'something', 'never', 'see', 'say', 'chief', 'executive', 'thomas', 'woldbye', 'situation', 'develop', 'much', 'faster', 'dramatically', 'happen', 'financial', 'crisis', 'ash', 'cloud', 'event', 'impact', 'since', 'second', 'world', 'airport', 'share', 'price', 'largely', 'flat', 'start', 'waver', 'end', 'january', 'since', 'fall', 'close', 'investment', 'put', 'hold', 'expect', 'save', 'remainder', 'capital', 'expenditure', 'plus', 'far', 'operating', 'cost', 'look', 'far', 'saving', 'government', 'wage', 'compensation', 'scheme', 'expect', 'put', 'personnel', 'temporary', 'leave', 'airport', 'shop', 'restaurant', 'agree', 'remain', 'open', 'mainly', 'pier', 'c', 'arrive', 'passenger', 'direct', 'bordercontrol', 'measure', 'development', 'project', 'postpone', 'include', 'part', 'airside', 'expansion', 'terminal', 'well', 'number', 'upgrade', 'infrastructure', 'among', 'climate', 'scheme', 'solar', 'panel', 'installation', 'safetyrelated', 'investment', 'exempt', 'costcutting', 'programme', 'operator', 'stress', 'uncertainty', 'extent', 'duration', 'crisis', 'mean', 'airport', 'operator', 'provide', 'realistic', 'forecast', 'financial', 'impact', 'business', 'important', 'responsibility', 'keep', 'airport', 'run', 'make', 'sure', 'critical', 'operation', 'freight', 'continue', 'say', 'woldbye', 'main', 'priority', 'make', 'sure', 'initiative', 'launch', 'longterm', 'negative', 'impact', 'ability', 'return', 'quickly', 'normal', 'operation']"

"The Taiwanese government will offer financial aid to its carriers – in the form of subsidies and loans – to help cushion the financial blow from the coronavirus. Among the measures the MInistry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) rolled out was the offering of loans to help airlines with normal operations. The ministry did not indicate the quantum of loan available to the carriers. Taiwanese carriers can also apply for subsidies from the government for expenses incurred while implementing prevention measures against the coronavirus outbreak. These can be backdated to 15 January, the ministry adds. Media reports, citing MOTC deputy minister Huang Yu-Lin, state that the entire plan is expected to cost the government about NT$30 billion ($994 million). Taiwan will also offer to waive or lower landing and parking fees for its carriers, Huang adds. The move comes as Taiwan's six major carriers – including China Airlines and EVA Air – have lobbied the government for assistance to tide through this period. Taiwan's Civil Aviation Administration also notes that international passenger traffic into Taiwan had been halved for February, following softening travel demand and travel restrictions imposed.

"Virgin Australia will suspend all international flights until June, and ground its entire widebody fleet, as it continues to reel from the impact of coronavirus outbreak. It will also cut domestic capacity by half until June, up from a previously announced cut of 5%. Virgin Australia states that it was cutting all international flights from 30 March owing to new travel restrictions announced by the Australian government, as well as measures imposed by countries across the world. “Virgin Australia will operate a reduced international schedule between now and 29 March, to enable Australians to return home and visitors to return to their point of origin,” it says. On the domestic front, the carrier says capacity cuts are due to weakened travel demand. It adds that it will be working through route and schedule details now, and will inform its customers in the coming week. In total, the Virgin Australia Group – which also includes Tigerair Australia – will ground 53 aircraft across its international and domestic units. These include all five of its Boeing 777-300ERs and six Airbus A330-200s, as well as 34 737s and six A320s. Virgin Australia's move to cut capacity comes a day after compatriot Qantas announced similar cuts to its network, including grounding nearly its entire fleet of widebodies. The Oneworld carrier will be cutting international capacity by 90% and domestic by 60%, until end-May. Virgin's cuts also follow its suspension of earnings guidance for the current financial year “due to ongoing uncertainty of the Covid-19 situation.” In response to the growing fallout over the coronavirus outbreak, Australia announced a A$715 million ($430 million) relief package for its aviation industry, which include waivers on fees and charges.",3,475,5.0,0.3343,"carrier, march, international, outbreak, suspend, capacity, schedule, april, united, coronavirus","['virgin', 'australia', 'suspend', 'international', 'june', 'ground', 'entire', 'widebody', 'fleet', 'continue', 'reel', 'impact', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'cut', 'domestic', 'capacity', 'half', 'june', 'previously', 'announce', 'cut', 'virgin', 'australia', 'state', 'cut', 'international', 'march', 'owe', 'travel', 'restriction', 'announce', 'australian', 'government', 'well', 'measure', 'impose', 'country', 'across', 'world', 'virgin', 'australia', 'operate', 'reduce', 'international', 'schedule', 'march', 'enable', 'australian', 'return', 'home', 'visitor', 'return', 'point', 'origin', 'say', 'domestic', 'front', 'carrier', 'say', 'capacity', 'cut', 'due', 'weaken', 'travel', 'demand', 'add', 'work', 'route', 'schedule', 'detail', 'inform', 'customer', 'come', 'week', 'total', 'virgin', 'australia', 'include', 'tigerair', 'australia', 'ground', 'across', 'international', 'domestic', 'unit', 'include', 'well', 'virgin', 'australia', 'move', 'cut', 'capacity', 'come', 'day', 'compatriot', 'qantas', 'announce', 'similar', 'cut', 'network', 'include', 'ground', 'nearly', 'entire', 'fleet', 'widebodies', 'oneworld', 'carrier', 'cut', 'international', 'capacity', 'domestic', 'endmay', 'virgin', 'cut', 'follow', 'suspension', 'earnings', 'guidance', 'current', 'financial', 'due', 'ongoing', 'uncertainty', 'coronavirus', 'response', 'grow', 'fallout', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'australia', 'announce', 'relief', 'package', 'industry', 'include', 'waiver', 'fee', 'charge']"
"Hawaiian Airlines will suspend its three weekly nonstop flights between Honolulu International airport (HNL) and New Chitose Airport (CTS) in Sapporo from 2 April through 18 July due to coronavirus risks, cutting into its revenue hopes for its Japan network. The carrier, which has served Sapporo since 2012, aims to resume service 21 July. Hawaiian on 17 March says in a statement that it will assist guests impacted by the network change with refunds or accommodations on alternative flights. “We remain committed to supporting guests traveling between Japan and Hawai'i,” Hawaiian Airlines senior vice-president for global sales Theo Panagiotoulias says in a statement. “Sapporo is a critical city in our Japan network and we look forward to resuming service in the summer.” This route suspension comes as Hawaiian plans to suspend thrice-weekly service between Kona and Haneda on 28 March, along with four-times-weekly service between Honolulu and Haneda through April. This change is part of the carrier's overall plan to trim capacity by 8-10% in April and 15-20% in May to match the lack of flight demand compared with its original 2020 capacity goal. “We know this will not be our new normal, but we can't know when health experts and community mitigation efforts will bring the spread of the virus under control – or when travel apprehension will fade,” Hawaiian Airlines chief executive Peter Ingram said in a 13 March statement. Ingram added that the carrier will freeze hiring, review third-party contracts and defer non-essential aircraft painting to save costs amid the coronavirus outbreak. Hawaiian vice-president of network planning Brent Overbeek told Cirium in January that expanding its network to new locations in Japan and increasing connections within that nation was a key part of the airline's 2020 growth strategy.

"Singapore Airlines will operate at 50% capacity until end-April and is looking to shore up liquidity. “Given the growing scale of the border controls globally and its deepening impact on air travel, SIA expects to make further cuts to its capacity,” the carrier says in a statement.

"Vietnam will cease issuing visas for incoming visitors over the next 30 days as the country seeks to prevent the spread of coronavirus. According to a government web site, exceptions include overseas Vietnamese and their spouses and children, but only if they can submit papers that prove they have not tested positive for the virus. “Foreigners who are experts, business managers, and highly skilled workers” must also submit papers proving they are not positive for the virus, which originated in China and has since become a global pandemic. Vietnam has aggressively imposed 14 day quarantines on many arriving passengers. Footage of angry travellers arguing with officials at airports have appeared on social media. “In addition to the current quarantine measures, the government has decided that all incoming travellers from the US, Europe and ASEAN countries shall be subject to centralised quarantine,” adds the government. “Competent authorities shall supervise and medically monitor those who are not subject to centralized quarantine during their mandatory isolation at place of residence.” Passengers flying into and out of Vietnam are required to wear masks at all times aboard the aircraft. Separately, Vietnam Airlines said it will temporary suspend flights between Malaysia and France from 17 March. Malaysia is under full lockdown, with no new arrivals allowed and no Malaysian citizens allowed to leave. The Malaysian suspension will run from 18 to 31 March, when the country's lockdown is lifted. The airline gave no timeframe for when France services will resume. “Upon receiving updated rulings from the authorities, Vietnam Airlines will announce its operational resumption of flights to France and Malaysia, accordingly,” says the carrier. “For other destinations, the airline will continue to monitor the situation and implement appropriate adjustments in response to any new resolutions passed by these governments.

"Trans States Airlines, which announced last month that it would be shuttering at the end of the year due to consolidation and a pilot shortage, has told its employees that it will go out of business nine months earlier, on 1 April. It could be the first US airline to fall victim to the coronavirus that has decimated the industry. “It's difficult to articulate or even comprehend the speed at which the coronavirus has changed our industry and our world,” president of Trans States Holdings Rick Leach writes in a memo to employees on 17 March. “We received word late last night that the immediate cuts to our schedule are far deeper than we feared. “We knew that the wind-down would be accelerated, but were confident that we could continue to fly for United for some months. Yet now, less than one month after our original announcement, we now have less than two weeks of flying remaining. It hardly seems possible,” he adds. Trans States did not respond to requests for comment on the internal memo. In late February, Trans States Airlines, which operates 46 Embraer ERJ-145 jets for United Airlines from Denver, Chicago and St. Louis, said it would be winding down operations at the end of 2020. According to Cirium fleets data, the airline provides feeder services to more than 80 cities in North America with about 240 daily flights. The Trans States memo to employees in February said United expressed a desire to “simplify the Embraer 145 programme by consolidating flying”. In addition, the company cited a pilot shortage as another reason it will cease operations. On Monday, industry group Airlines for America (A4A) asked the government for $58 billion in aid to assist airlines as they manage through the coronavirus crisis that has led to sharp declines in demand and subsequent cuts in service.

"Lockheed Martin has made several improvements to the F-35's Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS), but the technology remains plagued by about 4,700 deficiencies. A new Government Accountability Office (GAO) review of ALIS, the F-35's ground-based software support system, outlines the scope of problems still affecting the technology, which has long been plagued by issues. The report says 66% of outstanding deficiencies came to light in the last two years, and 22% are “Category 1” or “Category 2” problems. “Category 1 deficiencies are considered critical and could jeopardise safety, security or another requirement,” says the GAO's report. “Category 2 deficiencies are those that could impede or constrain successful mission accomplishment.” The report does break out numbers of Category 1 versus Category 2 deficiencies. ALIS, made by Lockheed Martin, is a ground-based computer that supports F-35 operations. Its software manages prognostics, maintenance, supply chain, flight operations and training. For instance, ALIS' prognostic system tracks time before parts must be replaced; the maintenance system schedules and tracks aircraft maintenance; the supply chain system manages parts inventory; the operations system plans and debriefs missions; and the training system tracks pilot and maintainer training records. ALIS' 4,700 open deficiencies are atop 873 deficiencies with the F-35, problems which were recently outlined in the US Department of Defense's (DoD's) Office of the Director of Operational Test & Evaluation. The report was released to the US Congress on 30 January. In the same way that a large number of ALIS deficiencies were found recently, personnel responsible for fixing the F-35 aircraft are also regularly discovering new problems. “Although the programme is working to fix deficiencies, new discoveries are still being made, resulting in only a minor decrease in the overall number of deficiencies,” says that report. Despite a myriad of problems, some small improvements are being made to ALIS, according to a GAO survey of five sites which host the system. “According to pilots, maintainers, supply personnel and contractors at five US F-35 locations, ALIS is generally performing better than it was 5 years ago,” says GAO. “Specifically, users at all five locations stated that data processing, downloading of information and screen navigation were generally faster than previous years.” That progress continues to be outweighed by a large amount of problems with ALIS. “While users at all five F-35 locations we visited said that ALIS is performing better than it was 5 years ago, they also stated that the system still posed significant challenges to day-to-day F-35 operations,” says GAO. The government agency's survey of facilities found seven major groups of problems remain: inaccurate or missing data, challenges deploying the system, a need for more personnel than anticipated, an inefficient issue resolution process, poor user experience, immature applications and ineffective training. In the long run, Lockheed Martin and the F-35 Joint Program Office (JPO) plan to scrap ALIS and replace it with the Operational Data Integrated Network (ODIN), a cloud-based system which they claim will not have the same problems and will be ready by December 2022. For its part, Lockheed Martin emphasises recent improvements and declines to comment on when ALIS issues will be fixed. “Lockheed Martin is working closely with the F-35 JPO on ALIS enhancements and we remain committed to improving speed, reducing labor and enhancing the user experience as we transition to the government-led Operational Data and Integrated Network,” says the company. Ultimately, the GAO is concerned the Pentagon and Lockheed Martin do not have a sufficient plan for fixing ALIS in the short term. “The Department of Defense has not developed a performance measurement process for ALIS, which GAO recommended in 2014, or determined how ALIS issues affect F-35 fleet readiness,” says the agency. “Without efforts in these areas, DoD will be hindered in addressing ALIS challenges and improving aircraft readiness.”",3,480,1.0,0.4396,"test, force, helicopter, fire, system, service, attack, design, usaf, missile","['lockheed', 'martin', 'make', 'several', 'improvement', 'autonomic', 'logistics', 'information', 'system', 'ali', 'technology', 'remains', 'plague', 'deficiency', 'government', 'accountability', 'office', 'gao', 'review', 'ali', 'groundbased', 'software', 'support', 'system', 'outline', 'scope', 'problem', 'still', 'affect', 'technology', 'long', 'plague', 'issue', 'report', 'say', 'outstanding', 'deficiency', 'come', 'light', 'category', 'category', 'problem', 'category', 'deficiency', 'consider', 'critical', 'jeopardise', 'safety', 'security', 'another', 'requirement', 'say', 'gao', 'report', 'category', 'deficiency', 'impede', 'constrain', 'successful', 'mission', 'report', 'break', 'number', 'category', 'versus', 'category', 'deficiency', 'ali', 'make', 'lockheed', 'martin', 'groundbased', 'computer', 'support', 'operation', 'software', 'manages', 'prognostic', 'maintenance', 'supply', 'chain', 'operation', 'training', 'instance', 'ali', 'prognostic', 'system', 'track', 'part', 'must', 'replace', 'maintenance', 'system', 'schedule', 'track', 'maintenance', 'supply', 'chain', 'system', 'manages', 'part', 'inventory', 'operation', 'system', 'plan', 'debriefs', 'mission', 'training', 'system', 'track', 'pilot', 'maintainer', 'training', 'record', 'ali', 'open', 'deficiency', 'atop', 'deficiency', 'problem', 'recently', 'outline', 'u', 'department', 'defense', 'dod', 'office', 'director', 'operational', 'test', 'evaluation', 'report', 'release', 'u', 'congress', 'january', 'way', 'large', 'number', 'ali', 'deficiency', 'found', 'recently', 'personnel', 'responsible', 'fix', 'regularly', 'discover', 'problem', 'although', 'programme', 'work', 'fix', 'deficiency', 'discovery', 'still', 'make', 'result', 'minor', 'decrease', 'overall', 'number', 'deficiency', 'say', 'report', 'despite', 'myriad', 'problem', 'small', 'improvement', 'make', 'ali', 'accord', 'gao', 'survey', 'site', 'host', 'system', 'accord', 'pilot', 'maintainer', 'supply', 'personnel', 'contractor', 'u', 'location', 'ali', 'generally', 'perform', 'well', 'ago', 'say', 'gao', 'specifically', 'user', 'location', 'state', 'data', 'processing', 'download', 'information', 'screen', 'navigation', 'generally', 'faster', 'previous', 'progress', 'continue', 'outweigh', 'large', 'amount', 'problem', 'ali', 'user', 'location', 'visit', 'say', 'ali', 'perform', 'well', 'ago', 'state', 'system', 'still', 'pose', 'significant', 'challenge', 'daytoday', 'operation', 'say', 'gao', 'government', 'agency', 'survey', 'facility', 'found', 'major', 'problem', 'remain', 'inaccurate', 'miss', 'data', 'challenge', 'deploy', 'system', 'need', 'personnel', 'anticipate', 'inefficient', 'issue', 'resolution', 'process', 'poor', 'user', 'experience', 'immature', 'application', 'ineffective', 'training', 'long', 'run', 'lockheed', 'martin', 'joint', 'program', 'office', 'jpo', 'plan', 'scrap', 'ali', 'replace', 'operational', 'data', 'integrate', 'network', 'odin', 'cloudbased', 'system', 'claim', 'problem', 'ready', 'december', 'part', 'lockheed', 'martin', 'emphasis', 'recent', 'improvement', 'decline', 'comment', 'ali', 'issue', 'fix', 'lockheed', 'martin', 'work', 'closely', 'jpo', 'ali', 'enhancement', 'remain', 'commit', 'improve', 'speed', 'reduce', 'labor', 'enhance', 'user', 'experience', 'transition', 'governmentled', 'operational', 'data', 'integrate', 'network', 'say', 'ultimately', 'gao', 'concerned', 'pentagon', 'lockheed', 'martin', 'sufficient', 'plan', 'fix', 'ali', 'short', 'term', 'department', 'defense', 'developed', 'performance', 'measurement', 'process', 'ali', 'gao', 'recommend', 'determine', 'ali', 'issue', 'affect', 'fleet', 'readiness', 'say', 'agency', 'without', 'effort', 'area', 'dod', 'hinder', 'address', 'ali', 'challenge', 'improve', 'readiness']"
"Brussels Airlines has become the latest carrier to shut down services in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, suspending all scheduled flights for a month. It says the services will be gradually wound down and then halted on 21 March and will not restart until 20 April. “We need to take the decision to temporarily cease our operations,” says chief executive Dieter Vranckx. “It will allow us to reduce the negative financial impact on our company.” Brussels Airlines says it “fully understands” the travel measures imposed by the Belgian authorities and other governments. It adds that it will retain a “minimal” standby capacity ready to serve any demand for repatriation flights.

"Italy's government has indicated that it will renationalise struggling flag-carrier Alitalia as part of a broad set of emergency measures in response to the coronavirus outbreak. The government says, in a decree published on 16 March, that the epidemic is being formally recognised as a “natural disaster and exceptional event”. It states that, given the damage to the entire aviation sector resulting from this event, public-service measures will compensate and allow the continuation of activities. “The establishment of a new company is authorised, entirely controlled by the ministry of economy and finance,” it adds, in reference to the situation facing Alitalia and its regional CityLiner division, both of which are in extraordinary administration. This new company could alternatively be controlled by an organisation with “predominantly public participation”, the decree says.

"London Southend airport operator Stobart Group has disclosed that it has been negotiating sale of a minority share in the airport, but that discussions have been suspended as a result of the coronavirus uncertainty. The discussions had signalled a value for the airport of £700-800 million, says the company, referring to suggestions that a 25% stake was on offer. “No acceptable terms have been agreed and discussions have since been put on hold while both parties navigate the [coronavirus] outbreak,” it adds. Stobart Group says the airport will be affected by significant route cancellations and adds that the company is likely to need additional liquidity. “The group is actively reviewing the most appropriate sources of funds to cover the period during which the airport is affected by [the outbreak],” it says, adding that it has taken measures to conserve cash and reduce its cost base. Stobart cannot estimate passenger numbers for the 2020-21 fiscal year. It says the figures for the year ending 29 February 2020 reached 2.1 million, up 43%. The company is also discussing management of guarantees and potential lease obligations following the collapse of UK regional operator Flybe. Stobart Group is a shareholder in Flybe parent Connect Airways. “It is impossible to say what structural changes will occur to the aviation industry in the coming months,” says chief executive Warwick Brady. “Ultimately the current crisis will pass, and people will continue to want to fly in and out of one of the world's largest travel markets.”",3,484,8.0,0.1943,"government, uk, carrier, business, state, share, south, airway, financial, plan","['london', 'southend', 'airport', 'operator', 'stobart', 'disclose', 'negotiate', 'sale', 'minority', 'share', 'airport', 'discussion', 'suspend', 'result', 'coronavirus', 'uncertainty', 'discussion', 'signal', 'value', 'airport', 'say', 'refer', 'suggestion', 'stake', 'offer', 'acceptable', 'term', 'agree', 'discussion', 'since', 'put', 'hold', 'party', 'navigate', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'add', 'stobart', 'say', 'airport', 'affected', 'significant', 'route', 'cancellation', 'add', 'likely', 'need', 'additional', 'liquidity', 'actively', 'review', 'appropriate', 'source', 'fund', 'cover', 'period', 'airport', 'affected', 'outbreak', 'say', 'add', 'take', 'measure', 'conserve', 'cash', 'reduce', 'cost', 'base', 'stobart', 'estimate', 'passenger', 'number', 'fiscal', 'say', 'figure', 'end', 'february', 'reach', 'discuss', 'management', 'guarantee', 'potential', 'lease', 'obligation', 'follow', 'collapse', 'uk', 'regional', 'operator', 'flybe', 'stobart', 'shareholder', 'flybe', 'parent', 'connect', 'airway', 'impossible', 'say', 'structural', 'change', 'occur', 'industry', 'come', 'month', 'say', 'chief', 'executive', 'warwick', 'brady', 'ultimately', 'current', 'crisis', 'pas', 'people', 'continue', 'want', 'fly', 'world', 'large', 'travel', 'market']"
"Airbus is to halt production across its French and Spanish facilities for four days to give the company time to implement strict hygiene measures in response to the coronavirus outbreak. The airframer says the decision follows introduction of new procedures in both countries intended to contain the illness. Airbus says it will “temporarily pause” production and assembly at sites in France and Spain for the next four days, and work with social partners to bring in the changes. “This will allow sufficient time to implement stringent health and safety conditions in terms of hygiene, cleaning and self-distancing, while improving the efficiency of operations under the new working conditions,” it adds. Airbus says it is working with customers and suppliers to “minimise the impact” of this decision on their operations. Its French sites include the main Toulouse assembly line which produces the A350 among other types. The airframer is aiming to maximise home-working where feasible.

"Travel restrictions are closing in on Southeast Asia, as Malaysia imposes a partial lockdown after seeing a recent spike in coronavirus cases. From 18 to 31 March, citizens are restricted from leaving the country, while foreign visitors and tourists will be denied entry. Nearly all business, government offices and schools will be shut, except for those involved in essential services such as transport. Cirium schedules data shows that domestic routes within Malaysia, where the country's airlines have nearly 55% of the total seat capacity offered this month, will be significantly affected. Internationally, services to neighbours Indonesia, Singapore, and Thailand will be similarly affected, as they contribute 21% of capacity out of Malaysia. The decision will hit the five Malaysian carriers heavily, with AirAsia dominating 40% of the total seat capacity deployed this month, followed by Malaysia Airlines, Malindo Air, AirAsia X and Firefly. Given that AirAsia focuses on regional short-haul routes, the restrictions on movement and ban on foreigners will hit the low-cost operator hard. Meanwhile, neighbouring Singapore tightened up its border restrictions on 16 March, ordering travellers from Southeast Asian countries, Japan, Switzerland or the UK to stay at their place of residence for a 14-day period upon entering the country. Additionally, visitors from Southeast Asia will have to submit a health declaration for approval before entering Singapore. Singapore's ministry of health explains that it has seen more than a quarter of imported cases coming from its neighbours “for the purpose of seeking medical care”. This, it says, imposes “a significant burden on Singapore's healthcare resources during this critical period” when it is focused on containing the spread. These come on top of existing restrictions imposed on nationals of Iran, Italy, France, Germany, South Korea and Spain, as well as Chinese nationals from both inside and outside of Hubei province, who are not allowed to enter or transit through Singapore. Singapore's restrictions on its neighbours will have an impact on Changi Airport, as more than 45% of its seat capacity for this month is to Southeast Asian nations. Indonesia will be the most affected country, followed by Malaysia, Thailand, and the Philippines. Unlike Malaysia, Indonesia has ruled out a lockdown for now, choosing instead to urge its people to stay at home or reduce their public activities.

"The Cathay Pacific Group saw its February traffic results take a significant hit from the coronavirus outbreak, as it posted an unaudited loss of more than HK$2 billion ($257 million) for the month. The group, which earlier warned of a loss in the first half of the year, will operate a “bare skeleton” passenger flight schedule for April, as it cuts 90% of capacity across its network, as it anticipates further slumps in travel demand. In February, Cathay Pacific and Cathay Dragon carried 1,008,644 passengers, a 64.4% drop year-on-year. This was also lower than the just over 3 million passengers it carried in January. RPKs for the month fell 54% compared to the same period a year earlier, led by a dramatic 87.3% decrease in RPKs for Mainland China. Meanwhile, capacity as measured in ASKs fell 29.3%. By market, Mainland China, which in February bore the brunt of the coronavirus-related travel restrictions and itself imposed lockdowns in some cities, saw ASKs fall 76.1%. North east and South east Asia both registered drops in ASKs of above 35%. Consequently, passenger load factor for the month fell 28.6 points to 53.1%. Yield was also “significantly impacted”, notes group chief customer and commercial officer Ronald Lam. “On a typical day following the Chinese New Year peak we would normally carry around 90,000 passengers; towards the end of February, that figure dropped to below 20,000,” says Lam. Lam reiterates that the “scale of the challenge we are currently facing is unprecedented”. “Our advance passenger bookings show no clear signs of recovery at this stage, and the gap in bookings compared to 2019 continues to widen,” he states. On the group's deep capacity cuts, Lam adds: ““If we do not see a relaxation of travel restrictions in the near future, we expect the same arrangement will have to continue into May.” In its full-year results release on 11 March, Cathay warned that it was expecting a “substantial loss” for the first half of the year, as the double-whammy of political unrest – in the latter half of 2019 – and the coronavirus outbreak continues to depress travel demand in and out of the territory. Singapore Airlines, which also released its February traffic figures the same day, also took some heat from falling travel demand. For the month, the SIA Group's carriers – including SilkAir and Scoot – carried 2.18 million passengers, 21.8% lower year-on-year. RPKs for the period fell 17%, with regional unit SilkAir suffering the worst slump – it saw RPKs drop nearly 38% year-on-year. ASKs across the group dipped 2.4%, leading to a 12.1 percentage point decrease in passenger load factor for the month, to 69.1%. Passenger load factor across all sectors saw drops, with East Asia – which includes Mainland China and Hong Kong – seeing the worst performance. SIA and SilkAir both registered significant load factor decreases for the region, at 26% and 21% respectively. Like Cathay, SIA says March will continue to be a difficult month. “Market conditions have continued to deteriorate in March and, with [World Health Organisation] declaring COVID-19 a pandemic and multiple countries issuing travel advisories and restrictions, travel demand is expected to weaken significantly in the near term,” it states.",3,488,3.0,0.5008,"passenger, loss, operating, revenue, traffic, month, increase, capacity, decline, result","['cathay', 'pacific', 'saw', 'february', 'traffic', 'result', 'take', 'significant', 'hit', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'post', 'unaudited', 'loss', 'hk', 'month', 'earlier', 'warn', 'loss', 'half', 'operate', 'bare', 'skeleton', 'passenger', 'schedule', 'april', 'cut', 'capacity', 'across', 'network', 'anticipates', 'far', 'slump', 'travel', 'demand', 'february', 'cathay', 'pacific', 'cathay', 'dragon', 'carry', 'passenger', 'drop', 'yearonyear', 'low', 'passenger', 'carry', 'january', 'rpks', 'month', 'fell', 'compare', 'period', 'earlier', 'lead', 'dramatic', 'decrease', 'rpks', 'mainland', 'meanwhile', 'capacity', 'measure', 'asks', 'fell', 'market', 'mainland', 'february', 'bore', 'brunt', 'coronavirusrelated', 'travel', 'restriction', 'impose', 'lockdown', 'city', 'saw', 'asks', 'fall', 'north', 'east', 'south', 'east', 'asia', 'register', 'drop', 'asks', 'consequently', 'passenger', 'load', 'factor', 'month', 'fell', 'point', 'yield', 'significantly', 'impact', 'note', 'chief', 'customer', 'commercial', 'officer', 'ronald', 'lam', 'typical', 'day', 'follow', 'chinese', 'peak', 'normally', 'carry', 'around', 'passenger', 'towards', 'end', 'february', 'figure', 'drop', 'say', 'lam', 'lam', 'reiterates', 'scale', 'challenge', 'currently', 'face', 'unprecedented', 'advance', 'passenger', 'booking', 'clear', 'sign', 'recovery', 'stage', 'gap', 'booking', 'compare', 'continue', 'widen', 'state', 'deep', 'capacity', 'cut', 'lam', 'add', 'see', 'relaxation', 'travel', 'restriction', 'near', 'future', 'expect', 'arrangement', 'continue', 'fullyear', 'result', 'release', 'march', 'cathay', 'warn', 'expect', 'substantial', 'loss', 'half', 'doublewhammy', 'political', 'unrest', 'latter', 'half', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'continue', 'depress', 'travel', 'demand', 'territory', 'singapore', 'release', 'february', 'traffic', 'figure', 'day', 'take', 'heat', 'fall', 'travel', 'demand', 'month', 'sia', 'carrier', 'include', 'silkair', 'scoot', 'carry', 'passenger', 'low', 'yearonyear', 'rpks', 'period', 'fell', 'regional', 'unit', 'silkair', 'suffer', 'bad', 'slump', 'saw', 'rpks', 'drop', 'nearly', 'yearonyear', 'asks', 'across', 'dipped', 'lead', 'percentage', 'point', 'decrease', 'passenger', 'load', 'factor', 'month', 'passenger', 'load', 'factor', 'across', 'sector', 'saw', 'drop', 'east', 'asia', 'include', 'mainland', 'hong', 'kong', 'see', 'bad', 'performance', 'sia', 'silkair', 'register', 'significant', 'load', 'factor', 'decrease', 'region', 'respectively', 'like', 'cathay', 'sia', 'say', 'march', 'continue', 'difficult', 'month', 'market', 'condition', 'continued', 'deteriorate', 'march', 'world', 'health', 'organisation', 'declare', 'coronavirus', 'pandemic', 'multiple', 'country', 'issue', 'travel', 'advisory', 'restriction', 'travel', 'demand', 'expect', 'weaken', 'significantly', 'near', 'term', 'state']"
"Aero Vodochody's L-39NG has passed fuselage strength tests, as the company works towards certification of the advanced jet trainer. Using the fuselage of aircraft 7002, which is earmarked for static trials, the test saw the structure initially taken to the limit load, which corresponds to the maximum possible load during flight. Subsequently, this was increased to the ultimate load, or 150% of limit load. It was only at 110% of this higher level that a structural failure occurred. “The purpose of the tests was to verify the strength of the airframe according to the requirements of [European military airworthiness certification criteria],” says Aero Vodochody. “During previous tests, the fuselage was loaded by bending, by inertial forces of the engine and also by forces from the horizontal tail. The last realised test represented the most critical case, it is the combined bending load of the horizontal and vertical tail.” Evaluations were discontinued after the structural failure appeared so as not to destroy the fuselage, which is needed for additional trials, such as the pilot hinge seat test. Four aircraft are earmarked for the L-39NG's certification campaign. In addition to test article 7002, aircraft 7001 is used for flight tests, ground vibration tests, and weapons tests. Aircraft 7003 is earmarked for fatigue tests, and aircraft 7004 for flight tests. Aircraft 7001-7003 are listed as prototypes, but 7004 will be a pre-serial production aircraft. The L-39NG is an update on the venerable L-39, gaining a Williams International FJ44-4M engine, new avionics, and five hard points for weapons.

"Australia's Qantas Group will ground 150 aircraft – including “almost all” of its widebody fleet – amid deeper capacity cuts across both its international and domestic networks. From the end of March, the airline group will cut its international capacity by about 90% – more than tripling an earlier reduction of 23% capacity it announced a week ago. Qantas Group says the decision “largely reflects the demand impact of severe quarantine requirements on people's ability to travel overseas”. In recent days, countries around the world have imposed a series of restrictions aimed at curbing the spread of the coronavirus – including locking down cities, imposing mandatory quarantines, as well as imposing travel bans. The group will also slash capacity for its domestic network by 60%, up from the earlier announced reduction of 5%. The dramatic increase in capacity cuts “reflects a rapid decline in forward travel demand due to government containment measures, corporate travel bans and a general pullback from everyday activities across the community”, Qantas Group states. Both international and domestic capacity cuts will last till the end of May. “Previously announced cuts in place from end-May through to mid-September remain in place and are likely to be increased, depending on demand,” the group adds. The capacity cuts announced on 17 March will equate to about 150 aircraft grounded across the fleet. The group, which includes budget operator Jetstar, gave no indication about how long the grounding would last. It previously announced on 10 March that it was grounding eight of its 10 Airbus A380s until September, as well as 30 other Qantas and Jetstar aircraft.

"The US Air Force (USAF) has purchased for $70.2 million two Textron Aviation Beechcraft AT-6 Wolverine aircraft for its continued light attack experiment. The turboprops were purchased using an “Other Transaction Authority” – a faster and less bureaucratic process than the conventional Pentagon acquisition procedure – and will come with pilot training, engineering services and up to four years of contractor support for maintenance and spares, says Textron on 16 March. The aircraft will be built in Wichita, Kansas. The purchase follows a similar deal with Sierra Nevada Corporation announced on 3 March. Sierra Nevada won a $129 million contract to supply two Sierra Nevada/Embraer A-29 light attack aircraft. Both Sierra Nevada and Textron are participating in the USAF's dwindling light attack experiment. The light attack experiment has evolved and diminished in scope over several years. Originally, the USAF intended to find a cheap-to-fly ground-attack aircraft. It intended to buy dozens of light attack aircraft. However, recently the initiative morphed into an effort to develop an airborne platform to carry communications equipment that would help allies coordinate air-to-ground attacks with the USA. That communications kit is called Airborne Extensible Relay Over-Horizon Network, or AERONet. The USAF envisions a system capable of providing video, voice, chat and command and control to partner nations for under $500,000 per unit. The Textron AT-6 is to be used by USAF Air Combat Command at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada, for continued testing and development of operational tactics and standards for AERONet. The Sierra Nevada A-29 will be used at Hurlburt Field in Florida, by Air Force Special Operations Command to develop an instructor pilot programme for its Combat Aviation Advisory mission. The USAF says it is getting more requests for training foreign military pilots in the use of light attack aircraft. Countries that operate light attack aircraft tend to have less sophisticated air forces with limited budgets. Light attack aircraft, such as the AT-6 and A-29, cost around or less than $1,000 hourly to fly. A-29 operators include the air forces of Brazil, Colombia, Afghanistan, Ecuador, the Dominican Republic, Indonesia, Lebanon and Nigeria. The Beechcraft T-6 Texan II aircraft, upon which the AT-6 is based, is used as a basic pilot training aircraft for countries such as the USA, Canada, the UK, Israel, Greece and Morocco. The USAF is the launch customer of the light attack variant. Correction: Colombia was misspelled.

"US President Donald Trump says his government will back airlines as they struggle to manage the fallout from the global coronavirus pandemic. “We told the airlines we are going to help them,” Trump says at a media conference on 16 March. “We have to back the airlines.” US promises aid to airlines Details about what type of help the US government might provide remain unknown. The statement came shortly after airline industry group Airlines For America (A4A) said the industry will need at least $50 billion in aid to salvage their business after cancellations outnumbered bookings by a ration of two to one. A4A represents eleven of the biggest US passenger and cargo carriers including United Airlines, Southwest Airlines, Delta Air Lines, FedEx and American Airlines. It says its members have experienced “unprecedented harm” in the past two weeks and will suffer a decline in liquidity of between $18-26 billion alone in the first six months of 2020. Regional carrier Silver Airlines, not a member of A4A, separately sent a letter to the administration as well as senators from its home state of Florida requesting aid to prop up its business. ”Our passenger bookings have dropped dramatically over the past month and we are experiencing an even greater and unprecedented decline in forward bookings each day and ever-increasing cancellations as citizens and visitors are encouraged not to travel,” the Fort Lauderdale-based airline writes. “We had expected to carry over 1,000,000 passengers in 2020, but expect to fall far short of that target.” Air Canada also asked for assistance from its own government earlier on Monday.",3,492,12.0,0.2016,"travel, government, country, coronavirus, measure, restriction, passenger, state, march, canada","['u', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'say', 'government', 'back', 'struggle', 'manage', 'fallout', 'global', 'coronavirus', 'pandemic', 'told', 'go', 'help', 'trump', 'say', 'medium', 'conference', 'march', 'back', 'u', 'promise', 'aid', 'detail', 'type', 'help', 'u', 'government', 'might', 'provide', 'remain', 'unknown', 'statement', 'come', 'shortly', 'industry', 'america', 'say', 'industry', 'need', 'least', 'aid', 'salvage', 'business', 'cancellation', 'outnumber', 'booking', 'ration', 'represent', 'eleven', 'big', 'u', 'passenger', 'cargo', 'carrier', 'include', 'united', 'southwest', 'delta', 'line', 'fedex', 'american', 'say', 'member', 'experienced', 'unprecedented', 'harm', 'past', 'week', 'suffer', 'decline', 'liquidity', 'alone', 'month', 'regional', 'carrier', 'silver', 'member', 'separately', 'sent', 'letter', 'administration', 'well', 'senator', 'home', 'state', 'florida', 'request', 'aid', 'prop', 'business', 'passenger', 'booking', 'drop', 'dramatically', 'past', 'month', 'experience', 'even', 'great', 'unprecedented', 'decline', 'forward', 'booking', 'day', 'everincreasing', 'cancellation', 'citizen', 'visitor', 'encourage', 'travel', 'fort', 'lauderdalebased', 'writes', 'expect', 'carry', 'passenger', 'expect', 'fall', 'far', 'short', 'canada', 'ask', 'assistance', 'government', 'earlier', 'monday']"
"US airlines are seeking at least $50 billion in financial aid as they manage through the coronavirus crisis, which has caused a sharp drop in demand and mounting losses for an industry accustomed to years of progressive profit growth. Airlines for America (A4A), which represents eleven of the biggest US passenger and cargo carriers including United Airlines, Southwest Airlines, Delta Air Lines, FedEx and American Airlines, says on 16 March that carriers have experienced “unprecedented harm” in the past two weeks. In a document published on its website, the trade organisation says net bookings have exceeded negative 100% for the coming months, and cancellations at some carriers are outpacing bookings two-to-one. The industry body is asking the US government for a mix of grants, loans and tax relief as carriers see their business decimated due to fears of the global pandemic's spread as well as onerous travel restrictions imposed by several countries, including the US. A4A expects its member airlines to experience a decline in liquidity of between $18 billion and $26 billion alone in the first six months of 2020. In this worst-case scenario, “all seven of A4A passenger carriers run out of money completely sometime between June 30 and the end of the year,” the association says. “Making matters even more urgent, credit card companies would likely begin withholding cash from sales before the carriers actually run out of money, effectively causing carriers to run out of money earlier than June 30.” There is discussion among airline analysts and industry experts that the US government may close the airspace to passenger carriers completely in the coming days, allowing only freight and cargo to be transported by air. Some airlines are already contemplating switching passenger flights to cargo-only flights. “A 30-day domestic travel ban would worsen our optimistic scenario by $7 billion and our pessimistic scenario by $10 billion,” the industry association says. About 750,000 people are employed by the airline industry in the United States, and many carriers have already announced measures to preserve cash reserves. These include offering voluntary unpaid leave to employees, grounding portions of their fleets and reducing new investments or delaying delivery of aircraft. Some airlines have begun to furlough pilots, and have cut capacity by 50% or more. CANADIAN REQUEST The Air Transport Association of Canada (ATAC), which represents some smaller Canadian airlines, has likewise made an “urgent appeal for immediate government financial support to the air transport industry of Canada as it deals with the COVID-19 pandemic”, according to a 16 March letter from the group to the Canadian government. ATAC's members include a host of smaller airlines, among them Porter Airlines, Flair Airlines, cargo operator Cargojet and Chorus Aviation, which owns Air Canada regional-aircraft operator Jazz Aviation. The move comes after Air Canada said earlier in the day that it intends to seek government assistance. “Government financial assistance is urgently needed to avert a crisis in the aviation industry,” the letter says. “ATAC expects that any financial aid package for the air transport industry would be made available to all air carriers. This is the only acceptable way to maintain a level playing field in such a difficult time.”",3,493,9.0,0.251,"industry, crisis, demand, coronavirus, global, iata, market, level, cargo, expect","['u', 'seek', 'least', 'financial', 'aid', 'manage', 'coronavirus', 'crisis', 'cause', 'sharp', 'drop', 'demand', 'mount', 'loss', 'industry', 'accustom', 'progressive', 'profit', 'growth', 'america', 'represent', 'eleven', 'big', 'u', 'passenger', 'cargo', 'carrier', 'include', 'united', 'southwest', 'delta', 'line', 'fedex', 'american', 'say', 'march', 'carrier', 'experienced', 'unprecedented', 'harm', 'past', 'week', 'document', 'publish', 'website', 'trade', 'organisation', 'say', 'net', 'booking', 'exceed', 'negative', 'come', 'month', 'cancellation', 'carrier', 'outpace', 'booking', 'twotoone', 'industry', 'body', 'ask', 'u', 'government', 'mix', 'grant', 'loan', 'tax', 'relief', 'carrier', 'see', 'business', 'decimate', 'due', 'fear', 'global', 'pandemic', 'spread', 'well', 'onerous', 'travel', 'restriction', 'impose', 'several', 'country', 'include', 'u', 'expect', 'member', 'experience', 'decline', 'liquidity', 'alone', 'month', 'worstcase', 'scenario', 'passenger', 'carrier', 'run', 'money', 'completely', 'sometime', 'june', 'end', 'association', 'say', 'make', 'matter', 'even', 'urgent', 'credit', 'card', 'likely', 'begin', 'withholding', 'cash', 'sale', 'carrier', 'actually', 'run', 'money', 'effectively', 'cause', 'carrier', 'run', 'money', 'earlier', 'june', 'discussion', 'among', 'analyst', 'industry', 'expert', 'u', 'government', 'may', 'close', 'airspace', 'passenger', 'carrier', 'completely', 'come', 'day', 'allow', 'freight', 'cargo', 'transport', 'already', 'contemplate', 'switch', 'passenger', 'cargoonly', 'domestic', 'travel', 'ban', 'worsen', 'optimistic', 'scenario', 'pessimistic', 'scenario', 'industry', 'association', 'say', 'people', 'employ', 'industry', 'united', 'state', 'many', 'carrier', 'already', 'announce', 'measure', 'preserve', 'cash', 'reserve', 'include', 'offering', 'voluntary', 'unpaid', 'leave', 'employee', 'ground', 'portion', 'fleet', 'reduce', 'investment', 'delay', 'delivery', 'begin', 'furlough', 'pilot', 'cut', 'capacity', 'canadian', 'request', 'transport', 'association', 'canada', 'atac', 'represent', 'small', 'canadian', 'likewise', 'make', 'urgent', 'appeal', 'immediate', 'government', 'financial', 'support', 'transport', 'industry', 'canada', 'deal', 'coronavirus', 'pandemic', 'accord', 'march', 'letter', 'canadian', 'government', 'atac', 'member', 'include', 'host', 'small', 'among', 'porter', 'flair', 'cargo', 'operator', 'cargojet', 'chorus', 'canada', 'regionalaircraft', 'operator', 'jazz', 'move', 'come', 'canada', 'say', 'earlier', 'day', 'intend', 'seek', 'government', 'assistance', 'government', 'financial', 'assistance', 'urgently', 'need', 'avert', 'crisis', 'industry', 'letter', 'say', 'atac', 'expect', 'financial', 'aid', 'package', 'transport', 'industry', 'make', 'available', 'carrier', 'acceptable', 'way', 'maintain', 'level', 'play', 'field', 'difficult']"
"Air Canada is retracting financial guidance and cutting operations as the global coronavirus pandemic hits airlines, while asking the Canadian government to help with financial losses it expects to suffer in the coming months. “The crisis facing our industry is worsening as countries around the world adopt increasingly severe measures, national lockdowns and travel restrictions,” writes chief executive Colin Rovinescu in a statement on 16 March. “We understand that the governments of the United States and many European countries such as Germany, France, Italy, Norway and others have approved or are considering assistance for their airline industries in one form or another. Under these circumstances, we believe that the Canadian airline industry should also see similar assistance, whether through forbearance of taxes, landing fees and other charges that form part of the aviation burden in Canada or otherwise until the industry stabilises,” he says. The Montreal-based flag carrier also says it is withdrawing earnings guidance for 2020 and 2021, and suspending 50% of its capacity in the second quarter of this year. “Although the company expects this disruption to be temporary, as the full impact and duration of the outbreak is unknown, Air Canada is withdrawing its previously announced first-quarter and full-year 2020 guidance as well as its full-year 2021 guidance (including its free cash flow guidance for the 2019-2021 period) while it takes steps to mitigate the financial impact on its business,” the airline says. While the airline's current cash liquidity is at about C$7.1 billion ($5.1 billion), it says it will be working “with its aircraft partners in exploring the potential deferment of aircraft deliveries” in order to preserve cash if the crisis drags on. The carrier says its capital expenditure in 2020 was planned to be C$2.4 billion, but will now be lower. “This includes purchase commitments for 17 Airbus A220 and six Boeing 737 Max aircraft totaling approximately $1.2 billion, which are still expected to be delivered and, subject to satisfactory lending arrangements, financed in 2020,” the airline says. Last week, the airline said it would be cancelling 11 of the Max orders, which had planned to be delivered in 2023 and 2024, after it reassessed its long-term fleet planning requirements in the wake of the troubled aircraft's year-long grounding.",3,494,12.0,0.2098,"travel, government, country, coronavirus, measure, restriction, passenger, state, march, canada","['canada', 'retract', 'financial', 'guidance', 'cut', 'operation', 'global', 'coronavirus', 'pandemic', 'hit', 'ask', 'canadian', 'government', 'help', 'financial', 'loss', 'expect', 'suffer', 'come', 'month', 'crisis', 'face', 'industry', 'worsen', 'country', 'around', 'world', 'adopt', 'increasingly', 'severe', 'measure', 'national', 'lockdown', 'travel', 'restriction', 'writes', 'chief', 'executive', 'colin', 'rovinescu', 'statement', 'march', 'understand', 'government', 'united', 'state', 'many', 'european', 'country', 'germany', 'france', 'italy', 'norway', 'others', 'approve', 'consider', 'assistance', 'industry', 'form', 'another', 'circumstance', 'believe', 'canadian', 'industry', 'see', 'similar', 'assistance', 'whether', 'forbearance', 'tax', 'land', 'fee', 'charge', 'form', 'part', 'burden', 'canada', 'otherwise', 'industry', 'stabilises', 'say', 'montrealbased', 'flag', 'carrier', 'say', 'withdraw', 'earnings', 'guidance', 'suspend', 'capacity', 'second', 'quarter', 'although', 'expect', 'disruption', 'temporary', 'full', 'impact', 'duration', 'outbreak', 'unknown', 'canada', 'withdraw', 'previously', 'announce', 'firstquarter', 'fullyear', 'guidance', 'well', 'fullyear', 'guidance', 'include', 'free', 'cash', 'flow', 'guidance', 'period', 'take', 'step', 'mitigate', 'financial', 'impact', 'business', 'say', 'current', 'cash', 'liquidity', 'c', 'say', 'work', 'partner', 'explore', 'potential', 'deferment', 'delivery', 'order', 'preserve', 'cash', 'crisis', 'drag', 'carrier', 'say', 'capital', 'expenditure', 'plan', 'c', 'low', 'include', 'purchase', 'commitment', 'total', 'approximately', 'still', 'expect', 'deliver', 'subject', 'satisfactory', 'lending', 'arrangement', 'finance', 'say', 'week', 'say', 'cancel', 'order', 'plan', 'deliver', 'reassess', 'longterm', 'fleet', 'planning', 'requirement', 'wake', 'troubled', 'yearlong', 'ground']"
"United Airlines has asked union leaders to support an effort to secure “government assistance”, a move coming in response to tumbling demand as the coronavirus engulfs the industry. The “call to action for government assistance” will come later this week, United's Master Executive Council (MEC), which represents the company's 13,000 pilots, says in a letter to members on 15 March. The MEC is the company's chapter of international pilot union Air Line Pilots Association. The letter says that during a 15 March call with leaders from several unions, United chief executive Oscar Munoz and president Scott Kirby “asked for labour's help”. “As we do not know the duration of this event, temporarily reducing cash burn over the short-term is critical,” Todd Insler, a United captain and chairman of the MEC, writes in the letter. “With the reduced flying, the company is doing all it can to avoid furloughs. This is one of our, and management's, primary goals.” The type of government assistant that might be requested remains unknown. United did not respond immediately to a resquest for comment. Other US airlines and US airline trade group Airlines for America also did not respond. Insler's letter says the airline's unions will be meeting with management again later this week to discuss unpaid leave and “other creative options to mitigate adverse impacts on our pilots”. The crisis, he says, is not the pilots' fault, but “it is proving to once again be our problem. We will soon be faced with difficult decisions necessary to ensure United maintains the ability to resume normal operations after this pandemic subsides”. So far, major US airlines have been quiet about asking for government assistance in the wake of the crisis which they anticipate will cost them billions of dollars over the course of the year. Over the weekend, American Airlines slashed 75% of its international capacity, and Delta Air Lines said it would be grounding 300 of its aircraft – about 30% of its fleet. United's Munoz said on Sunday his carrier too is expecting to make deep cuts, and will reduce capacity by 50% in April and May. “These drastic flight suspensions will help protect not only the public's health, but the health of ourselves, our families and fellow employees. They will also reduce United's cash burn to a more sustainable level, which is one step towards protecting the financial future of our airline,” Insler adds.",3,495,2.0,0.2458,"executive, chief, cut, add, situation, staff, crisis, make, coronavirus, employee","['united', 'ask', 'union', 'leader', 'support', 'effort', 'secure', 'government', 'assistance', 'move', 'come', 'response', 'tumble', 'demand', 'coronavirus', 'engulfs', 'industry', 'call', 'action', 'government', 'assistance', 'come', 'later', 'week', 'united', 'master', 'executive', 'council', 'mec', 'represent', 'pilot', 'say', 'letter', 'member', 'march', 'mec', 'chapter', 'international', 'pilot', 'union', 'line', 'pilot', 'association', 'letter', 'say', 'march', 'call', 'leader', 'several', 'union', 'united', 'chief', 'executive', 'oscar', 'munoz', 'president', 'scott', 'kirby', 'ask', 'labour', 'help', 'know', 'duration', 'event', 'temporarily', 'reduce', 'cash', 'burn', 'shortterm', 'critical', 'todd', 'insler', 'united', 'captain', 'chairman', 'mec', 'writes', 'letter', 'reduce', 'fly', 'avoid', 'furlough', 'management', 'primary', 'type', 'government', 'assistant', 'might', 'request', 'remains', 'unknown', 'united', 'respond', 'immediately', 'resquest', 'comment', 'u', 'u', 'trade', 'america', 'respond', 'insler', 'letter', 'say', 'union', 'meeting', 'management', 'later', 'week', 'discus', 'unpaid', 'leave', 'creative', 'option', 'mitigate', 'adverse', 'impact', 'pilot', 'crisis', 'say', 'pilot', 'fault', 'prove', 'problem', 'soon', 'face', 'difficult', 'decision', 'necessary', 'ensure', 'united', 'maintains', 'ability', 'resume', 'normal', 'operation', 'pandemic', 'subsides', 'far', 'major', 'u', 'quiet', 'ask', 'government', 'assistance', 'wake', 'crisis', 'anticipate', 'cost', 'dollar', 'course', 'weekend', 'american', 'slash', 'international', 'capacity', 'delta', 'line', 'say', 'ground', 'fleet', 'united', 'munoz', 'say', 'sunday', 'carrier', 'expect', 'make', 'deep', 'cut', 'reduce', 'capacity', 'april', 'may', 'drastic', 'suspension', 'help', 'protect', 'public', 'health', 'health', 'family', 'fellow', 'employee', 'reduce', 'united', 'cash', 'burn', 'sustainable', 'level', 'step', 'towards', 'protect', 'financial', 'future', 'insler', 'add']"
"European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen has unveiled proposals for a 30-day restriction of travel to the European Union, as well as development of a framework for state aid to affected businesses. Von der Leyen says EU member states have been taking measures intended to reduce pressure on the healthcare system created by the coronavirus outbreak. But she says that such measures are “effective only when co-ordinated”. “The less travel, the more we can contain the virus,” she states, but adds that there is a need to maintain critical flows of goods. She says that the Commission has submitted proposals to heads of state for a temporary restriction on travel to the EU, which would be in place initially for 30 days but with the possibility of extension. Long-term residents, family, and diplomats – as well as essential staff – would be exempt, as would those providing transport of goods. Von der Leyen adds that the Commission is developing a temporary framework, applicable to all EU member countries, which would allow provision of state aid “at unprecedented levels”.

"Norwegian is suspending a big majority of its services and laying off 7,300 employees as it seeks to weather the coronavirus outbreak. “The Covid-19 situation is escalating by the hour and due to stagnating demand and enforced travel restrictions by authorities worldwide, Norwegian will gradually cancel most of its flights and temporarily lay off a major share of its workforce,” the airline says. Calling the crisis “unprecedented and critical”, Norwegian's chief executive Jacob Schram states that the carrier has no choice but to “temporarily” lay off 90% of its workforce, including pilots, cabin crew, maintenance and administrative staff. “I want to emphasise that this is temporary, because when the world returns to normalcy my goal is to keep as many of our dedicated colleagues as possible,” Schram stresses. He notes that the Norwegian authorities “have communicated that they will implement all necessary measures to protect aviation in Norway, consequently securing crucial infrastructure and jobs.” From 21 March, Norwegian will fly a reduced scheduled domestically in Norway and between the Nordic capitals, as well as some European flights. All intercontinental services are cancelled except between Scandinavia and Thailand, with the last flights scheduled for the end of the month. On 13 March, the carrier asked the Norwegian government for an immediate bailout to enable it to keep flying. In a note issued the previous day, HSBC had said it expected Norwegian to face “cash-flow challenges in the near term,” given the dramatic deterioration in market conditions and the US ban on travellers from Schengen-area European countries. “Suppliers will likely take a very cautious view towards Norwegian, exacerbating cash challenges,” wrote the bank. “The likelihood of airlines being able to raise significant amounts of new equity in the present environment does not look high.”",3,497,9.0,0.2321,"industry, crisis, demand, coronavirus, global, iata, market, level, cargo, expect","['norwegian', 'suspend', 'big', 'majority', 'service', 'lay', 'employee', 'seek', 'weather', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'coronavirus', 'situation', 'escalate', 'hour', 'due', 'stagnate', 'demand', 'enforce', 'travel', 'restriction', 'authority', 'worldwide', 'norwegian', 'gradually', 'cancel', 'temporarily', 'lay', 'major', 'share', 'workforce', 'say', 'call', 'crisis', 'unprecedented', 'critical', 'norwegian', 'chief', 'executive', 'jacob', 'schram', 'state', 'carrier', 'choice', 'temporarily', 'lay', 'workforce', 'include', 'pilot', 'cabin', 'crew', 'maintenance', 'administrative', 'staff', 'want', 'emphasise', 'temporary', 'world', 'return', 'normalcy', 'goal', 'keep', 'many', 'dedicate', 'colleague', 'possible', 'schram', 'stress', 'note', 'norwegian', 'authority', 'communicate', 'implement', 'necessary', 'measure', 'protect', 'norway', 'consequently', 'secure', 'crucial', 'infrastructure', 'march', 'norwegian', 'fly', 'reduce', 'schedule', 'domestically', 'norway', 'nordic', 'capital', 'well', 'european', 'intercontinental', 'service', 'cancel', 'except', 'scandinavia', 'thailand', 'schedule', 'end', 'month', 'march', 'carrier', 'ask', 'norwegian', 'government', 'immediate', 'bailout', 'enable', 'keep', 'fly', 'note', 'issue', 'previous', 'day', 'hsbc', 'say', 'expect', 'norwegian', 'face', 'cashflow', 'challenge', 'near', 'term', 'give', 'dramatic', 'deterioration', 'market', 'condition', 'u', 'ban', 'traveller', 'schengenarea', 'european', 'country', 'supplier', 'likely', 'take', 'cautious', 'view', 'towards', 'norwegian', 'exacerbate', 'cash', 'challenge', 'write', 'bank', 'likelihood', 'able', 'raise', 'significant', 'amount', 'equity', 'present', 'environment', 'look', 'high']"
"Dutch investigators have concluded that a Boeing 747-400ERF crew was startled by an engine compressor stall during the take-off roll, and consequently failed to reduce thrust in time to prevent a runway excursion. The Turkish-registered MyCargo Airlines aircraft had been operating from Maastricht, bound for Jeddah, on behalf of Saudia Cargo on 11 November 2017. As the aircraft accelerated along runway 21 it experienced a compressor stall in the outer right-hand General Electric CF6 engine at about 30kt, causing the thrust of the powerplant to drop to around 20% of N1. While the first officer urged the captain, who was flying, to abort the take-off, he did not mention the loss of thrust. The aircraft yawed to the right as a result of the asymmetric thrust. “The [captain] had no information and was unaware of the cause of the deviation,” says the Dutch Safety Board. “As a result, he was surprised and he reacted intuitively.” He used the nose-wheel steering tiller and rudder pedals, as well as differential braking, in a bid to guide the 747 back to the centreline. But crucially, says the inquiry, the thrust levers were “not immediately retarded to idle”. The captain used his left hand to turn the tiller and took his right hand off the thrust levers to hold the control column. Flight-data recorder information shows the thrust levers, as a result, were only retarded about 8s after the power loss. Simulations of the flight were conducted by investigators, which demonstrated that if the power of the remaining engines is maintained for just 4s, the aircraft's tendency to yaw to the right “cannot be corrected”. With asymmetric thrust acting on the 747 for twice this length of time, and other standard procedures not followed, controlling the jet became “impossible”, says the inquiry, and a runway excursion was “inevitable”. The jet veered off the right side of the runway and came to a halt on grass. Investigators state that the crew appears to have experienced the “startle effect”, whereby a sudden an unexpected occurrence results in a delayed and incorrect response. “Each year, crews are trained in rejected take-offs at low speed following an engine failure,” says the inquiry. “However, no 'startle effects' will occur during these training sessions as the flight crews know what to expect.” No definite cause for the compressor stall has been determined, although the probe has ruled out foreign object damage and turbulence. “The technical state of the engine as found might have contributed to this event,” it states. None of the four occupants of the jet (TC-ACR) was injured. But the 747 sustained substantial structural damage including deformed skin panels and stringers, and deformation to the nose-wheel well web.",3,498,7.0,0.4388,"crew, runway, inquiry, land, approach, accident, investigator, captain, incident, pilot","['dutch', 'investigator', 'conclude', 'crew', 'startle', 'engine', 'compressor', 'stall', 'takeoff', 'roll', 'consequently', 'fail', 'reduce', 'thrust', 'prevent', 'runway', 'excursion', 'turkishregistered', 'mycargo', 'operating', 'maastricht', 'bound', 'jeddah', 'behalf', 'saudia', 'cargo', 'november', 'accelerate', 'along', 'runway', 'experienced', 'compressor', 'stall', 'outer', 'righthand', 'general', 'electric', 'engine', 'cause', 'thrust', 'powerplant', 'drop', 'around', 'officer', 'urge', 'captain', 'fly', 'abort', 'takeoff', 'mention', 'loss', 'thrust', 'yawed', 'right', 'result', 'asymmetric', 'thrust', 'captain', 'information', 'unaware', 'cause', 'deviation', 'say', 'dutch', 'safety', 'board', 'result', 'surprised', 'react', 'use', 'nosewheel', 'steer', 'tiller', 'rudder', 'pedal', 'well', 'differential', 'brake', 'bid', 'guide', 'back', 'centreline', 'crucially', 'say', 'inquiry', 'thrust', 'lever', 'immediately', 'retard', 'idle', 'captain', 'use', 'left', 'hand', 'turn', 'tiller', 'take', 'right', 'hand', 'thrust', 'lever', 'hold', 'control', 'column', 'flightdata', 'recorder', 'information', 'thrust', 'lever', 'result', 'retard', 'power', 'loss', 'simulation', 'conduct', 'investigator', 'demonstrate', 'power', 'remain', 'engine', 'maintain', 'tendency', 'yaw', 'right', 'correct', 'asymmetric', 'thrust', 'act', 'twice', 'length', 'standard', 'procedure', 'follow', 'control', 'jet', 'become', 'impossible', 'say', 'inquiry', 'runway', 'excursion', 'inevitable', 'jet', 'veer', 'right', 'side', 'runway', 'come', 'halt', 'grass', 'investigator', 'state', 'crew', 'appear', 'experienced', 'startle', 'effect', 'whereby', 'sudden', 'unexpected', 'occurrence', 'result', 'delayed', 'incorrect', 'response', 'crew', 'train', 'reject', 'takeoff', 'low', 'speed', 'follow', 'engine', 'failure', 'say', 'inquiry', 'however', 'effect', 'occur', 'training', 'session', 'crew', 'know', 'definite', 'cause', 'compressor', 'stall', 'determine', 'although', 'probe', 'rule', 'foreign', 'object', 'damage', 'turbulence', 'technical', 'state', 'engine', 'found', 'might', 'contribute', 'event', 'state', 'none', 'occupant', 'jet', 'tcacr', 'injured', 'sustain', 'substantial', 'structural', 'damage', 'include', 'deform', 'skin', 'panel', 'stringer', 'deformation', 'nosewheel', 'well', 'web']"
"Air France is to ground its Airbus A380s and its Dutch sibling carrier KLM its full Boeing 747 fleet as part of wider capacity cuts the group expects will result in in potential cuts in its ASK capacity of between 70% and 90%. The cuts follow the tightening of travel restrictions in Europe generally, and the group's home nations of France and the Netherlands specifically, in response to the coronavirus crisis. Notably that includes the French government's move to a level 3 public health emergency requiring the closure of all non-essential services. ”Faced with these growing restrictions on the possibility of travelling and a strong downward trend in demand which has resulted in a drop in traffic and sales over the last few weeks, the Air France-KLM Group is obliged to gradually reduce its flight activity very significantly over the next few days, with the number of available seat kilometres potentially decreasing between -70% and -90%,” the airline group says. ”This reduction in capacity is currently scheduled to last two months, and the group will continue to monitor the evolution of the situation on a daily basis and adjust it if necessary,” it adds. Specifically Air France and KLM are grounding their biggest capacity aircraft fleets, the A380 and 747s respectively. Air France had began reducing its 10-strong A380 fleet (above) just prior to the crisis, with one of four aircraft already earmarked for retirement being flown to Knock in Ireland in February.  Cirium's fleets data shows KLM operates seven 747s - a mix of passenger and combi versions - with a further aircraft in storage. Whilst the group highlights a number of actions it has taken to “secure its cash flow” since the crisis began, it says these savings are likely to only offset around half the expected drop in passenger revenues. ”In spite of the measures taken, the deterioration of the environment linked to the epidemic and the sharp reduction in its activity that has resulted today lead the group to forecast a sharply deteriorated financial trajectory compared to the outlook presented at the publication of its annual results. ”Indeed, the group estimates that the drop in revenues from the Passenger business resulting from the reduction in capacity will only be offset by around 50% by the drop in variable costs before cost savings measures. “In this extremely difficult context, the Air France-KLM Group has welcomed the statements made by the French and Dutch governments, which have each indicated that they were studying all possible means to support the group.”",3,499,3.0,0.2196,"passenger, loss, operating, revenue, traffic, month, increase, capacity, decline, result","['france', 'ground', 'dutch', 'sibling', 'carrier', 'klm', 'full', 'fleet', 'part', 'wider', 'capacity', 'cut', 'expect', 'result', 'potential', 'cut', 'ask', 'capacity', 'cut', 'follow', 'tighten', 'travel', 'restriction', 'europe', 'generally', 'home', 'nation', 'france', 'netherlands', 'specifically', 'response', 'coronavirus', 'crisis', 'notably', 'include', 'french', 'government', 'move', 'level', 'public', 'health', 'emergency', 'require', 'closure', 'nonessential', 'service', 'face', 'grow', 'restriction', 'possibility', 'travel', 'strong', 'downward', 'trend', 'demand', 'result', 'drop', 'traffic', 'sale', 'week', 'franceklm', 'oblige', 'gradually', 'reduce', 'activity', 'significantly', 'next', 'day', 'number', 'available', 'seat', 'kilometre', 'potentially', 'decrease', 'say', 'reduction', 'capacity', 'currently', 'schedule', 'month', 'continue', 'monitor', 'evolution', 'situation', 'daily', 'basis', 'adjust', 'necessary', 'add', 'specifically', 'france', 'klm', 'ground', 'big', 'capacity', 'fleet', 'respectively', 'france', 'begin', 'reduce', 'fleet', 'prior', 'crisis', 'already', 'earmark', 'retirement', 'flown', 'knock', 'ireland', 'february', 'fleet', 'data', 'klm', 'operates', 'mix', 'passenger', 'combi', 'version', 'far', 'storage', 'whilst', 'highlight', 'number', 'action', 'take', 'secure', 'cash', 'flow', 'since', 'crisis', 'begin', 'say', 'saving', 'likely', 'offset', 'around', 'half', 'expect', 'drop', 'passenger', 'revenue', 'spite', 'measure', 'take', 'deterioration', 'environment', 'link', 'epidemic', 'sharp', 'reduction', 'activity', 'result', 'today', 'lead', 'forecast', 'sharply', 'deteriorate', 'financial', 'trajectory', 'compare', 'outlook', 'present', 'publication', 'annual', 'result', 'indeed', 'estimate', 'drop', 'revenue', 'passenger', 'business', 'result', 'reduction', 'capacity', 'offset', 'around', 'drop', 'variable', 'cost', 'cost', 'saving', 'measure', 'extremely', 'difficult', 'context', 'franceklm', 'welcome', 'statement', 'make', 'french', 'dutch', 'government', 'indicate', 'study', 'possible', 'mean', 'support']"
"Icelandair Group is expecting a summer season capacity cut of at least 25% on the previous forecasts, and is working with unions to secure salary reductions. The airline operates a business model based on transatlantic connections via Reykjavik, and has been hit by US-European travel restrictions linked to the coronavirus outbreak. Icelandair Group says it has already adjusted capacity by up to 30% and that this is likely to be trimmed further while such restrictive measures are in effect. The operator is experiencing “significantly decreased” demand on its markets and is assuming capacity for the summer, while uncertain, will still be 25% lower, at least, than previously estimated. It has not been able to determine the financial impact of the situation. Icelandair Group points out that its overall liquidity has remained at around $300 million, as it was at the end of last year, but says it is expecting negative effects on cash-flow over the next few weeks.

"Korean Air is using passenger aircraft as freighters on suspended routes, as it seeks “new opportunities in the market amid unpredictable changes such as suspensions of flights and the US' restrictions on European countries”. On 13 March, the flag carrier transported emergency supplies and agricultural products from South Korea to Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, plying a route that has been suspended from 3 March. This was flown on a passenger Airbus A330-300 capable of carrying 20 tonnes of cargo. Korean Air will also deploy more cargo flights to Qingdao, China from 21 March, using passenger aircraft that it says have been idle from 25 February. It plans to expand destinations and cargo types. Last week, the carrier confirmed that 100 of 145 passenger aircraft in its fleet have been grounded, and this includes ten A380s that will remain out of service until 25 April. It says in the latest statement: “Flight suspensions and reductions due to Covid-19 have led airlines to park passenger aircraft at airports. The entry restrictions of many countries on passengers departing from [South] Korea has led to the suspension of 89 of Korean Air's 124 routes as of March 13. “The number of operating international flights has been reduced to approximately 86% following a decrease in demand.” Korean states that Hanjin Group chairman, Walter Cho, proposed the idea of using passenger aircraft as freighters to “overcome the current crisis, as this would cut down expenses and support import and export companies.” Cho said: “As the Covid-19 situation becomes increasingly dire, it is important for us to take a new perspective when looking at the market. “If we use the cargo compartment of our parked passenger aircraft, not only can we respond to the changing demand of cargo transport by diversifying our cargo routes, but we can also reduce aircraft parking fees.” He added: “The business strategies of passenger and cargo should be shifted as the trans-Atlantic [air routes are] now blocked. We must flexibly respond to market demand.” In a similar move, Cathay Pacific is considering operating cargo-only services on passenger jets to Japan, following significant cuts to the passenger network. In a client notice sent last week, Cathay's cargo arm says it expects capacity cuts to impact passenger belly cargo operations but is looking at ways to “continue serving our cargo customers to and from Japan”. “This includes the retention of certain passenger services for cargo carriage only,” the notice read.",3,501,5.0,0.231,"carrier, march, international, outbreak, suspend, capacity, schedule, april, united, coronavirus","['korean', 'use', 'passenger', 'freighter', 'suspend', 'route', 'seek', 'opportunity', 'market', 'amid', 'unpredictable', 'change', 'suspension', 'u', 'restriction', 'european', 'country', 'march', 'flag', 'carrier', 'transport', 'emergency', 'supply', 'agricultural', 'product', 'south', 'korea', 'ho', 'chi', 'minh', 'city', 'vietnam', 'ply', 'route', 'suspend', 'march', 'flown', 'passenger', 'capable', 'carry', 'tonne', 'cargo', 'korean', 'deploy', 'cargo', 'qingdao', 'march', 'use', 'passenger', 'say', 'idle', 'february', 'plan', 'expand', 'destination', 'cargo', 'type', 'week', 'carrier', 'confirm', 'passenger', 'fleet', 'ground', 'include', 'remain', 'service', 'april', 'say', 'late', 'statement', 'suspension', 'reduction', 'due', 'coronavirus', 'lead', 'park', 'passenger', 'airport', 'entry', 'restriction', 'many', 'country', 'passenger', 'depart', 'south', 'korea', 'lead', 'suspension', 'korean', 'route', 'march', 'number', 'operating', 'international', 'reduce', 'approximately', 'follow', 'decrease', 'korean', 'state', 'hanjin', 'chairman', 'walter', 'cho', 'propose', 'idea', 'use', 'passenger', 'freighter', 'overcome', 'current', 'crisis', 'cut', 'expense', 'support', 'import', 'export', 'cho', 'say', 'coronavirus', 'situation', 'becomes', 'increasingly', 'dire', 'important', 'u', 'take', 'perspective', 'look', 'market', 'use', 'cargo', 'compartment', 'park', 'passenger', 'respond', 'change', 'demand', 'cargo', 'transport', 'diversify', 'cargo', 'route', 'reduce', 'parking', 'add', 'business', 'strategy', 'passenger', 'cargo', 'shift', 'transatlantic', 'route', 'block', 'must', 'flexibly', 'respond', 'market', 'similar', 'move', 'cathay', 'pacific', 'consider', 'operating', 'cargoonly', 'service', 'passenger', 'jet', 'japan', 'follow', 'significant', 'cut', 'passenger', 'network', 'client', 'notice', 'sent', 'week', 'cathay', 'cargo', 'arm', 'say', 'expect', 'capacity', 'cut', 'impact', 'passenger', 'belly', 'cargo', 'operation', 'look', 'way', 'continue', 'serve', 'cargo', 'customer', 'japan', 'include', 'retention', 'certain', 'passenger', 'service', 'cargo', 'carriage', 'notice', 'read']"
"Vietnam Airlines has decided it will carry passengers from Europe, but will take significant precautions amid the global coronavirus outbreak. Passenger services from London, Paris, and Frankfurt are part of what the carrier says is an effort “to uphold its national responsibilities.” The statement, issued on 15 March, came one day after a separate statement where the carrier said that it would operate flights to Europe in order for tourists to return to their home countries, but that the aircraft would fly back to Vietnam empty. Prior to embarking for Vietnam, passengers will undergo temperature screening and an interview. They will be required to wear face masks and gloves during the flight. Their condition will be monitored while in the air and they will undergo post-flight quarantine after landing. “All the flight crew members will be equipped with specialised medical protective clothing,” adds the carrier. “For passenger and crew safety, only drinks and dry snacks are served. These flights will land at predetermined airports in Vietnam after Vietnam Airlines has come to an official decision with the competent authorities.” Another Vietnam Airlines statement, issued on 13 March, had said that from 25 March, the carrier will reduce its European capacity from 14 services weekly. This statement added that the Vietnamese government had unilaterally suspended visa exemptions for Denmark, Norway, Finland, Sweden, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, and Spain.

"United Airlines will reduce capacity by half in April and May and has cut executive officers' salaries 50% in response to a pandemic United's executives say makes operating an airline “nearly impossible”. “When medical experts say that our health and safety depends on people staying home and practicing social distancing, it's nearly impossible to run” an airline, United's two top executives said in a 15 March letter to employees. The letter from chief executive Oscar Munoz and president Scott Kirby disclosed the airline's plan to cut capacity “approximately” 50% in the next two months – cuts more drastic than previously disclosed by US carriers. United operated 777 aircraft at the end of 2019 and carried 162 million passengers that year, according to securities filings. “We also now expect these deep cuts to extend into the summer travel period,” says the letter. “Even with those cuts, we're expecting load factors to drop into the 20-30% range – and that's if things don't get worse.” The news came shortly after the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended that, for eight weeks, gatherings of 50 or more people be cancelled or postponed. “Large events and mass gatherings can contribute to the spread of COVID-19 in the United States via travellers who attend these events and introduce the virus to new communities,” says the CDC's guidance, which does not mention air travel. The letter from Munoz and Kirby to employees says United's corporate officers were notified on 15 March that their salaries will be cut 50%. “The bad news is that it's getting worse. We expect both the number of customers and revenue to decline sharply in the days and weeks ahead,” the letter adds. United has also started talking to employee groups about cutting payroll costs. “This weekend, we began conversations with our union leadership about how to reduce our payroll expense in a way that minimises what we know will be painful for all of us,” says the letter. Also on 15 March, Hawaiian Airlines said it will suspend flights from Honolulu to Austrialia and New Zealand starting this month. The airline cites those countries' decisions to impose a 14-day “self-isolation entry requirement” on arriving travellers. Hawaiian flies five-times weekly to Sydney and three-times weekly to both Brisbane and Auckland. United, like airlines globally, had previously announced capacity cuts in response to the coronavirus outbreak, which has left US schools and businesses, like those in many other countries, shuttered. United had already slashed transpacific and transatlantic capacity, and had previously planned to cut domestic capacity 20% in April and May.

"Philippine Airlines (PAL) has urged the US Department of Transport (DOT) to expedite its application to launch a Manila-Seattle service. This comes after United Airlines appealed to the same department to delay PAL's request, until the US carrier gains commercially viable slots at Manila Ninoy Aquino International airport (NAIA). PAL had intended to start a thrice-weekly Manila-Seattle service by 3 May, according to an application made to the DOT on 27 January and seen by Cirium. It also has the support of the Port of Seattle, which owns and operates Seattle-Tacoma International airport. In a letter dated 10 February, United explained that it has not been able to gain “commercially viable slots and necessary airport infrastructure” needed to add another daily Guam-Manila frequency. Although the Star Alliance member was not opposed to PAL's application to start the Seattle service, it highlighted that PAL had managed to start nonstop Manila-New York, and raise frequencies on flights to Los Angeles and San Francisco unhindered. To that, PAL emphasised that NAIA is a slot-coordinated airport, where the process is managed by a third-party slot coordinator while terminal access is handled by the Manila International Airport Authority. It also noted of United's attempts to “hold hostage beneficial first nonstop service between Seattle and Manila,” in its response to United comments, dated 18 February. Since then, there has been no further updates on the route application at the regulations.gov website managed by the US government. The disagreement between PAL and United has been brewing since November 2019, when United objected to a request made by PAL Express to codeshare on PAL-operated Manila-Guam flights. Similarly, United raised the issue of not being able to expand its Guam-Manila service. Cirium schedules data shows that United flies between Manila and Guam nine-times weekly.

"American Airlines has slashed 75% of its international capacity in response to the drop-off in demand as the global coronavirus crisis continues. Between 16 March and 6 May, the Fort Worth-based carrier will continue to operate just one daily flight each from Dallas and Miami to London Heathrow, it says on 14 March, in response to expanded travel restrictions from Europe to the US. Earlier on Saturday, the US government announced that its European travel ban had been expanded to encompass Ireland and the UK, beginning on 16 March. That is in addition to the ban, which took effect 14 March, on passengers from 26 other continental European countries. American adds that it will continue to operate three flights per week from Dallas to Tokyo. Those will be the only American non-stop connections between the United States and Asia. Furthermore, the airline will suspend numerous, but not all, direct flights from its John F Kennedy, Miami and Dallas/Fort Worth hubs to several cities in South America, including Sao Paolo, Rio de Janiero, Bogota, Quito and Lima. For the moment, short-haul international flights to Canada, Central America, the Caribbean and parts of northern South America will continue as normal, American says. “In addition to the international changes, the airline anticipates its domestic capacity in April will be reduced by 20% compared to last year and May's domestic capacity will be reduced by 30% on a year over year basis,” the airline says. On Sunday, United Airlines pared some flights to London and Ireland from its schedule following the extended travel restrictions. From 20 March until at least the end of April, the Chicago-based carrier intends to operate just three daily flights to London and one daily flight to Dublin. The three daily London flights will depart from Newark, San Francisco and Washington Dulles, the airline says. Prior to the adjustment, United operated 18 daily flights between the UK and the US, and three daily flights to Dublin. United will continue flying daily from the USA to Zurich, Brussels, Paris and Amsterdam, four-times weekly to Lisbon and “multiple” flights to Frankfurt and Munich. Earlier in the week, Delta said it would be grounding 300 of its 910-strong fleet and significantly reduce its direct flights to continental Europe. On Sunday, it added that the only European destinations it will serve in the coming weeks will be Paris, Amsterdam, and London Heathrow.

"Business aviation exhibition EBACE 2020 has been cancelled as a consequence of the coronavirus situation, more than two months ahead of its scheduled opening date. The event was due to take place in Geneva from 26-28 May. Both the European Business Aviation Association and the National Business Aviation Association have “closely monitored” the spread of the outbreak and, in particular, its effect on travel and large public gatherings. Swiss authorities have tightened restrictions on large-scale events, banning gatherings of more than 100 people until the end of April, says the Swiss Federal Council. The Council had previously restricted events to gatherings of 1,000 people until 15 March, but has since reviewed the measure. “We view our participants as partners, whose health and well-being is our foremost concern,” says NBAA president Ed Bolen. The two co-sponsoring partners have agreed that exhibit and registration fees will be refunded in full. “This is the hardest decision EBAA's management and board of governors have had to make in years,” says EBAA secretary-general Athar Husain Khan said. “But given the unprecedented circumstances, we had no other choice.” EBACE is a key event in the business aviation calendar, with some 50 aircraft on display and 400 exhibitors, drawing some 13,000 attendees. Meanwhile, May's other big European show – the ILA Berlin event – is also doubtful. German federal and regional authorities have introduced several restrictions banning events of 1,000 people or more, however, these are of varying or unspecified duration. “We are currently examining the consequences and are holding intensive discussions with our partners and organisers of guest events. As of now, the ILA Berlin is planned from May 13th – 17th, 2020,” say the show's organisers. The future of Chile's FIDAE air show is also uncertain: Santiago banned events of more than 500 people on Friday 13 March, but the show's organisers have yet to update its website. Indeed, at the time of writing, the website appeared to be down for maintenance.

"Air Baltic is to temporarily suspend flights from 17 March until 14 April following the Latvian government's decision to suspend international air traffic as part of measures to counter the coronavirus crisis. Latvia's government today stepped up its action to counter the spread of the virus. That includes measures suspending international travel from 17 March to all but Latvian nationals and residents returning to the country, or foreign nationals seeking to leave the country. Against this backdrop, Air Baltic has announced it will temporarily suspend flights. ”The safety and health of our passengers, our employees and the society is above all,” says Air Baltic chief executive Martin Gauss. “Air Balticis working intensively to assist all passengers affected. Due to the amount of rebookings needed, we ask for understanding from our customers that we are doing our utmost to deal with this extraordinary situation.” The suspension applies to Air Baltic's Estonian operations in addition to its Latvian flights. The Latvian carrier had on 11 March already announced plans to temporarily cut its 1,600-strong workforce by up to 250 personnel in a measure to stave off the impact of the coronavirus outbreak. ”Following the already announced staff reductions, Air Baltic will in the upcoming days be in continued discussions with our staff and unions on details, how the new situation will affect the employment and future of our employees,” the airline says.

Northern Italy was the first region in Europe to face lockdown measures, which spread into national lockdown across Italy earlier this month. ”All passengers are informed that starting from Monday 16 March, Milan Linate airport will be temporarily closed,” SEA says. ”Commercial aviation traffic will be concentrated in Terminal 2 of Milan Malpensa airport.” Terminal 1 at Malpensa airport is also being closed.

"Alitalia is to enforce the wearing of protective masks on board flights if load factors mean passengers cannot be adequately spaced. The Italian flag-carrier has imposed the measure with immediate effect, part of the effort to combat the coronavirus outbreak which has affected Italy particularly badly. Alitalia is having to cope with severe restrictions to its operations as the government attempts to bring the situation under control. Passengers will be asked to provide themselves with a protective mask before boarding, and such masks “must be worn” if a large number of passengers means a 1m (3ft) interpersonal spacing cannot be maintained. Alitalia warns that it could deny boarding to passengers who do not have a mask in their possession. “[We recommend] travellers wear protective breathing masks also at airports and during boarding and disembarking from aircraft,” the carrier adds. “Health and safety of travellers and employees has always been Alitalia's top priority.” Alitalia says it has taken steps to increase disinfection activities on its fleet, and its aircraft also carry biohazard kits with which cabin crew can deal with passengers suspected to be ill.",3,509,12.0,0.333,"travel, government, country, coronavirus, measure, restriction, passenger, state, march, canada","['alitalia', 'enforce', 'wear', 'protective', 'mask', 'board', 'load', 'factor', 'mean', 'passenger', 'adequately', 'space', 'italian', 'flagcarrier', 'impose', 'measure', 'immediate', 'effect', 'part', 'effort', 'combat', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'affected', 'italy', 'particularly', 'badly', 'alitalia', 'cope', 'severe', 'restriction', 'operation', 'government', 'attempt', 'bring', 'situation', 'control', 'passenger', 'ask', 'provide', 'protective', 'mask', 'boarding', 'mask', 'must', 'worn', 'large', 'number', 'passenger', 'mean', 'interpersonal', 'space', 'maintain', 'alitalia', 'warns', 'deny', 'boarding', 'passenger', 'mask', 'possession', 'recommend', 'traveller', 'wear', 'protective', 'breathing', 'mask', 'airport', 'boarding', 'disembark', 'carrier', 'add', 'health', 'safety', 'traveller', 'employee', 'always', 'alitalia', 'top', 'alitalia', 'say', 'take', 'step', 'increase', 'disinfection', 'activity', 'fleet', 'carry', 'biohazard', 'kit', 'cabin', 'crew', 'deal', 'passenger', 'suspect', 'ill']"
"US travel restrictions will be expanded to individuals coming from the UK and Ireland as the coronavirus continues to disrupt the industry in ways that seemed unimaginable just days ago. President Donald Trump advised on 14 March that ”it's going to happen“ and the measure was subsequently confirmed by vice-president Mike Pence. The expansion comes three days after the US government said it would be stopping foreign visitors from much of continental Europe from entering the country for 30 days beginning on 13 March. The expanded restrictions for the UK and Ireland are expected to apply to this group as well. US citizens and permanent residents are permitted to return to the country under the ban, but must enter the USA via one of 13 “gateway airports” where they will be medically screened. These airports comprise: Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Dallas-Fort Worth, Detroit, Honolulu, Los Angeles, Miami, New York JFK, Newark, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington Dulles. American Airlines said on 12 March it was suspending up to 34% of its international capacity, with a 50% capacity decline to Europe during the month of April.

"As the coronavirus crisis increases panic in Europe and North America, airports across the US are struggling to assist passengers affected by canceled flights as they grapple with the financial effects of the virus on their industry in the coming months. Airport industry group Airports Council International - North America (ACI) says on 13 March it expects US airports alone to experience a total loss of $5.8 billion in 2020 as a result of the global COVID-19 pandemic. “Passenger traffic volume at US commercial airports is estimated to decrease by approximately 40% in the March to June period, which translates to about a 29% decrease in the first half of 2020 and 20% for the full year compared to forecasted 2020 levels without COVID-19,” ACI says on 13 March. “In absolute terms, in the first half of 2020, total passenger enplanement is anticipated to decrease by 130 million and 190 million for the full year.” After US president Donald Trump announced expanded restrictions for travellers from Europe earlier this week, it was unclear as to what exactly that meant, and to whom they would apply. Administration officials later clarified the travel ban would only affect foreign nationals without citizenship or permanent resident status in the US. That effectively shuts down the foreign tourism business from Europe's 26 Schengen Area countries for at least 30 days beginning on 13 March. These include economically powerful and travel-savvy populations in nations such as Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark, France and Switzerland. The United Kingdom and Ireland are exempt from the list. At San Francisco International airport, there was initially “some confusion about who the Presidential Proclamation applies to,” says spokesman Doug Yokel. San Francisco, however, remains open and is one of the 13 US ”gateway airports” or “approved entry points” to which travelers can return directly from overseas travel. Yokel says the airport has seen a decline in passenger traffic of 25% since the same time last year and some international flights have already been suspended. “The affected countries amount to about 15% of our international flight schedule and it remains to be seen how much of that gets suspended,” Yokel adds Philadelphia International airport, on the East Coast and closer to Europe, says as of Friday afternoon it has only experienced 11 cancellations. “Collectively, the 26 countries in the Schengen Area make up only .04% of PHL's passenger volume,” airport spokeswoman Flo Brown says. However, from Friday at midnight, Philadelphia will not be able to accept nonstop flights from Europe as it is not on the list of the 13 gateway airports. The 13 locations where US citizens can directly enter the country are the international airports in the following cities: Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Dallas/Fort Worth, Detroit, Honolulu, Los Angeles, Miami, New York (John F Kennedy), Newark, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, DC (Dulles). American Airlines said on Thursday it is suspending up to 34% of its international capacity, with a 50% capacity decline to Europe during the month of April. Delta said on Friday that it was cutting 40% of capacity and grounding 300 jets, about one third of its fleet. Airlines have capped one-way fares from Europe since yesterday, in order to prevent price gouging. They are also offering flexible rebooking policies as well as immediate travel credit for use in the future. Social media users in Europe and across North America have been reporting long lines at information and service kiosks and counters at airports, and hours-long waits on telephone customer service lines. At German hub Frankfurt International airport, passenger numbers in the first week of March dropped by 30% in the aftermath of the coronavirus outbreak, the airport's operator Fraport said on Thursday. In Slovakia, Bratislava and two other international airports – Kosice and Poprad – closed to all operations at least for two weeks, in response to the coronavirus situation.

"UK accident investigators have concluded that the pilot of the doomed Piper Malibu PA-46-310P (N264DB) that crashed on 21 January 2019 in the sea off Guernsey carrying Argentinian footballer Emiliano Sala was not licensed to fly the aircraft at the time of the accident and was conducting an illegal charter. David Ibbotson was also likely to have been suffering from the effects of carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning in the latter stages of the flight, which would have impaired his ability to control the aircraft. In its final report into the incident, published on 13 March, the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) determined that Ibbotson was flying on a US Federal Aviation Administration private pilot's licence (PPL) - issued on the basis of his European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) PPL - and was only qualified to fly in daylight hours under visual flight rules (VFR). However, the single-engined pilot rating on his EASA licence - issued by the UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) - expired in November 2018, rendering Ibbotson unqualified to undertake the flight. The AAIB also concludes that Ibbotson had been ”paid a fee for flights on numerous occasions”, and was to be paid  for the “accident flight”, although as a PPL holder he was not qualified to carry passengers for hire and reward. “The regulations under which the aircraft was operated and maintained permitted it to be used for private use only,” says the AAIB. It notes that no permission had been sought or granted which allowed the US-registered aircraft to be operated commercially. “A higher level of regulatory burden applies to commercial, compared with private flights, such as more stringent medical, licensing and airworthiness requirements,” says the AAIB. A PPL holder flying a passenger for financial gain would be operating an illegal charter, it adds. Ibbotson had no experience in commercial or night flying. He also lacked practice in instrument flying, says the AAIB. “It is likely that pilot felt some pressure to complete the return leg of the flight, even though it would be at night and in poor weather,” it adds. Ibbotson flew Sala in the 1984-built Malibu from Cardiff, Wales to Nantes, France on 19 January, with a return flight scheduled to depart two days later. The report notes that N264DB was equipped with an ice-protection system that allowed it to fly into known icing conditions. The six-seat aircraft was also fitted with avionics that allowed it to be flown safely at night in instrument meteorological conditions, however the autopilot and flight director had been diagnosed with an intermittent fault “and should have been placarded as inoperative”, says the AAIB. Ibbotson's planned route on 21 January would have taken the aircraft on an almost direct track from Nantes, flying over Guernsey, the report says. The VFR flightplan indicated a cruise altitude of 6,000ft and a distance of 265nm (490km). The aircraft departed at 19:15 local, climbing to 5,500ft in line with the flightplan. The forecast showed a cold front moving in from the northwest, with the possibility of isolated showers during the flight. At 20:02, and around 13nm south of Guernsey, Ibbotson requested a descent to remain in visual meteorological conditions. Ibbotson then requested permission from air traffic control to fly at a lower level to maintain visibility. He was cleared to fly at 5,000ft, and when asked if a further descent was required, Ibbotson responded: “Negative. Just avoided a patch there but back on heading 5,000ft.” Once the aircraft had passed to the north of Guernsey, there would have been few lights visible from the surface vessels in the English Channel, says the report. “At an altitude at which the aircraft was flying, the horizon would have been visible between 80nm (150km) and 90nm away in perfect conditions, but there was rain and moisture in the atmosphere which would have obscured the horizon and reduced this distance significantly,” it adds. The last radio communication received from the aircraft was at 20.12 when Ibbotson asked for, and was granted permission to, reduce altitude again. “A series of turns was flown over about 90sec probably so that the aircraft would remain in or regain VMC. During the turns, the flightpath was unstable and inconsistent with normal cruise flight, or with use of the autopilot,” says the report. The aircraft's last recorded secondary radar point was 20:16. Radar readings show the aircraft began a turn to the right, and descend. “As it descended through approximately 2,700ft above mean sea level, the angle of bank was approximately 90 degrees and the airspeed around 235kt [435km/h],” says the report. AAIB describes the altitude and speed of the Piper as “far from typical values encountered in normal operations”. This indicates, it says, that the autopilot was not engaged and “control of the aircraft had been lost”. Around 30s later, as the aircraft descended below 2,700ft, there was an abrupt nose-up pitch input when the airspeed was at least 100kt above the designed manoeuvring speed. “During the subsequent pull-up manoeuvre, aerodynamic loads exceeded design limits and caused the structural failure of the elevator and horizontal stabiliser, followed by the structural failure of both wings and splice joints,” says the report. The final secondary radar contact with the aircraft was at 20:16:34. The aircraft struck the sea in an inverted, left wing low, nose-high attitude. “The impact with the sea was not survivable,” says the AAIB. A loss of control was made more likely because the flight was not conducted “in accordance with safety standards applicable to commercial operations,” says the report. “This manifested itself in the flight being operated under VFR at night, in poor weather conditions despite the pilot having no training in night flying and a lack of recent practice in instrument flying.” The Malibu was located on the seabed by sonar on 3 February, before a submersible with cameras dived at the site and was able to confirm it was the missing aircraft. Video footage from the AAIB shows the aircraft in three parts, with the wreckage held together by electrical and flying control cables, and the engine disconnected from the cockpit area. Sala's body was recovered from the wreckage on 6 February, but Ibbotson has not been located. Toxicology tests on Sala's body found he has been exposed to potentially lethal levels of carbon monoxide which may have also have incapacitated Ibbotson. CO is a colourless, odourless gas that can be produced by combustion engines. “It readily combines with haemoglobin in the blood, decreasing the carriage of oxygen and causing a direct effect on the performance of those parts of the body which rely on oxygen for proper function,” says the AAIB. The most likely reason for CO to have entered the aircraft, according to the report, “was a failure of the part of the exhaust tailpipe containing the heater muff, which allowed exhaust gas to mix the ram air and enter the cabin through the cabin conditioning system”. The exhaust system, including the heater muff was visually inspected during the annual maintenance, 11 flying hours before the accident, the investigation shows. However, it adds that in-service inspections of exhaust systems do not eliminate the risk of CO poisoning. The AAIB has issued a number of recommendations in relation to the accident. Firstly, that EASA, the FAA and the CAA require piston-engined aircraft which may have risk of CO poisoning to have a detector with an active warning fitted which will alert pilots to the presence of elevated levels of the gas. It also recommends that the CAA has an effective system in place to maintain “accurate and up-to-date records related to personnel licences, certificates and ratings.” ",3,512,7.0,0.3619,"crew,

"Leonardo is currently unable to deliver helicopters built at its plant in Vergiate in the north of Italy, as a result of travel restrictions imposed due to the coronavirus outbreak. This means that customer pilots are unable to collect the completed rotorcraft, says chief executive Alessandro Profumo. “Clearly at this very moment the acceptance of helicopters cannot be realised because the crews of our customers cannot fly,” Profumo told a full-year earnings call on 13 March. He says the company cannot forecast when deliveries might resume, nor if a production slow-down or suspension will be required, due to uncertainty about how long the coronavirus crisis will persist. Leonardo Helicopters builds the majority of its products at Vergiate, although it also has additional final assembly capacity in Philadephia. Profumo says that around 8,000 white-collar employees are currently working from home, while the company is taking additional precautions at its various production plants across Italy. Crucially, however, there has been no suspension in activities at any site, including the final assembly and check out facility for the Lockheed Martin F-35 in Cameri near Turin or its plant in Grottaglie in southern Italy, which produces large sections for the Boeing 787. In addition, there has been no disruption to Leonardo's supply chain, says Profumo, although it is managing inventory carefully as a precaution. However, Profumo says that commercial campaigns have been hit by travel restrictions, although he notes that it is difficult at this stage to predict the impact across the year.",3,513,0.0,0.2775,"order, business, jet, delivery, production, customer, deliver, commercial, quarter, include","['leonardo', 'currently', 'unable', 'deliver', 'helicopter', 'built', 'plant', 'vergiate', 'north', 'italy', 'result', 'travel', 'restriction', 'impose', 'due', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'mean', 'customer', 'pilot', 'unable', 'collect', 'complete', 'rotorcraft', 'say', 'chief', 'executive', 'alessandro', 'profumo', 'clearly', 'moment', 'acceptance', 'helicopter', 'realise', 'crew', 'customer', 'fly', 'profumo', 'told', 'fullyear', 'earnings', 'call', 'march', 'say', 'forecast', 'delivery', 'might', 'resume', 'production', 'slowdown', 'suspension', 'require', 'due', 'uncertainty', 'long', 'coronavirus', 'crisis', 'persist', 'leonardo', 'helicopter', 'build', 'majority', 'product', 'vergiate', 'although', 'additional', 'final', 'assembly', 'capacity', 'philadephia', 'profumo', 'say', 'around', 'whitecollar', 'employee', 'currently', 'work', 'home', 'take', 'additional', 'precaution', 'various', 'production', 'plant', 'across', 'italy', 'crucially', 'however', 'suspension', 'activity', 'site', 'include', 'final', 'assembly', 'check', 'facility', 'lockheed', 'martin', 'cameri', 'near', 'turin', 'plant', 'grottaglie', 'southern', 'italy', 'produce', 'large', 'section', 'addition', 'disruption', 'leonardo', 'supply', 'chain', 'say', 'profumo', 'although', 'manage', 'inventory', 'carefully', 'precaution', 'however', 'profumo', 'say', 'commercial', 'campaign', 'hit', 'travel', 'restriction', 'although', 'note', 'difficult', 'stage', 'predict', 'impact', 'across']"
"Norwegian is asking the government in Oslo for an immediate bailout as it struggles to cope with the coronavirus outbreak that is decimating travel demand. “We're in a very demanding situation at the moment,” states chief executive Jacob Schram. “We need exact measures to strengthen our liquidity in the short term immediately.” While the carrier welcomes a move to suspend some taxes levied on airlines such as passenger fees, “it is crucial for us that the government will work on solutions for a phase two. We are asking for these solutions to come quickly,” Schram says. Norwegian is willing to take “all measures necessary” to reduce its losses, he continues, “no matter how painful they are.” The Norwegian government has said that it could be open to providing the industry with financial help in other ways, press reports say, although no details have been announced. Market turmoil means that Norwegian is unable to turn to investors to raise equity or issue debt in order to secure new liquidity, “which means that it is not possible to finance businesses in a normal fashion”. The carrier highlights that it has undergone significant restructuring over the past year and has sold 24 aircraft. It also has a low share of fuel hedging, locking only 25% of its expected fuel consumption – which could see it benefit from a recent fuel price reduction. In a note to clients issued yesterday, HSBC said that it expected Norwegian to face “cash flow challenges in the near term,” given the dramatic deterioration in market conditions and the US ban on travellers from Schengen-area European countries. “Suppliers will likely take a very cautious view towards Norwegian, exacerbating cash challenges. The likelihood of airlines being able to raise significant amounts of new equity in the present environment does not look high.”",3,514,9.0,0.2815,"industry, crisis, demand, coronavirus, global, iata, market, level, cargo, expect","['norwegian', 'ask', 'government', 'oslo', 'immediate', 'bailout', 'struggle', 'cope', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'decimate', 'travel', 'demand', 'demand', 'situation', 'moment', 'state', 'chief', 'executive', 'jacob', 'schram', 'need', 'exact', 'measure', 'strengthen', 'liquidity', 'short', 'term', 'carrier', 'welcome', 'move', 'suspend', 'tax', 'levy', 'passenger', 'fee', 'crucial', 'u', 'government', 'work', 'solution', 'phase', 'ask', 'solution', 'come', 'quickly', 'schram', 'say', 'norwegian', 'willing', 'take', 'measure', 'necessary', 'reduce', 'loss', 'continue', 'matter', 'painful', 'norwegian', 'government', 'say', 'open', 'provide', 'industry', 'financial', 'help', 'way', 'press', 'report', 'say', 'although', 'detail', 'announce', 'market', 'turmoil', 'mean', 'norwegian', 'unable', 'turn', 'investor', 'raise', 'equity', 'issue', 'debt', 'order', 'secure', 'liquidity', 'mean', 'possible', 'finance', 'business', 'normal', 'fashion', 'carrier', 'highlight', 'undergone', 'significant', 'restructuring', 'past', 'sell', 'low', 'share', 'fuel', 'hedge', 'lock', 'expect', 'fuel', 'consumption', 'see', 'benefit', 'recent', 'fuel', 'price', 'reduction', 'note', 'client', 'issue', 'yesterday', 'hsbc', 'say', 'expect', 'norwegian', 'face', 'cash', 'flow', 'challenge', 'near', 'term', 'give', 'dramatic', 'deterioration', 'market', 'condition', 'u', 'ban', 'traveller', 'schengenarea', 'european', 'country', 'supplier', 'likely', 'take', 'cautious', 'view', 'towards', 'norwegian', 'exacerbate', 'cash', 'challenge', 'likelihood', 'able', 'raise', 'significant', 'amount', 'equity', 'present', 'environment', 'look', 'high']"
"Turboprop manufacturer ATR plans to deliver the same number of aircraft in 2020 as the previous year. Italy's Leonardo – a partner in the joint venture with Airbus – records 68 deliveries in 2019, along with taking in 65 orders: 24 for the ATR 72-600 and 41 for the smaller ATR 42-600. Rival De Havilland Canada recorded respective figures of 19 and 15 for its competing Dash 8-400. Alessandra Genco, Leonardo chief financial officer, says that this year's production plan is “in line with 2019”, but notes that prior to the coronavirus outbreak, the objective was for a “slight increase” in deliveries. “What we are seeing now is a temporary slowdown in conversations with customers in Southeast Asia associated with slower traffic of Chinese tourists in the region,” she told analysts on a 13 March full-year earnings call. However, she stresses that it is too early to tell “how the year will unfold”, and points out that the “fundamentals of the business and strength of ATR as a product remain untouched”. ATR has a 75% share of the turboprop market, she notes.

"American Airlines has accelerated the retirement of its 767s and 757s. It now plans to ground 767s in May and 757s by the second half of 2021. The move comes in response to the downturn caused by the coronavirus outbreak. The carrier disclosed the early retirements in a 12 March employee memo in which executives said the airline must respond decisively to the outbreak.  American operates 16 767-300ERs (above) and 34 757-200s (below), according to Cirium fleets data.  The 757 retirements will begin in May and be complete by “post summer 2021 at the latest”, says the memo, signed by American chief executive Doug Parker and president Robert Isom. “We will accelerate the retirement of our remaining Boeing 757 and 767 aircraft. Doing so removes older, less fuel-efficient aircraft from our fleet sooner than originally planned and avoids unnecessary maintenance and fuel costs,” the memo says. “Coronavirus...has hurt demand for travel around much of the world. While we have moved quickly to reduce our schedule to match demand, it's become clear that more is needed.” American announced the groundings the same day it said it is cutting a host of routes, including those to some South American cities, and to Europe from Charlotte and Philadelphia.

"Frankfurt Main airport's operator, Fraport, says passenger numbers in the first week of March dropped by 30% in the aftermath of the coronavirus outbreak. The figure for the German hub had declined by 4% during February, although there was an accelerating negative trend towards the end of the month with a 14.5% fall in the final week. Fraport says the outbreak has led to “massive” flight cancellations and “very weak” demand in both European and intercontinental traffic. It says it has embarked on cost-saving measures, with expenditure being “rigorously reviewed” and limited only to that essential for business operations. Hiring of new personnel has been suspended and staff have been asked to rearrange shifts, or even postpone them until summer or autumn, while some employees are being offered voluntary unpaid leave. The company had been expecting Frankfurt Main passenger numbers to remain flat this year, before the coronavirus crisis, but it is instead forecasting a “significant slump” – with a €10-14 impact on EBTDA for each missing passenger. “We have to assume that the strong decline in air traffic volumes will continue during the next few weeks and months,” says executive board chair Stefan Schulte, adding that the company cannot provide detailed financial guidance for the full year 2020.

Rob Morris, head of consultancy Ascend by Cirium, warned on 12 March that the amount of cash that airlines had to hand would be a crucial factor in whether they could survive. “Airlines that don't have cash, ways of accessing liquidity, are going to struggle,” he said.",3,519,9.0,0.2323,"industry, crisis, demand, coronavirus, global, iata, market, level, cargo, expect","['franceklm', 'withdrawn', 'full', 'available', 'revolve', 'credit', 'facility', 'look', 'shore', 'cash', 'reserve', 'face', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'fund', 'renewable', 'request', 'sixmonth', 'period', 'november', 'give', 'liquidity', 'immediately', 'available', 'meet', 'possible', 'change', 'environment', 'say', 'theair', 'franceklm', 'grouphas', 'always', 'base', 'financial', 'strategy', 'longterm', 'financing', 'high', 'cash', 'reserve', 'supplement', 'significant', 'liquidity', 'line', 'provide', 'major', 'bank', 'add', 'since', 'coronavirus', 'crisis', 'begin', 'franceklm', 'say', 'sought', 'limit', 'impact', 'virus', 'profitability', 'preserve', 'financial', 'flexibility', 'liquidity', 'concern', 'risen', 'across', 'sector', 'recent', 'day', 'rob', 'morris', 'head', 'consultancy', 'ascend', 'warn', 'march', 'amount', 'cash', 'hand', 'crucial', 'factor', 'whether', 'survive', 'cash', 'way', 'access', 'liquidity', 'go', 'struggle', 'say']"
"Israeli flag-carrier El Al is facing industrial action from its personnel towards the end of this month, heaping pressure on the airline as it battles to deal with the coronavirus impact. The airline says it received, on 12 March, formal notification of a labour dispute and possible strike from 27 March onwards. It follows the collapse of negotiations with the trade union organisation Histadrut, which has confirmed its declaration of the dispute. “The grounds for the dispute is the impasse in negotiations between Histadrut and the [airline's] management regarding steps to be take due to the coronavirus outbreak crisis,” it adds. Histadrut claims El Al has shown “lack of good faith” by rejecting proposals put forward from the organisation and its work council on behalf of its staff. It argues that El Al is seeking to use the crisis to force through “significant changes” which will violate collective agreements and other arrangements. El Al warned in early March that it would need to “adjust its activities” to cope with a fall in revenues, and that it had started discussing reduction of salaries, cuts to the workforce, and freezing of hiring across the company, including at management level.",3,520,2.0,0.2386,"executive, chief, cut, add, situation, staff, crisis, make, coronavirus, employee","['israeli', 'flagcarrier', 'el', 'al', 'face', 'industrial', 'action', 'personnel', 'towards', 'end', 'month', 'heap', 'pressure', 'battle', 'deal', 'coronavirus', 'impact', 'say', 'receive', 'march', 'formal', 'notification', 'labour', 'dispute', 'possible', 'strike', 'march', 'onwards', 'follow', 'collapse', 'negotiation', 'trade', 'union', 'organisation', 'histadrut', 'confirm', 'declaration', 'dispute', 'ground', 'dispute', 'impasse', 'negotiation', 'histadrut', 'management', 'regard', 'step', 'take', 'due', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'crisis', 'add', 'histadrut', 'claim', 'el', 'al', 'lack', 'good', 'faith', 'reject', 'proposal', 'put', 'forward', 'organisation', 'work', 'council', 'behalf', 'staff', 'argues', 'el', 'al', 'seek', 'use', 'crisis', 'force', 'significant', 'change', 'violate', 'collective', 'agreement', 'arrangement', 'el', 'al', 'warn', 'early', 'march', 'need', 'adjust', 'activity', 'cope', 'fall', 'revenue', 'start', 'discuss', 'reduction', 'salary', 'cut', 'workforce', 'freeze', 'hire', 'across', 'include', 'management', 'level']"
"African operator Fastjet Group expects to meet all preconditions, by the end of March, for divesting its Zimbabwean division and complete the transaction in April. It says participants of an investor consortium led by Solenta Aviation Holdings remain “committed” to the acquisition of Fastjet Zimbabwe under previously-agreed terms. Fastjet Group has nevertheless had to negotiate deferral of repayments and settlement discounts with its main creditors as a result of delays to the divestment. Based on these revised creditor terms and financial projections the company believes it will have “sufficient resources” to meet operational needs until the end of June. But it adds that this depends on its forecast revenues not being badly affected by the outbreak of the coronavirus. The company is monitoring demand closely for booking patterns arising from the outbreak and states that contingency plans to mitigate the effects on its business are “already in place”. It had cash reserves of $2.2 million as of 11 March, and warns: “The headroom of available cash resources remains minimal and the projections remain very sensitive to any assumptions not being met or any significant downturn in business.” If Fastjet Group is unable to complete the Fastjet Zimbabwe divestment or raise additional capital by the end of June, it says, the company will be unable to continue trading as a going concern.",3,521,8.0,0.2699,"government, uk, carrier, business, state, share, south, airway, financial, plan","['african', 'operator', 'fastjet', 'expect', 'meet', 'precondition', 'end', 'march', 'divest', 'zimbabwean', 'division', 'complete', 'transaction', 'april', 'say', 'participant', 'investor', 'consortium', 'lead', 'solenta', 'holding', 'remain', 'commit', 'acquisition', 'fastjet', 'zimbabwe', 'previouslyagreed', 'term', 'fastjet', 'nevertheless', 'negotiate', 'deferral', 'repayment', 'settlement', 'discount', 'main', 'creditor', 'result', 'delay', 'divestment', 'base', 'revise', 'creditor', 'term', 'financial', 'projection', 'believe', 'sufficient', 'resource', 'meet', 'operational', 'need', 'end', 'june', 'add', 'depends', 'forecast', 'revenue', 'badly', 'affected', 'outbreak', 'coronavirus', 'monitoring', 'demand', 'closely', 'book', 'pattern', 'arise', 'outbreak', 'state', 'contingency', 'plan', 'mitigate', 'effect', 'business', 'already', 'place', 'cash', 'reserve', 'march', 'warns', 'headroom', 'available', 'cash', 'resource', 'remains', 'minimal', 'projection', 'remain', 'sensitive', 'assumption', 'met', 'significant', 'downturn', 'fastjet', 'unable', 'complete', 'fastjet', 'zimbabwe', 'divestment', 'raise', 'additional', 'capital', 'end', 'june', 'say', 'unable', 'continue', 'trading', 'go', 'concern']"
"Washington state has passed legislation that reduces tax breaks bestowed on Boeing and other aerospace companies, a change the airframer insists brings it into compliance with World Trade Organization rules. The European Union has for years been pursuing a WTO suit against Boeing. That suit claimed Boeing has received $3.8 billion in Washington state tax breaks since 2003, plus subsidies from Kansas, NASA and the US Department of Defense, at the expense of Airbus. “Today's repeal by Washington state of its aerospace business and occupation tax rate brings the United States into full WTO compliance by fixing the single finding against the US, further emphasising our commitment to free and fair trade,” Boeing says. “We applaud Washington state leaders for their partnership in ensuring full compliance with WTO rulings.”  Boeing's widebody facility in Everett, Washington Airbus says: “After 14 years of denial, finally there is a clear admission that there have been WTO-inconsistent subsidies from Washington state. “While this was long overdue, it's still up to the WTO to rule on whether this step actually removes all the Washington state subsidies the WTO has found violated WTO law,” the European manufacturer adds. “We applaud Washington state and Boeing for seeming to take some initial steps towards removing illegal subsidies to Boeing.” The bill, which must be signed by Washington's governor, increases the state tax rate on aerospace companies from 0.2904% to 0.357% – still less than the base rate on manufacturing companies of 0.484%. The 0.2904% rate has been in effect since 2003. However, the legislature makes the tax rate change is dependent upon conditions being met. Those conditions include that the USA and EU agree to resolve ongoing disputes involving commercial aircraft. Also, the US-EU agreement must “expressly” permit the 0.357% rate, the legislature says. Airbus says more remains to be done. “We look forward to hearing how [the United States Trade Representative] will remove the billions of other illegal subsidies identified in the WTO rulings, including the subsidies granted by the state of Kansas, NASA and [Department of Defense], and the hundreds of millions of annual federal tax breaks to Boeing.”",3,522,12.0,0.3228,"travel, government, country, coronavirus, measure, restriction, passenger, state, march, canada","['washington', 'state', 'pass', 'legislation', 'reduces', 'tax', 'break', 'bestow', 'change', 'airframer', 'insists', 'brings', 'compliance', 'world', 'trade', 'organization', 'rule', 'european', 'union', 'pursue', 'wto', 'suit', 'suit', 'claimed', 'receive', 'washington', 'state', 'tax', 'break', 'since', 'plus', 'subsidy', 'kansa', 'nasa', 'u', 'department', 'defense', 'expense', 'today', 'repeal', 'washington', 'state', 'business', 'occupation', 'tax', 'rate', 'brings', 'united', 'state', 'full', 'wto', 'compliance', 'fix', 'single', 'find', 'u', 'far', 'emphasise', 'commitment', 'free', 'fair', 'trade', 'say', 'applaud', 'washington', 'state', 'leader', 'partnership', 'ensure', 'full', 'compliance', 'wto', 'widebody', 'facility', 'everett', 'washington', 'say', 'denial', 'finally', 'clear', 'admission', 'wtoinconsistent', 'subsidy', 'washington', 'state', 'long', 'overdue', 'still', 'wto', 'rule', 'whether', 'step', 'actually', 'remove', 'washington', 'state', 'subsidy', 'wto', 'found', 'violate', 'wto', 'law', 'european', 'manufacturer', 'add', 'applaud', 'washington', 'state', 'seem', 'take', 'initial', 'step', 'towards', 'remove', 'illegal', 'subsidy', 'bill', 'must', 'sign', 'washington', 'governor', 'increase', 'state', 'tax', 'rate', 'still', 'less', 'base', 'rate', 'manufacturing', 'rate', 'effect', 'since', 'however', 'legislature', 'make', 'tax', 'rate', 'change', 'dependent', 'upon', 'condition', 'met', 'condition', 'include', 'usa', 'eu', 'agree', 'resolve', 'ongoing', 'dispute', 'involve', 'commercial', 'useu', 'agreement', 'must', 'expressly', 'permit', 'rate', 'legislature', 'say', 'say', 'remains', 'look', 'forward', 'hearing', 'united', 'state', 'trade', 'representative', 'remove', 'illegal', 'subsidy', 'identify', 'wto', 'ruling', 'include', 'subsidy', 'grant', 'state', 'kansa', 'nasa', 'department', 'defense', 'hundred', 'annual', 'federal', 'tax', 'break']"
"As the coronavirus crisis rapidly disrupts airline operations worldwide, major US carriers are taking measures to prevent price gouging for passengers desperate to return to the USA before travel restrictions between Europe and the US take effect on Friday. “We currently have change fee waivers in place for any customers traveling domestically and internationally through April 30,” United Airlines says in a statement on 12 March. “For those trying to get home from Europe, we have capped fares between the US and Europe. Importantly, we will continue to fly our regular schedule from Europe to the US through March 19.” “After that, we expect to fly daily to Zurich, Brussels, Paris, Amsterdam, Manchester and Edinburgh, maintain multiple flights to Frankfurt and Munich, and operate 18 daily flights to and from London, three to Dublin and less than daily service to Lisbon, all while continuing to monitor demand,” United adds. American Airlines also responded to the massive demand of travelers looking to return to the US prior to the new entry restrictions. “We have capped our Main Cabin fares from Europe and the UK at a maximum of 799 EUR/GBP ($893/$1,004) and fares from the US have been capped at $1,000,” American says in a statement, also on Thursday. “These fares include taxes and fees that are typically around $250 to $300 on transatlantic routes. We are also offering reasonably priced fares for our premium cabins on our transatlantic routes.” Delta Air Lines says it too is putting a lid on fares from Europe. It will also suspend several connections between Paris and Amsterdam and US cities. Almost 40 airlines operate a combined roughly 560 passenger flights daily, carrying some 160,000 seats, in both directions, between the USA and continental Europe, excluding the United Kingdom, according to Cirium schedules data. That equates to nearly 17,000 flights and 4.8 million seats in the 30-day period during which the travel ban is set to be in effect. American, United and Delta alone operate more than 200 daily flights between the USA and mainland Europe. Earlier in the day, numerous Twitter users posted about chaos at European airports and massively inflated prices for westbound tickets as the demand for seats from Europe to the United States spiked overnight. The US government surprised many European leaders on 11 March by declaring US borders closed for 30 days to travellers who have recently visited 26 European countries. The ban encompasses travellers from Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland, according to the US Department of Homeland Security. US president Donald Trump claimed on 11 March that the EU had “failed to take the same precautions” as the USA regarding travel restrictions on China and other regions at risk. As a result, he said, infection clusters in the USA were “seeded” by travellers originating in Europe.

"IATA has warned governments must be ready to provide support to counter the impact of travel bans implemented to counter the coronavirus outbreak, warning measures such as the ban imposed by the USA were not included in its recent worse-case scenario for the financial hit to the industry. US President Donald Trump in an 11 March Oval Office address announced his government will halt all passenger travel and cargo transport from Europe for 30 days, beginning on 13 March. The ban applies only to foreign nationals who have been in certain European countries encompassing the Schengen agreement for 14 days before their scheduled arrival in the USA, he says. It does not apply to US citizens, permanent residents or immediate relatives of citizens. It follows similar travel restricting measures introduced inIsrael, Kuwaitand Spain. “These are extraordinary times and governments are taking unprecedented measures,” says IATA director general Alexandre de Juniac. ”Safety – including public health – is always a top priority. Airlines are complying with these requirements. Governments must also recognise that airlines – employing some 2.7 million people – are under extreme financial and operational pressures. They need support.” The association is urging government to weigh up the financial implications of such action as well as whether it is in line with the World Health Organisation (WHO) guidance – which it notes continues to advise against the application of travel or trade restrictions to countries experiencing outbreaks. “We urge the US and other governments that have placed travel restrictions to follow the WHO guidance,” says de Juniac. ”This is fast evolving. Health and safety are the top priorities for governments and the air transport sector. But the effectiveness and necessity of travel restrictions must be continuously reviewed.” When taking such measures, IATA is urging governments to prepare for the adverse economic impact that they will cause. It notes the dimensions of the US-Europe market are enormous. “Governments must impose the measures they consider necessary to contain the virus,” says de Juniac. ”And they must be fully prepared to provide support to buffer the economic dislocation that this will cause. ”In normal times, air transport is a catalyst for economic growth and development. Suspending travel on such a broad scale will create negative consequences across the economy. Governments must recognize this and be ready to support.” IATA had already raised its initial expectations of how big an impact the outbreak could have on the airline industry this year. Notably its 5 March worst-case guidance – which suggested $113 billion could be wiped off airline revenues in 2020 –  and this did not account for measures subsequently put in place by the USA and other governments. ”The US measures will add to this financial pressure. The total value of the USA-Schengen market in 2019 was $20.6 billion,” IATA says. It notes the markets facing the heaviest impact are USA-Germany ($4 billion), USA-France ($3.5 billion) and USA-Italy ($2.9 billion). “This will create enormous cash-flow pressures for airlines,” warns de Juniac. ”We have already seen Flybe go under. And this latest blow could push others in the same direction. ”Airlines will need emergency measures to get through this crisis,” he adds. ”Governments should be looking at all possible means to assist the industry through these extreme circumstances. Extending lines of credit, reducing infrastructure costs, lightening the tax burden are all measures that governments will need to explore. ”Air transport is vital, but without a lifeline from governments we will have a sectoral financial crisis piled on top of the public health emergency,” says de Juniac.",3,524,12.0,0.3779,"travel, government, country, coronavirus, measure, restriction, passenger, state, march, canada","['iata', 'warn', 'government', 'must', 'ready', 'provide', 'support', 'counter', 'impact', 'travel', 'ban', 'implement', 'counter', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'warn', 'measure', 'ban', 'impose', 'usa', 'include', 'recent', 'worsecase', 'scenario', 'financial', 'hit', 'industry', 'u', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'march', 'oval', 'office', 'address', 'announce', 'government', 'halt', 'passenger', 'travel', 'cargo', 'transport', 'europe', 'day', 'begin', 'march', 'ban', 'applies', 'foreign', 'national', 'certain', 'european', 'country', 'encompass', 'schengen', 'agreement', 'day', 'schedule', 'arrival', 'usa', 'say', 'apply', 'u', 'citizen', 'permanent', 'resident', 'immediate', 'relative', 'citizen', 'follow', 'similar', 'travel', 'restrict', 'measure', 'introduce', 'inisrael', 'kuwaitand', 'spain', 'extraordinary', 'government', 'take', 'unprecedented', 'measure', 'say', 'iata', 'director', 'general', 'alexandre', 'de', 'juniac', 'safety', 'include', 'public', 'health', 'always', 'top', 'priority', 'comply', 'requirement', 'government', 'must', 'recognise', 'employ', 'people', 'extreme', 'financial', 'operational', 'pressure', 'need', 'association', 'urge', 'government', 'weigh', 'financial', 'implication', 'action', 'well', 'whether', 'line', 'world', 'health', 'organisation', 'guidance', 'note', 'continue', 'advise', 'application', 'travel', 'trade', 'restriction', 'country', 'experience', 'outbreak', 'urge', 'u', 'government', 'place', 'travel', 'restriction', 'follow', 'guidance', 'say', 'de', 'juniac', 'fast', 'evolve', 'health', 'safety', 'top', 'priority', 'government', 'transport', 'sector', 'effectiveness', 'necessity', 'travel', 'restriction', 'must', 'continuously', 'take', 'measure', 'iata', 'urge', 'government', 'prepare', 'adverse', 'economic', 'impact', 'cause', 'note', 'dimension', 'useurope', 'market', 'enormous', 'government', 'must', 'impose', 'measure', 'consider', 'necessary', 'contain', 'virus', 'say', 'de', 'juniac', 'must', 'fully', 'prepared', 'provide', 'support', 'buffer', 'economic', 'dislocation', 'cause', 'normal', 'transport', 'catalyst', 'economic', 'growth', 'development', 'suspend', 'travel', 'broad', 'scale', 'create', 'negative', 'consequence', 'across', 'economy', 'government', 'must', 'recognize', 'ready', 'iata', 'already', 'raise', 'initial', 'expectation', 'big', 'impact', 'outbreak', 'industry', 'notably', 'march', 'worstcase', 'guidance', 'suggest', 'wipe', 'revenue', 'account', 'measure', 'subsequently', 'put', 'place', 'usa', 'government', 'u', 'measure', 'add', 'financial', 'pressure', 'total', 'value', 'usaschengen', 'market', 'iata', 'say', 'note', 'market', 'face', 'heaviest', 'impact', 'usagermany', 'usafrance', 'usaitaly', 'create', 'enormous', 'cashflow', 'pressure', 'warns', 'de', 'juniac', 'already', 'see', 'flybe', 'go', 'late', 'blow', 'push', 'others', 'direction', 'need', 'emergency', 'measure', 'get', 'crisis', 'add', 'government', 'look', 'possible', 'mean', 'assist', 'industry', 'extreme', 'circumstance', 'extend', 'line', 'credit', 'reduce', 'infrastructure', 'cost', 'lighten', 'tax', 'burden', 'measure', 'government', 'need', 'explore', 'transport', 'vital', 'without', 'lifeline', 'government', 'sectoral', 'financial', 'crisis', 'pile', 'top', 'public', 'health', 'emergency', 'say', 'de', 'juniac']"
"Israeli flag-carrier El Al is unable to estimate the impact of new government requirements that people returning to Israel from anywhere in the world must enter 14-day quarantine. The requirement will have a “material adverse effect” on El Al's operations, the airline says. “But at this stage [we are] unable to assess the extent of the impact,” it adds. El Al is continuing – like many airlines – to adjust its route network and operations to align with demand for flights, but says it expects cancellation of “many” of its scheduled services. Israel's pilots association is insisting that the government “must come to the rescue” of the country's aviation industry, and help protect its airlines from the coronavirus threat. El Al has been holding extensive negotiations with workers through the Histadrut trade union organisation. But Histadrut says the airline's management, after two days of talks, has “rejected” an offer from staff to provide $1 billion in “painful” concessions over a seven-year period. “I am worried about El Al's fate,” says Histdrut chairman Arnon Bar-David, claiming that the airline has turned down all the proposals it had generated through discussion with the carrier's staff. Local media in Israel, citing internal documents, claim El Al is to temporarily lay off 80% of its workforce.

"Norwegian is grounding 40% of its long-haul fleet and cancelling some 25% of its short-haul services in response to the coronavirus outbreak and the US ban on European travellers. The Scandinavian low-cost carrier is also cutting up to 50% of its staff as it looks at “all possible measures to reduce costs”. Norwegian is suspending the majority of its long-haul flights from continental Europe to the USA following travel restrictions imposed by the US authorities to counter the coronavirus, but its transatlantic flights from London Gatwick are not impacted In the period 13-29 March, Norwegian is cancelling the majority of its long-haul flights to the USA from Amsterdam, Barcelona, Madrid, Oslo, Paris and Stockholm. From 13 March to the end of May, flights from Rome to the USA are cancelled, and the same applies to US services from Amsterdam, Athens, Barcelona, Madrid, Oslo and Paris between 29 March and the end of April. Routes from London Gatwick to the USA are unaffected. “Our goal is to reroute as many of our customers as possible through London during this difficult period,” says the airline. “This is an unprecedented situation,” states chief executive Jacob Schram. “Our main priority continues to be the care and safety of our customers and colleagues. The new restrictions imposed further pressure on an already difficult situation. “We urge international governments to act now to ensure that the aviation industry can protect jobs and continue to be a vital part of the global economic recovery.” Norwegian is also cancelling a “large share” of its domestic Norwegian flights and services within Scandinavia, such as from Oslo to Copenhagen and Stockholm. Flights to Italy will also be cancelled. In a move which appears contradictory, “domestic and intra-Scandinavian flights will be combined to re-protect our customers”, says Norwegian. HSBC, in a note published today, sounded a warning on Norwegian's liquidity position: “We now expect Norwegian to face cash-flow challenges in the near term.

"Virgin Atlantic has abruptly retired its three remaining Airbus A340-600s in the wake of the collapse in passenger traffic caused by the coronavirus outbreak. The move brings to an end almost three decades of operations of Airbus's four-engined widebody, which began in 1993 with the smaller A340-300.  The airline was the launch operator for the Rolls-Royce Trent 500-powered -600 (above), taking delivery of first example in mid-2002 - which it famously marketed with the slogan “4 Engines 4 Long Haul”. The fleet peaked at 19 aircraft between 2007 and 2010, according to Cirium fleets data. Virgin's fleet of the CFM International CFM56-powered A340-300 expanded to six aircraft from 1997. That fleet gradually declined as the -600s arrived, with the last aircraft divested in 2010. The -600s replaced Virgin's older Boeing 747s, but were themselves succeeded by the arrival of new widebody twinjets – 787s and A330s. However, the UK airline slowed the retirement of the A340-600 amid the disruption to its 787 fleet caused by issues with their Trent 1000 engines. FlightGlobal understands that prior to the coronavirus crisis, the airline had planned to retain its last A340s until the end of the 2020 summer season in October. By 2019, the -600 fleet had declined to three aircraft. Cirium shows that Virgin's three remaining A340-600s (G-VFIT, G-VWIN and G-VNAP) were put into storage in early March. Virgin declines to comment on the retirement of the type, saying it is “unable to confirm anything at present”.",3,527,4.0,0.2227,"airport, fleet, service, data, carrier, operation, passenger, number, operate, operator","['virgin', 'atlantic', 'abruptly', 'retire', 'remain', 'wake', 'collapse', 'passenger', 'traffic', 'cause', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'move', 'brings', 'end', 'almost', 'decade', 'operation', 'fourengined', 'widebody', 'begin', 'small', 'launch', 'operator', 'rollsroyce', 'trent', 'take', 'delivery', 'example', 'famously', 'market', 'slogan', 'engine', 'long', 'haul', 'fleet', 'peaked', 'accord', 'fleet', 'data', 'virgin', 'fleet', 'cfm', 'international', 'expand', 'fleet', 'gradually', 'decline', 'arrive', 'divest', 'replace', 'virgin', 'old', 'succeed', 'arrival', 'widebody', 'twinjet', 'however', 'uk', 'slow', 'retirement', 'amid', 'disruption', 'fleet', 'cause', 'issue', 'trent', 'engine', 'flightglobal', 'understands', 'prior', 'coronavirus', 'crisis', 'plan', 'retain', 'end', 'summer', 'season', 'october', 'fleet', 'decline', 'virgin', 'remain', 'gvfit', 'gvwin', 'gvnap', 'put', 'storage', 'early', 'march', 'virgin', 'decline', 'comment', 'retirement', 'type', 'say', 'unable', 'confirm', 'anything', 'present']"
"Italian airports operator Aeroporti di Roma (ADR) is to temporarily close the scheduled passenger terminal at Rome Ciampino airport from midnight on 13 March and one of the terminals at the city's primary Fiumicino gateway. It follows the collapse in air travel demand to and within Italy amid the spiralling impact of the coronavirus crisis in the country, which prompted the Italian government to implement a country-wide lockdown on 10 March. That decision expanded restrictions, previously centred on the heavily impacted northern Italy region, to the whole country. Airlines had already heavily cut Italian air services, even beyond northern Italian gateways, but subsequently pulled services across Italy as a result of the country-wide lockdown. ADR, which operates Rome's two airports, detailed its plan to meet downsized operations at both Fiumicino and Ciampino airports. “The decision was made necessary due to the multiple cancellations of flights to and from Italy announced by many airlines that normally operate on the two airports of the capital,” it says. It will from the start of Saturday 14 March close the passenger terminal at Ciampino airport - the city's secondary airport popular with budget carriers. Ciampino will remain open to general aviation, state flights and cargo operations. From 17 March, Terminal 1 at Fiumicino will close. The other terminal at the airport will remain open. ”The passenger terminals of Fiumicino and Ciampino airports will resume regular operations as soon as the current emergency phase is over,” ADR adds.

"European Union leaders have condemned the US government's sudden 30-day transatlantic travel ban, set to be introduced on 13 March. President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen says the coronavirus crisis is “not limited to any continent” and combating the threat “requires co-operation” rather than one-sided action. “The European Union disapproves of the fact that the US decision to impose a travel ban was taken unilaterally and without consultation,” she says, in a joint statement with European Council president Charles Michel. US president Donald Trump claimed on 11 March that the EU had “failed to take the same precautions” as the USA regarding travel restrictions on China and other regions at risk. As a result, he says, infection clusters in the USA were “seeded” by travellers originating in Europe. “Taking early intense action, we have seen dramatically fewer cases of the virus in the [USA] than are now present in Europe,” he claims.

"Investigators probing a Swiss Airbus A220 low-thrust incident during departure at Porto found that the pilots only belatedly realised that the autothrottle had not engaged before the take-off roll. Swiss investigation authority SUST found the A220-300, bound for Geneva, had conducted a de-rated rolling take-off from intersection C of runway 35, with its autothrottle armed. But when the captain advanced the thrust levers, he only pushed them to a lever angle of 20.6°, less than the 23° required to engage the autothrottle. The pilots were distracted by an unexpected discontinuity in the flightplan after entering the standard departure route into the flight-management system, and the captain asked the first officer to keep a close watch on the system during the take-off roll. SUST says this meant the first officer had greater difficulty paying the required attention to the monitoring of take-off procedures. “In this important phase of the flight, this prioritisation was inappropriate,” it states. As the aircraft accelerated to 60kt the spoilers extended, as designed, but this was not indicated to the crew. Neither pilot could remember whether they had carried out the 80kt speed and engine thrust check, it adds: “This cannot be explained by anything other than that the check – if it took place – was not performed with the required level of attention.” Only once the aircraft had reached 90-100kt did the captain realise that the thrust setting was too low, and he advanced the thrust levers to 28.5° – passing the 23° threshold and causing the spoilers to retract. The aircraft issued a configuration warning for the spoilers, noted and checked by the first officer. While the captain briefly considered aborting the take-off, he instead opted to proceed and the A220 lifted off about 1,000m from the end of the runway. SUST says it had travelled 50% more than the calculated take-off distance. SUST also points out that the thrust levers, even with the late advancement, only resulted in an engine speed of 76.6% N1 – still below the calculated take-off power – and this continued until the autothrottle changed mode at 400ft. This indicates that the pilots were “unaware” of the actual thrust set during take-off, says the inquiry, adding that the crew probably ought to have pushed the thrust levers to their mechanical stop given the potential risks associated with extended take-off rolls. None of the 46 occupants was injured during the 15 July 2018 incident. The aircraft involved (HB-JCC) had been delivered to the carrier as a Bombardier CS300 before Airbus's acquisition of the programme.",3,530,7.0,0.4265,"crew, runway, inquiry, land, approach, accident, investigator, captain, incident, pilot","['investigator', 'probe', 'swiss', 'lowthrust', 'incident', 'departure', 'porto', 'found', 'pilot', 'belatedly', 'realise', 'autothrottle', 'engage', 'takeoff', 'roll', 'swiss', 'investigation', 'authority', 'sust', 'found', 'bound', 'geneva', 'conduct', 'derate', 'roll', 'takeoff', 'intersection', 'c', 'runway', 'autothrottle', 'arm', 'captain', 'advanced', 'thrust', 'lever', 'push', 'lever', 'angle', 'less', 'require', 'engage', 'autothrottle', 'pilot', 'distract', 'unexpected', 'discontinuity', 'flightplan', 'enter', 'standard', 'departure', 'route', 'flightmanagement', 'system', 'captain', 'ask', 'officer', 'keep', 'close', 'watch', 'system', 'takeoff', 'roll', 'sust', 'say', 'meant', 'officer', 'great', 'difficulty', 'pay', 'require', 'attention', 'monitoring', 'takeoff', 'procedure', 'important', 'phase', 'prioritisation', 'inappropriate', 'state', 'accelerate', 'spoiler', 'extend', 'design', 'indicate', 'crew', 'neither', 'pilot', 'remember', 'whether', 'carry', 'speed', 'engine', 'thrust', 'check', 'add', 'explain', 'anything', 'check', 'take', 'place', 'perform', 'require', 'level', 'reach', 'captain', 'realise', 'thrust', 'set', 'low', 'advanced', 'thrust', 'lever', 'passing', 'threshold', 'cause', 'spoiler', 'retract', 'issue', 'configuration', 'warn', 'spoiler', 'note', 'checked', 'officer', 'captain', 'briefly', 'consider', 'abort', 'takeoff', 'instead', 'opt', 'proceed', 'lift', 'end', 'runway', 'sust', 'say', 'travel', 'calculate', 'takeoff', 'distance', 'sust', 'point', 'thrust', 'lever', 'even', 'late', 'advancement', 'result', 'engine', 'speed', 'still', 'calculate', 'takeoff', 'power', 'continued', 'autothrottle', 'change', 'mode', 'indicates', 'pilot', 'unaware', 'actual', 'thrust', 'set', 'takeoff', 'say', 'inquiry', 'add', 'crew', 'probably', 'ought', 'push', 'thrust', 'lever', 'mechanical', 'stop', 'give', 'potential', 'risk', 'associate', 'extend', 'takeoff', 'roll', 'none', 'occupant', 'injured', 'july', 'incident', 'involve', 'hbjcc', 'deliver', 'carrier', 'bombardier', 'acquisition', 'programme']"

"Rolls-Royce will release a newly designed third-stage turbine wheel for its M250-C20F turboshaft engine by the end of the year, which will have improved strength and tolerance to fatigue cracking. The modification was disclosed by the Australian Transport Safety Board (ATSB) in its final investigation report into an engine failure aboard an Airbus Helicopters AS355 F1 on 12 March 2018. The right engine of VH-SEV. Investigators determined that cracking in a third-stage turbine blade was the root cause of the failure of light-twin's right-hand powerplant. The ATSB notes in the report that the “rapid...progression” of the cracks was likely caused by a momentary dwell in the speed avoidance range. Operated by aerial cinematography company Rotor Head, the helicopter (VH-SEV) was hover-taxiing with one pilot and one passenger on board from a hangar to the maintenance facility at Bankstown Aerodrome, New South Wales, when the failure occurred. As the skids touched the ground on landing, the pilot reported hearing a loud squeal from the helicopter's right side. He also observed the engine gas generator speed drop to 55%, and the right-hand engine chip light illuminate. He then noticed smoke coming from the right side and shut down the engine immediately. Mechanics from a nearby workshop ran out and extinguished the engine fire. The ATSB notes that the helicopter sustained significant damage to the engine and minor heat damage to the surrounding structure. R-R's failure analysis after the incident notes that 21 of the remaining 34 third-stage turbine blades were found to have crack-like indications on the trailing edge. A fatigue crack in a turbine blade spread rapidly, causing an engine failure in an Airbus Helicopters AS355 F1 The engine maker adds that the “high-cycle fatigue crack progression only occurs when there is steady-state operation of the engine at a responsive wheel mode”. In its analysis of the incident, the ATSB notes that there were sufficient fatigue cracks to require the part to be removed from service “but [were] not detected during the last inspection” which took place less than two months before the failure. “The size and nature of the cracks meant there was a low probability of detection using the specified inspection method,” the ATSB states. Other than a redesign of the turbine disc, R-R has also updated its operations manual to simplify the speed avoidance range, and “more clearly articulate the possible consequence of dwelling”. Since 1999, there have been nine reported in-service failures involving the turboshaft engines, which were previously manufactured by Allison. “In each instance, at least one blade on the third-stage turbine [disc] liberated because of fatigue, resulting in an engine failure. Analysis showed similar crack morphology to that found on the third-stage wheel of VH-SEV,” the ATSB states. Cirium's fleet data indicates VH-SEV is a 35-year-old rotorcraft, and was delivered in June 1984 to Sabah Flying Club.

"Korean Air's president, Woo Kee-hong, has painted a dire picture for the carrier in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak. In an internal memo, he told employees that coronavirus-related travel restrictions led the airline to cut more than 80% of its international capacity, in contrast with 18% during the 1997-98 Asian financial crisis, according to a Reuters report. Woo was quoted as saying: “We can easily imagine the severity of the crisis we are facing in comparison. And what is more daunting is that the situation can get worse at any time and we cannot even predict how long it will last.” He added: “But if the situation continues for a longer period, we may reach the threshold where we cannot guarantee the company's survival.” Korean Air tells Cirium that the memo was meant for employees only but confirms the key points of his address: “We are facing challenges caused by COVID-19, and many of our operations have been disrupted. “However, Korean Air is strong and resilient, and the company will keep the basic principle to minimise sacrifices of our employees.” “We have gone through numerous difficulties for the past 51 years, and I'm confident that we overcome this crisis together.” The airline also confirmed that it has grounded 100 of 145 passenger aircraft in its fleet.

"The United States will ban nearly all travel from Europe to the United States from 13 March, US President Donald Trump says in an address to the nation. “We will be suspending all travel from Europe to the United States for the next 30 days,” Trump says in a nationally televised address from the Oval Office on 11 March. “The new rules will go into effect Friday at midnight. These restrictions will be adjusted subject to conditions on the ground.” Exceptions will be made for Americans who have “undergone appropriate screenings”, he adds without expanding on what such screening might entail. The restrictions do not apply to the United Kingdom, as the presidential proclamation only applies to 26 European states included in the border-free Schengen area. The travel ban is designed to prevent further spread of the coronavirus, which has sickened 118,000 people in more than 110 countries.

"The US Department of Transportation has granted airlines slot relief after carriers and industry group IATA complained it was unfair to maintain those rigid rules as fear of the coronavirus decimates passenger demand across the industry. Authorities in affected geographies had been reluctant to allow airlines to maintain their slots if they did not adhere to the requirement that they use the particular slot 80% of the time. As a result, in the past week, some airlines had been operating empty or near-empty aircraft just to maintain their slot assignments. “The FAA is waiving the 80-percent-use requirement through May 31, 2020 for US and foreign airlines that have affected flights,” the US regulator says on 11 March. “In doing so, the FAA expects that US carriers will be accommodated with reciprocal relief by foreign authorities at airports in their countries, and may determine not to grant a waiver to a foreign carrier whose home jurisdiction does not reciprocate.” The FAA says the waiver will apply to John F Kennedy International airport (JFK), New York LaGuardia airport (LGA), and Ronald Reagan Washington National airport (DCA). Four more airports - Chicago O'Hare International airport (ORD), Newark Liberty International airport (EWR), Los Angeles International airport (LAX), and San Francisco International airport (SFO) – are still in the review and approval process for similar waivers. The regulatory body says it will adjust the conditions as circumstances warrant. The FAA's move comes just a day after the European Commission also agreed to suspend the rules for its jurisdiction for an undetermined period of time. On Tuesday, both United Airlines and American Airlines said they expect to experience significant declines in revenue in the coming months as passengers cancel or delay non-essential travel. The two US carriers say demand will continue to be at or below the level following the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks as travelers attempt to protect themselves from the virus. Earlier on Wednesday, the World Health Organisation declared the coronavirus outbreak a global pandemic, and says it has registered more than 118,000 cases worldwide, most of them in mainland China and Italy.",3,536,5.0,0.2309,"carrier, march, international, outbreak, suspend, capacity, schedule, april, united, coronavirus","['u', 'department', 'transportation', 'grant', 'slot', 'relief', 'carrier', 'industry', 'iata', 'complain', 'unfair', 'maintain', 'rigid', 'rule', 'fear', 'coronavirus', 'decimates', 'passenger', 'demand', 'across', 'industry', 'authority', 'affected', 'geography', 'reluctant', 'allow', 'maintain', 'slot', 'adhere', 'requirement', 'use', 'particular', 'slot', 'result', 'past', 'week', 'operating', 'empty', 'nearempty', 'maintain', 'slot', 'assignment', 'faa', 'waive', 'requirement', 'may', 'u', 'foreign', 'affected', 'u', 'regulator', 'say', 'march', 'faa', 'expect', 'u', 'carrier', 'accommodate', 'reciprocal', 'relief', 'foreign', 'authority', 'airport', 'country', 'may', 'determine', 'grant', 'waiver', 'foreign', 'carrier', 'whose', 'home', 'jurisdiction', 'faa', 'say', 'waiver', 'apply', 'john', 'f', 'kennedy', 'international', 'airport', 'jfk', 'york', 'laguardia', 'airport', 'lga', 'ronald', 'reagan', 'washington', 'national', 'airport', 'dca', 'airport', 'chicago', 'international', 'airport', 'ord', 'newark', 'liberty', 'international', 'airport', 'ewr', 'los', 'angeles', 'international', 'airport', 'lax', 'san', 'francisco', 'international', 'airport', 'sfo', 'still', 'review', 'approval', 'process', 'similar', 'waiver', 'regulatory', 'body', 'say', 'adjust', 'condition', 'circumstance', 'warrant', 'faa', 'move', 'come', 'day', 'european', 'commission', 'agree', 'suspend', 'rule', 'jurisdiction', 'undetermined', 'period', 'tuesday', 'united', 'american', 'say', 'expect', 'experience', 'significant', 'decline', 'revenue', 'come', 'month', 'passenger', 'cancel', 'delay', 'nonessential', 'travel', 'u', 'carrier', 'say', 'demand', 'continue', 'level', 'follow', 'september', 'terrorist', 'attack', 'traveler', 'attempt', 'protect', 'virus', 'earlier', 'wednesday', 'world', 'health', 'organisation', 'declare', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'global', 'pandemic', 'say', 'register', 'case', 'worldwide', 'mainland', 'italy']"
"A teacher at a Los Angeles area high school has sued Delta Air Lines following a fuel dump from a Delta jet experiencing engine trouble after departing Los Angeles International airport in January. The teacher at Pioneer High School claims in the suit she was “involuntarily coated with jet fuel which penetrated her skin, mouth and nose” during the incident on 14 January. “As a result, she experienced an allergic reaction, causing swelling and irritation to her throat and upper respiratory system,” the McNicholas & McNicholas law firm writes in a statement on 11 March. “In addition to the physical damage caused by the Delta pilot's negligence, the plaintiff suffered severe emotional distress from the knowledge and fear that she may now be at risk for long-term health issues – including cancer – as a result of this toxic exposure.” The firm did not quantify the amount of the lawsuit. On 14 January, one of Delta's Boeing 777-200s dumped fuel over a Los Angeles neighborhood as it was returning to the airport after declaring an emergency, slightly injuring children and adults who were outdoors on a school playground. Shortly thereafter, flight DL89, which had been headed for Shanghai, landed without incident back at Los Angeles. The aircraft had 149 people on board. The lawsuit contends the aircraft crew violated policies around releasing fuel safely. The aircraft was only about 2,000ft above the ground when the fuel dump took place. “Delta and its flight crew for Flight 89 had a duty to notify air traffic control of any need or intent to dump jet fuel during a flight, and were aware of or should have been aware that the aircraft was too low to safely dump fuel,” says Matthew McNicholas, a partner at the firm. “This incident brings into question whether this negligence extends into Delta's policies and protocols.” The Federal Aviation Administration opened an investigation into the incident. “There are special fuel-dumping procedures for aircraft operating into and out of any major US airport. These procedures call for fuel to be dumped over designated unpopulated areas, typically at higher altitudes so the fuel atomises and disperses before it reaches the ground,” the regulatory body said at the time. According to FlightAware.com, the aircraft had reached a maximum altitude of 7,800ft before it returned to Los Angeles. Atlanta-based Delta did not respond to requests for comment on the lawsuit.",3,537,7.0,0.1779,"crew, runway, inquiry, land, approach, accident, investigator, captain, incident, pilot","['teacher', 'los', 'angeles', 'area', 'high', 'school', 'sue', 'delta', 'line', 'follow', 'fuel', 'dump', 'delta', 'jet', 'experience', 'engine', 'trouble', 'depart', 'los', 'angeles', 'international', 'airport', 'january', 'teacher', 'pioneer', 'high', 'school', 'claim', 'suit', 'involuntarily', 'coat', 'jet', 'fuel', 'penetrate', 'skin', 'mouth', 'nose', 'incident', 'january', 'result', 'experienced', 'allergic', 'reaction', 'cause', 'swell', 'irritation', 'throat', 'upper', 'respiratory', 'system', 'mcnicholas', 'mcnicholas', 'law', 'firm', 'writes', 'statement', 'march', 'addition', 'physical', 'damage', 'cause', 'delta', 'pilot', 'negligence', 'plaintiff', 'suffer', 'severe', 'emotional', 'distress', 'knowledge', 'fear', 'may', 'risk', 'longterm', 'health', 'issue', 'include', 'cancer', 'result', 'toxic', 'firm', 'quantify', 'amount', 'lawsuit', 'january', 'delta', 'dumped', 'fuel', 'los', 'angeles', 'neighborhood', 'return', 'airport', 'declare', 'emergency', 'slightly', 'injure', 'child', 'adult', 'outdoors', 'school', 'playground', 'shortly', 'thereafter', 'head', 'shanghai', 'land', 'without', 'incident', 'back', 'los', 'angeles', 'people', 'board', 'lawsuit', 'contends', 'crew', 'violate', 'policy', 'around', 'release', 'fuel', 'safely', 'ground', 'fuel', 'dump', 'take', 'place', 'delta', 'crew', 'duty', 'notify', 'traffic', 'control', 'need', 'intent', 'dump', 'jet', 'fuel', 'aware', 'aware', 'low', 'safely', 'dump', 'fuel', 'say', 'matthew', 'mcnicholas', 'partner', 'firm', 'incident', 'brings', 'question', 'whether', 'negligence', 'extends', 'delta', 'policy', 'federal', 'administration', 'open', 'investigation', 'incident', 'special', 'fueldumping', 'procedure', 'operating', 'major', 'u', 'airport', 'procedure', 'call', 'fuel', 'dumped', 'designate', 'unpopulated', 'area', 'typically', 'high', 'altitude', 'fuel', 'atomises', 'disperses', 'reach', 'ground', 'regulatory', 'body', 'say', 'accord', 'reach', 'maximum', 'altitude', 'return', 'los', 'angeles', 'atlantabased', 'delta', 'respond', 'request', 'comment', 'lawsuit']"
"Kuwait's government has disclosed that all flights to and from the emirate will be suspended from 13 March. The suspension over the coronavirus outbreak will remain in effect “until further notice”, the government has declared. Only Kuwaiti citizens and their immediate relatives will be permitted to fly into the Gulf state. Kuwait Airways has yet to respond publicly to the decision – which comes a day after the Kuwaiti civil aviation authority claimed there was no truth in rumours that the airport would be shut. But the flag-carrier had already been implementing blanket cancellations to Bangladesh, the Philippines, India, Sri Lanka, Lebanon and Egypt, and a number of specific flights to other destinations. Budget operator Jazeera Airways says that all its flights will be suspended when the ruling takes effect. Jazeera says it has offered passengers “flexibility” to amend bookings given the uncertainty over the coronavirus situation. Chairman Marwan Boodai says the airline had already “stepped up” its on-board cleaning processes during turnaround in Kuwait, with a new disinfection programme, cabin fumigation, and frequent replacement of air filters. “Our crew have also taken extra precaution and have been equipped with personal protective medical face masks and gloves,” he adds, while the carrier has avoided routing aircraft to “any major [virus] hot-spots”.

"Scottish judicial authorities have referred the case of the Pan Am Boeing 747-100 bombing over Lockerbie to a court of appeal, 19 years after the only conviction for the attack was secured. The bombing on 21 December 1988 resulted in 259 fatalities from the aircraft, operating flight PA103 to New York, plus 11 residents on the ground. Conviction of the Libyan suspect, Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed Al Megrahi, by a special Scottish court in the Netherlands in January 2001 has long been controversial. While Al Megrahi died in 2012, after serving part of a prison sentence, the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission has referred the case to the High Court of Justiciary, allowing his family to instruct an appeal over his conviction. Six points have been considered by the commission as part of its review of the case, and it says it believes a “miscarriage of justice may have occurred” in two of them – although not the other four. Crucially it believes “no reasonable trial court” could have accepted – based on the evidence of a shopkeeper in Malta – that Al Megrahi was the purchaser of clothing which was later determined to have been packed in a suitcase containing the bomb. The commission says the conclusion that Al Megrahi was the purchaser was “integral” to the court's conclusion that he was guilty of the attack. “Notwithstanding that the remaining chapters of evidence pointed to the involvement of operators of the Libyan state in the execution of the crime,” it adds, “a miscarriage of justice may have occurred because no reasonable trial court, relying on the evidence led at trial, could have held the case against [Al Megrahi] was proved beyond reasonable doubt.” Prosecutors should also have disclosed to the defence team a police report that the shopkeeper had been in possession of photographs of Al Megrahi before identification parades, potentially undermining the shopkeeper's identification evidence and weakening the case. The commission considers the prosecution's failure to disclose this information deprived Al Megrahi of a “real chance of an acquittal”. It also believes a failure to disclose details of reward money to be paid to the shopkeeper, under a US government scheme, reinforces its conclusion that Al Megrahi was “denied a fair trial”. Al Megrahi was convicted through circumstantial evidence after a court heard that the suitcase – containing the clothing and a bomb built into a radio-cassette player – was placed on an Air Malta flight from Malta to Frankfurt, transferred to a Pan Am feeder service to London Heathrow, and put on the 747. The court found that Al Megrahi was a senior member of Libyan intelligence, with connections to military procurement, and that he had associations with the partner in a Swiss firm that produced the timing trigger used in the bomb. Al Megrahi had also flown into Malta on 20 December 1988 – the day before the bombing – under a false passport, staying in a hotel under a false name, and was present at Malta's Luqa airport the following day before flying to Libya, the court found. “This is the second time that the commission has carried out what I believe has been a rigorous and independent review of this particular conviction,” says Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission chairman Bill Matthews. “We note that, since our last review, further information has become available, including within the public domain, which the commission has now been able to consider and assess.” Al Megrahi had an initial appeal refused in 2002 and, following a review, the commission referred the case to the High Court in 2007. But Al Megrahi abandoned this appeal in 2009, days before his release from prison, on compassionate grounds, was approved by Scottish ministers. Renewed referral of the case for appeal comes in the same week that another trial has opened in the Netherlands concerning the deliberate destruction of a long-haul airliner, with Dutch prosecutors putting a case – in absentia – against four suspects alleged to have assisted with the shooting-down of a Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777-200ER operating flight MH17 over Ukraine in July 2014.",3,539,10.0,0.6025,"international, authority, civil, state, investigation, case, add, january, airasia, crash","['scottish', 'judicial', 'authority', 'refer', 'case', 'pan', 'bombing', 'lockerbie', 'court', 'appeal', 'conviction', 'attack', 'secure', 'bombing', 'december', 'result', 'fatality', 'operating', 'york', 'plus', 'resident', 'ground', 'conviction', 'libyan', 'suspect', 'abdelbaset', 'ali', 'mohmed', 'al', 'megrahi', 'special', 'scottish', 'court', 'netherlands', 'january', 'long', 'controversial', 'al', 'megrahi', 'die', 'serve', 'part', 'prison', 'sentence', 'scottish', 'criminal', 'case', 'review', 'commission', 'refer', 'case', 'high', 'court', 'justiciary', 'allow', 'family', 'instruct', 'appeal', 'conviction', 'point', 'consider', 'commission', 'part', 'review', 'case', 'say', 'believe', 'miscarriage', 'justice', 'may', 'occur', 'although', 'crucially', 'believe', 'reasonable', 'trial', 'court', 'accepted', 'base', 'evidence', 'shopkeeper', 'malta', 'al', 'megrahi', 'purchaser', 'clothing', 'later', 'determine', 'packed', 'suitcase', 'contain', 'bomb', 'commission', 'say', 'conclusion', 'al', 'megrahi', 'purchaser', 'integral', 'court', 'conclusion', 'guilty', 'attack', 'notwithstanding', 'remain', 'chapter', 'evidence', 'point', 'involvement', 'operator', 'libyan', 'state', 'execution', 'crime', 'add', 'miscarriage', 'justice', 'may', 'occur', 'reasonable', 'trial', 'court', 'rely', 'evidence', 'lead', 'trial', 'held', 'case', 'al', 'megrahi', 'prove', 'beyond', 'reasonable', 'prosecutor', 'disclose', 'defence', 'team', 'police', 'report', 'shopkeeper', 'possession', 'photograph', 'al', 'megrahi', 'identification', 'parade', 'potentially', 'undermine', 'shopkeeper', 'identification', 'evidence', 'weaken', 'case', 'commission', 'considers', 'prosecution', 'failure', 'disclose', 'information', 'deprive', 'al', 'megrahi', 'real', 'chance', 'acquittal', 'believe', 'failure', 'disclose', 'detail', 'reward', 'money', 'paid', 'shopkeeper', 'u', 'government', 'scheme', 'reinforces', 'conclusion', 'al', 'megrahi', 'deny', 'fair', 'trial', 'al', 'megrahi', 'convict', 'circumstantial', 'evidence', 'court', 'heard', 'suitcase', 'contain', 'clothing', 'bomb', 'built', 'radiocassette', 'player', 'place', 'malta', 'malta', 'frankfurt', 'transfer', 'pan', 'feeder', 'service', 'london', 'heathrow', 'put', 'court', 'found', 'al', 'megrahi', 'senior', 'member', 'libyan', 'intelligence', 'connection', 'military', 'procurement', 'association', 'partner', 'swiss', 'firm', 'produce', 'timing', 'trigger', 'use', 'bomb', 'al', 'megrahi', 'flown', 'malta', 'december', 'day', 'bombing', 'false', 'passport', 'stay', 'hotel', 'false', 'name', 'present', 'malta', 'luqa', 'airport', 'follow', 'day', 'fly', 'libya', 'court', 'found', 'second', 'commission', 'carry', 'believe', 'rigorous', 'independent', 'review', 'particular', 'conviction', 'say', 'scottish', 'criminal', 'case', 'review', 'commission', 'chairman', 'bill', 'matthew', 'note', 'since', 'review', 'far', 'information', 'become', 'available', 'include', 'within', 'public', 'domain', 'commission', 'able', 'consider', 'al', 'megrahi', 'initial', 'appeal', 'refuse', 'follow', 'review', 'commission', 'refer', 'case', 'high', 'court', 'al', 'megrahi', 'abandon', 'appeal', 'day', 'release', 'prison', 'compassionate', 'ground', 'approve', 'scottish', 'minister', 'renew', 'referral', 'case', 'appeal', 'come', 'week', 'another', 'trial', 'open', 'netherlands', 'concern', 'deliberate', 'destruction', 'longhaul', 'airliner', 'dutch', 'prosecutor', 'put', 'case', 'absentia', 'suspect', 'allege', 'assist', 'shootingdown', 'malaysia', 'operating', 'ukraine', 'july']"
"Air Canada says it has cancelled orders for 11 Boeing 737 Max aircraft as it reassess its needs in the wake of the troubled aircraft's year-long grounding. The Montreal-based airline currently has 24 737 Max aircraft in its fleet. After the cancellations, it still has orders for 26 737 Max, plus options for 18 aircraft and rights to purchase an additional 30.  The global grounding of the Max, which was ordered a year ago this week following two fatal crashes that killed 346 people, had forced operators of the new-generation single-aisle jets to scramble to find alternative aircraft and cancel or delay thousands of flights. “This decision reflects our evolving, long-term fleet planning requirements,” the airline says. “Aircraft purchases are long-term commitments based on future projections. We placed our original order for the Boeing 737 Max in 2013 with final delivery originally expected in 2021. Since that time, our requirements have evolved, so we are making adjustments to our order to better meet our anticipated needs.” At the end of 2019, Canada's flag carrier had planned to have 36 Max flying, which would have amounted to just under one-quarter of its entire fleet. By the 2020 peak summer travel season, the company had planned on operating 50 of the aircraft type. Air Canada says it is still “fully committed” to the aircraft. “We are actively preparing to return this aircraft to service following regulatory and other safety approvals,” the airline adds. Boeing suspended production of the aircraft in January, and most airlines have taken the type out of their schedules through the second quarter of the year, which includes the beginning of summer travel season.

"The parent company ofIndonesia AirAsia(IAA) has issued a profit warning for the current quarter, attributing it to new lease accounting standards and projected declines in ticket sales due to the coronavirus outbreak. In an Indonesia Stock Exchange disclosure,AirAsiaIndonesia discloses that implementing the new standard will result in a 7% increase in interest expense on lease liabilities and depreciation on right-of-use assets, as well as raise the company's debt ratio.  As a result, the company plans to seek a waiver on the debt ratio restrictions imposed by creditors but stressed that this will not impact its financial position or ongoing obligations. Meanwhile, the company notes that the coronavirus outbreak has led to a decline in projected ticket sales, with load factors on flights operated by IAA now 13% lower than its “average optimum level”. However, it did not quantify the decline or specify the monthly load factors of IAA-operated flights. Based on an investor presentation byAirAsia Groupdiscussing its 2019 financial results,Indonesia AirAsiasaw passenger numbers rise 52% to 7.97 million while seat load factor gained two points to 84% during the year. The Indonesian airline posted Rp1.12 trillion ($77.8 million) in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) in 2019, more than double the Rp497 billion figure in 2018.

"Mitsubishi Aircraft is planning for a low-key first flight of the SpaceJet M90 Flight Test Vehicle 10 (FTV10), owing to government policy to prevent the spread of coronavirus. The company adds that the aircraft is “in final preparations for its first flight, which we will announce in the coming weeks.” Due to Coronavirus prevention measures, however, no event or media activity will accompany the event. The coronavirus outbreak, which originated in China, has had a major impact on air traffic and business activity in the Asia-Pacific, including Japan. According the broadcaster NHK, Japan has 1,278 infections. The M90 was rolled out by MHI Manufacturing in January and handed over to the Mitsubishi Aircraft Flight Test Division. It has been undergoing ground tests including refuelling, engine start, ramping up to full power, and taxiing tests. FTV10 is the first example of the SpaceJet M90 (formerly the MRJ90) produced in what the company calls its “new, certifiable baseline design.” “After the aircraft completes the first flight, we will finalise plans for it to join the flight test fleet in Moses Lake and begin the final stages of Type Certification flight test for the SpaceJet M90,” says the company. Shortly before the Singapore Airshow, MHI announced a fresh delay to the programme, which has suffered several delays over the years. M90 deliveries now expected for between April 2021 and March 2022, or later. In addition to the M90, the company is developing the 65-88 seat M100, which is slated for delivery in 2024, and which is pitched as a competitor to the Embraer E175.

"Malindo Air will begin transferring 15 Boeing 737s to its Lion Air Group sister carrier Batik Air this month, as part of measures taken to overcome challenges from the coronavirus outbreak. In a 6 March internal memo to employees seen by Cirium, Malindo's chief executive Mushafiz Bakri says that in addition to the fleet transfer, the carrier has suspended several services, as well as requesting a delay on payment to airport operators, ground handling companies, and suppliers. It is also urging employees to volunteer for unpaid leave, while its senior management will take a pay cut of up to 40%.  He points out that demand for air travel “has almost collapsed,” and that potential business and leisure passengers have delayed their travel plans “not just out of the fear of contracting the virus,” but also due to the travel restrictions imposed by the various authorities. “Given this situation, all airlines including us are facing severe revenue shortfalls to support existing operations, coupled with the huge fixed costs we have to meet,” says Mushafiz. The memo did not specify whether the 737s being transferred to Batik will only be the -800s or a combination of the -800s and -900ERs. In response to a request from Cirium for more details, Malindo would only say that the fleet transfer begins this month and that the flight suspensions are on routes to China. Malaysia-based Malindo will lose half of its jet-powered fleet when it transfers the 15 737s to Indonesia-based Batik. Cirium fleets data shows that Malindo has 24 737-800s and six -900ERs in service. It also has 12 ATR 72-600s in service, with one now in storage. The fleet transfer will also lead to Batik Air's fleet growing from 58 to at least 73 aircraft. Batik's fleet comprises 44 Airbus A320ceos and one A320neo, an A330-300, and 12 737-800s and -900ERs.

"The ongoing coronavirus outbreak is taking its toll on the Cathay Pacific group's financial performance, with the group warning that it expects to incur a “substantial loss” for the first-half of this year. Cathay adds in its full-year financial results that the outbreak, which first originated in China late 2019, will “adversely impact” its liquidity position.  The carrier will continue to impose “substantial passenger capacity and frequency reduction” through May, as the outbreak wears on. This is on top of the 30% reduction in ASKs for February, and massive 65% cut for March and April. As of end February, passenger load factor has shrunk to about 50%, with year-on-year yield also seeing significant decreases. “It is difficult to predict when these conditions will improve,” says Cathay chairman Patrick Healy. Cathay has been hard hit by the coronavirus outbreak, suspending a significant number of flights due to falling demand and related travel restrictions into the territory. It has also urged its staff to take unpaid leave, and has parked several aircraft. In discussing the outlook for 2020, Healy notes that the carrier has suffered two major blows going into the new year. “Following the impact of social unrest in Hong Kong in the latter half of 2019, the first half of 2020 was expected to be extremely challenging financially, with an already-reduced winter season capacity. This has been exacerbated by the negative impact of COVID-19,” says Healy. In its full-year results, Cathay saw operating profit dip 4.3% to HK$3.4 billion ($437 million), following a worse-than-expected second-half result that was affected by political unrest in the territory.",3,546,3.0,0.3741,"passenger, loss, operating, revenue, traffic, month, increase, capacity, decline, result","['ongoing', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'take', 'toll', 'cathay', 'pacific', 'financial', 'performance', 'warn', 'expect', 'incur', 'substantial', 'loss', 'firsthalf', 'cathay', 'add', 'fullyear', 'financial', 'result', 'outbreak', 'originate', 'late', 'adversely', 'impact', 'liquidity', 'position', 'carrier', 'continue', 'impose', 'substantial', 'passenger', 'capacity', 'frequency', 'reduction', 'may', 'outbreak', 'wear', 'top', 'reduction', 'asks', 'february', 'massive', 'cut', 'march', 'april', 'end', 'february', 'passenger', 'load', 'factor', 'shrunk', 'yearonyear', 'yield', 'see', 'significant', 'decrease', 'difficult', 'predict', 'condition', 'improve', 'say', 'cathay', 'chairman', 'patrick', 'healy', 'cathay', 'hard', 'hit', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'suspend', 'significant', 'number', 'due', 'fall', 'demand', 'related', 'travel', 'restriction', 'territory', 'urge', 'staff', 'take', 'unpaid', 'leave', 'park', 'several', 'discuss', 'outlook', 'healy', 'note', 'carrier', 'suffer', 'major', 'blow', 'go', 'follow', 'impact', 'social', 'unrest', 'hong', 'kong', 'latter', 'half', 'half', 'expect', 'extremely', 'challenge', 'financially', 'alreadyreduced', 'winter', 'season', 'capacity', 'exacerbate', 'negative', 'impact', 'coronavirus', 'say', 'healy', 'fullyear', 'result', 'cathay', 'saw', 'operating', 'profit', 'dip', 'hk', 'follow', 'worsethanexpected', 'secondhalf', 'result', 'affected', 'political', 'unrest', 'territory']"
"The Cathay Pacific Group saw operating profit for 2019 shrink, following a worse-than-expected second-half result that was affected by political turmoil in Hong Kong. For the year ended 31 December 2019, the group reported an operating profit of HK$3.4 billion ($437 million), a 4.3% decrease compared to 2018. Revenue for the year fell 3.7% to HK$107 billion, led by slumps in its cargo business. Meanwhile, expenses dipped 3.6% to HK$104 billion. Attributable net profit for the period came in at HK$1.69 billion, a drop of 27.9% year-on-year. During the year, Cathay Pacific and Cathay Dragon saw ASKs grow 5.1%, while RPKs climbed 2.9%. Passenger load factor slipped 1.8 points consequently. Passenger yield, which Cathay says came “under intense pressure” during the year, fell 3.9%. This was due mainly to a stronger US dollar, intense competition, and reduced demand in the second-half of 2019. The two carriers also carried 0.7% fewer passengers in 2019 compared to a year earlier. Calling 2019 a “turbulent year”, Cathay group chairman Patrick Healy notes that while its three-year transformation programme – which swung the group back into the black for 2018 – bore fruit in the first half of last year, events in the second half of the year led to an “incredibly challenging” operating environment. Since June last year, Hong Kong saw growing political unrest over a now-shelved extradition bill. Protests hit fever-pitch in August, when, among other things, protestors stormed Hong Kong airport, halting operations on two occasions. That, coupled with mounting US-China trade tensions, led to a sharp drop in demand for both inbound and outbound passenger traffic. Cathay has had to trim capacity for most of the second-half of the year. Cathay has traditionally seen stronger results in the second-half of the year, Healy notes, but for 2019, it “fell well below what we would have hoped for”. During the year, Cathay took delivery of six new Airbus A350 aircraft and three used Boeing 777-300 aircraft. It retired three 777-200 aircraft, and returned four A330-300s and one 777-300ER to their respective lessors. The group, which also comprises newly-acquired low-cost subsidiary HK Express and cargo carrier Air Hong Kong, ended the year with 236 aircraft. It is also aiming to take delivery of 70 new aircraft by 2024. The coronavirus outbreak, which began spreading in January this year, will take a toll on its 2020 results, Cathay adds. “We expect our passenger business to be under severe pressure this year and that our cargo business will continue to face headwinds,” says Healy.",3,547,3.0,0.4005,"passenger, loss, operating, revenue, traffic, month, increase, capacity, decline, result","['cathay', 'pacific', 'saw', 'operating', 'profit', 'shrink', 'follow', 'worsethanexpected', 'secondhalf', 'result', 'affected', 'political', 'turmoil', 'hong', 'kong', 'end', 'december', 'report', 'operating', 'profit', 'hk', 'decrease', 'compare', 'revenue', 'fell', 'hk', 'lead', 'slump', 'cargo', 'business', 'meanwhile', 'expense', 'dipped', 'hk', 'attributable', 'net', 'profit', 'period', 'come', 'hk', 'drop', 'yearonyear', 'cathay', 'pacific', 'cathay', 'dragon', 'saw', 'asks', 'grow', 'rpks', 'climbed', 'passenger', 'load', 'factor', 'slip', 'point', 'consequently', 'passenger', 'yield', 'cathay', 'say', 'come', 'intense', 'pressure', 'fell', 'due', 'mainly', 'strong', 'u', 'dollar', 'intense', 'competition', 'reduce', 'demand', 'secondhalf', 'carrier', 'carry', 'passenger', 'compare', 'earlier', 'call', 'turbulent', 'cathay', 'chairman', 'patrick', 'healy', 'note', 'threeyear', 'transformation', 'programme', 'swung', 'back', 'black', 'bore', 'fruit', 'half', 'event', 'second', 'half', 'lead', 'incredibly', 'challenge', 'operating', 'environment', 'since', 'june', 'hong', 'kong', 'saw', 'grow', 'political', 'unrest', 'nowshelved', 'extradition', 'bill', 'protest', 'hit', 'feverpitch', 'august', 'among', 'thing', 'protestors', 'storm', 'hong', 'kong', 'airport', 'halt', 'operation', 'occasion', 'couple', 'mount', 'uschina', 'trade', 'tension', 'lead', 'sharp', 'drop', 'demand', 'inbound', 'outbound', 'passenger', 'traffic', 'cathay', 'trim', 'capacity', 'secondhalf', 'cathay', 'traditionally', 'see', 'strong', 'result', 'secondhalf', 'healy', 'note', 'fell', 'well', 'hop', 'cathay', 'take', 'delivery', 'use', 'retire', 'return', 'respective', 'lessor', 'comprises', 'newlyacquired', 'lowcost', 'subsidiary', 'hk', 'express', 'cargo', 'carrier', 'hong', 'kong', 'end', 'aim', 'take', 'delivery', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'begin', 'spread', 'january', 'take', 'toll', 'result', 'cathay', 'add', 'expect', 'passenger', 'business', 'severe', 'pressure', 'cargo', 'business', 'continue', 'face', 'headwind', 'say', 'healy']"
"Virgin Groupfounder Richard Branson says that the airline industry has endured past crises but could “come to a grinding halt fairly quickly” amid coronavirus outbreak risks. The founder of numerous companies including air launch to orbit service Virgin Orbit andVirgin Atlantic Airwaysaccepted an award from the Royal Aeronautical Society in Washington, DC, which Branson said was “interesting” timing because that same day stocks plummeted amid virus concerns. “I would beg people not to stop flying because the airline industry could come to a grinding halt fairly quickly if people are not brave enough to get on planes,” he said 9 March at the event. The US government has advised elderly passengers to reconsider attending large events or traveling on aircraft because that age group is most vulnerable to coronavirus. Branson advised people to “wash your hands, do the [fist] bump” and take other precautions rather than giving up on air travel. Since foundingVirgin Atlantic Airwaysand Virgin Cargo in 1984, Branson said his companies survived lack of demand following financial crises and the 11 September terrorist attacks, and “I'm sure we are going to survive this”. Travel related stocks have been hit particularly hard in recent days as governments seek to mitigate the spread of infection. The sharp decline in travel demand is rough for Branson, who said during his speech “Virgin's main businesses today are airlines, holiday companies, hotels, health clubs, cruise ships”, leading the entrepreneur to joke “I wish I had diversified less!” “All of our industries are in the front line of this virus,” Branson said of his portfolio of companies. To encourage people to book flights,Virgin Atlanticlast week announced it will not charge fees to change bookings made prior to 4th March 2020 for travel during March. Tickets for Virgin's international network and codeshare flights issued between 4 March and 31 March can be changed for travel until 30 September 2020. Numerous companies includingAmerican Airlines,United AirlinesandAlaska Airlineshave made similar flexible booking offers as travel options shift amid the coronavirus outbreak. Italy is the latest country to face travel restrictions as its government tries to contain the spread of infection. Global lack of travel demand dealt the final blow to financially-troubled UK regional operatorFlybe, which on 5 March ceased operations and entered administration. As one of the three investors in theConnect Airways- the consortium formed to take overFlybea little more than a year ago -Virgin Atlantichad intended to develop the airline as a feeder for long-haul services under the Virgin Connect brand. The negative impact of coronavirus on air travel, however, led the group to pull funding fromFlybeleading to its demise earlier this month. Coronavirus is also adding to the financial problems ofVirgin Australia, which Standard & Poor's has downgraded from stable to negative amid lack of demand for flights to China and other countries in Asia. The airline seeks to cut expenses by removing 400 jobs by the end of March and another 350 by June, along with reconsidering agreements with suppliers and cutting its capacity during the second half of 2020. “The coronavirus outbreak is having a significant effect on the travel industry and we are also seeing weaker domestic and international demand,”Virgin Australiachief executive Paul Scurrah said in a statement on 25 February.",3,548,12.0,0.1911,"travel, government, country, coronavirus, measure, restriction, passenger, state, march, canada","['virgin', 'groupfounder', 'richard', 'branson', 'say', 'industry', 'endure', 'past', 'crisis', 'come', 'grind', 'halt', 'fairly', 'quickly', 'amid', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'risk', 'founder', 'numerous', 'include', 'launch', 'orbit', 'service', 'virgin', 'orbit', 'andvirgin', 'atlantic', 'airwaysaccepted', 'award', 'royal', 'aeronautical', 'society', 'washington', 'dc', 'branson', 'say', 'interest', 'timing', 'day', 'stock', 'plummet', 'amid', 'virus', 'concern', 'beg', 'people', 'stop', 'fly', 'industry', 'come', 'grind', 'halt', 'fairly', 'quickly', 'people', 'brave', 'enough', 'get', 'plane', 'say', 'march', 'event', 'u', 'government', 'advise', 'elderly', 'passenger', 'reconsider', 'attend', 'large', 'event', 'travel', 'age', 'vulnerable', 'coronavirus', 'branson', 'advise', 'people', 'wash', 'hand', 'fist', 'bump', 'take', 'precaution', 'rather', 'give', 'travel', 'since', 'foundingvirgin', 'atlantic', 'airwaysand', 'virgin', 'cargo', 'branson', 'say', 'survive', 'lack', 'demand', 'follow', 'financial', 'crisis', 'september', 'terrorist', 'attack', 'sure', 'go', 'survive', 'travel', 'related', 'stock', 'hit', 'particularly', 'hard', 'recent', 'day', 'government', 'seek', 'mitigate', 'spread', 'infection', 'sharp', 'decline', 'travel', 'demand', 'rough', 'branson', 'say', 'speech', 'virgin', 'main', 'business', 'today', 'holiday', 'hotel', 'health', 'club', 'cruise', 'ship', 'lead', 'entrepreneur', 'joke', 'wish', 'diversified', 'less', 'industry', 'front', 'line', 'virus', 'branson', 'say', 'portfolio', 'encourage', 'people', 'book', 'virgin', 'atlanticlast', 'week', 'announce', 'charge', 'fee', 'change', 'booking', 'make', 'prior', 'march', 'travel', 'march', 'ticket', 'virgin', 'international', 'network', 'codeshare', 'issue', 'march', 'march', 'change', 'travel', 'september', 'numerous', 'includingamerican', 'united', 'airlinesandalaska', 'airlineshave', 'make', 'similar', 'flexible', 'book', 'offer', 'travel', 'option', 'shift', 'amid', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'italy', 'late', 'country', 'face', 'travel', 'restriction', 'government', 'try', 'contain', 'spread', 'infection', 'global', 'lack', 'travel', 'demand', 'dealt', 'final', 'blow', 'financiallytroubled', 'uk', 'regional', 'operatorflybe', 'march', 'cease', 'operation', 'enter', 'administration', 'investor', 'theconnect', 'airway', 'consortium', 'form', 'take', 'overflybea', 'little', 'ago', 'virgin', 'atlantichad', 'intend', 'develop', 'feeder', 'longhaul', 'service', 'virgin', 'connect', 'brand', 'negative', 'impact', 'coronavirus', 'travel', 'however', 'lead', 'pull', 'funding', 'fromflybeleading', 'demise', 'earlier', 'month', 'coronavirus', 'add', 'financial', 'problem', 'ofvirgin', 'australia', 'standard', 'poor', 'downgrade', 'stable', 'negative', 'amid', 'lack', 'demand', 'country', 'asia', 'seek', 'cut', 'expense', 'remove', 'job', 'end', 'march', 'another', 'june', 'along', 'reconsider', 'agreement', 'supplier', 'cut', 'capacity', 'second', 'half', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'significant', 'effect', 'travel', 'industry', 'see', 'weaker', 'domestic', 'international', 'demand', 'virgin', 'australiachief', 'executive', 'paul', 'scurrah', 'say', 'statement', 'february']"
"Malaysia Airlinesis scaling down first-quarter capacity 7.1% amid the coronavirus outbreak, as it halves Chinese operations and makes a double-digit cut to North Asian services. Addressing employees in a video seen by Cirium, Izham Ismail – chief executive of the airline's parent Malaysia Aviation Group – describes the 7.1% reduction as “huge”. He notes the cancellation of “more than 1,600 flights” to date and says he expects the number to rise if the outbreak continues to affect demand for air travel. “Malaysia Aviation Group is not spared from all of this,” says Izham. “Drastic action from all of us needs to be taken. For a start, the senior management team will take a 10% salary cut, including the allowances.” Before facing the challenges posed by the coronavirus crisis, the group had managed to improve its performance in 2019. Revenue climbed 7%, and net income rose despite higher fuel costs, foreign-exchange movements, and the adoption of a new accounting standard on leases. Initiatives to raise revenue included introduction of a new family fare, upselling of its business-class offering, and promotion of new ancillary products. Although a passenger-revenue target was missed by 3%, on a per-unit basis it was up 3%, as capacity was increased 5%. Yield likewise rose 5%. However, Izham did not provide a figure for the operating result. After it achieved 65% of a savings target last year, he stresses the need for better cost control on a group level. “What we need to do better is in further breaking costs down. Although we're already competitive compared to our peer airlines, there is still a large room for improvement, especially in reducing our wastage,” says Izham.",3,549,3.0,0.239,"passenger, loss, operating, revenue, traffic, month, increase, capacity, decline, result","['malaysia', 'airlinesis', 'scale', 'firstquarter', 'capacity', 'amid', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'half', 'chinese', 'operation', 'make', 'doubledigit', 'cut', 'north', 'asian', 'service', 'address', 'employee', 'video', 'see', 'izham', 'ismail', 'chief', 'executive', 'parent', 'malaysia', 'describes', 'reduction', 'huge', 'note', 'cancellation', 'date', 'say', 'expect', 'number', 'rise', 'outbreak', 'continue', 'affect', 'demand', 'travel', 'malaysia', 'spar', 'say', 'izham', 'drastic', 'action', 'u', 'need', 'take', 'start', 'senior', 'management', 'team', 'take', 'salary', 'cut', 'include', 'face', 'challenge', 'pose', 'coronavirus', 'crisis', 'manage', 'improve', 'performance', 'revenue', 'climbed', 'net', 'income', 'rise', 'despite', 'high', 'fuel', 'cost', 'foreignexchange', 'movement', 'adoption', 'accounting', 'standard', 'lease', 'initiative', 'raise', 'revenue', 'include', 'introduction', 'family', 'fare', 'upselling', 'businessclass', 'offering', 'promotion', 'ancillary', 'product', 'although', 'passengerrevenue', 'target', 'miss', 'perunit', 'basis', 'capacity', 'increase', 'yield', 'likewise', 'rise', 'however', 'izham', 'provide', 'figure', 'operating', 'result', 'achieve', 'saving', 'target', 'stress', 'need', 'well', 'cost', 'control', 'level', 'need', 'well', 'far', 'break', 'cost', 'although', 'already', 'competitive', 'compare', 'peer', 'still', 'large', 'room', 'improvement', 'especially', 'reduce', 'wastage', 'say', 'izham']"
"American Airlines has extended the suspension and cancellation of numerous international flights, including to regions that have not yet been severely impacted by the coronavirus, such as Latin America. The Fort-Worth-based airline says on 10 March that it is cutting summer international capacity by about 10% and April domestic capacity by 7.5% in response to decreasing demand. The airline, which reduced service to several destinations in Asia several weeks ago as the crisis began to develop, has now announced its routes from the USA to Montevideo, Uruguay and Santiago, Chile will also be stopped. As of Tuesday, Chile reported 13 cases of coronavirus to the World Health Organisation (WHO), and Uruguay has none. American will also suspend many of its flights between the USA and Rome and Milan. Italy has effectively declared a lockdown for the entire country after the number of cases in the southern European country exploded to almost 10,000 and deaths from the virus rose to 463, according to the WHO. In addition, non-Italy European destinations Paris and Madrid will also see a reduction in service for parts of May and June. It is also delaying the seasonal resumption of flights from the US to Barcelona and Venice. The airline says that its widebody aircraft will be redeployed on domestic routes. American says it will also introduce new seasonal service between Chicago and Honolulu this summer on a Boeing 787. The carrier says that these schedule adjustments assume that it will not be receiving relief from slot requirements. So far, certain cities and regions have been reluctant to allow airlines to maintain their slots if they are not using them 80% of the time. “American has requested temporary relief from this usage requirement – otherwise known as requesting a slot waiver – to better align capacity with demand without the risk of losing valuable takeoff and landing slots for the future,” the airline says on its website. “American will continue to review its network and make adjustments as needed if waivers are granted.” American's Atlanta-based rival Delta Air Lines, said earlier on Tuesday that its net bookings have recently tumbled by 25-30%, prompting excess capacity of 15%. To match falling demand, Delta will reduce domestic capacity by 10-15% and slash international capacity by 20-25%. United Airlines' president Scott Kirby told an analyst conference earlier in the day that it is planning for an up to 70% decline in revenue for the next two months, with further reductions for the rest of the year.

"UK regulators are warning that European airlines might not be completely exempt from passenger compensation payments relating to the coronavirus outbreak, although much of the disruption is likely to fall under 'extraordinary circumstance' immunity. The Civil Aviation Authority has outlined its interpretation of European Union compensation rules in light of the outbreak. It says the EU passenger rights legislation is “applicable at all times” including the “unprecedented” coronavirus situation. But it acknowledges that – in the event of flight cancellations – airlines could face “significant practical difficulties” in providing alternative flights, and refunds could be the only realistic measure available. While fixed-sum compensation might ordinarily apply to flight cancellations, the CAA believes coronavirus containment measures – such as government advisories against travel, or regulatory activity which restricts airline operations – would be viewed as extraordinary circumstances, exempting carriers from such compensation obligations. Airlines might choose to cancel flights at short notice to avoid costly operation of services with only a small number of passengers on board. “Such [situations] may be viewed as 'extraordinary circumstances' under [the EU regulation] and therefore the fixed-sum compensation would not be payable,” the CAA states, but cautions: “This may not be the case in all circumstances.” Although the CAA says it is “cognisant” of the current difficult operating conditions for airlines, and believes it should act proportionately and concentrate on harmful “systematic” issues, it nevertheless expects carriers to act in the interests of their passengers. “On this basis, we will look to airlines to demonstrate that they are being pro-active and flexible in managing the situation and minimising the impact on passengers of the disruption,” it says. It adds that its interpretation of 'extraordinary circumstances' is only a guide and each individual case will have its own specific facts to consider. Passengers will be able to seek legal redress if they disagree with the regulator's view.",3,551,2.0,0.1577,"executive, chief, cut, add, situation, staff, crisis, make, coronavirus, employee","['uk', 'regulator', 'warn', 'european', 'might', 'completely', 'exempt', 'passenger', 'compensation', 'payment', 'relate', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'although', 'much', 'disruption', 'likely', 'fall', 'circumstance', 'immunity', 'civil', 'authority', 'outline', 'interpretation', 'european', 'union', 'compensation', 'rule', 'light', 'outbreak', 'say', 'eu', 'passenger', 'right', 'legislation', 'applicable', 'include', 'unprecedented', 'coronavirus', 'situation', 'acknowledges', 'event', 'cancellation', 'face', 'significant', 'practical', 'difficulty', 'provide', 'alternative', 'refund', 'realistic', 'measure', 'available', 'fixedsum', 'compensation', 'might', 'ordinarily', 'apply', 'cancellation', 'caa', 'believe', 'coronavirus', 'containment', 'measure', 'government', 'advisory', 'travel', 'regulatory', 'activity', 'restricts', 'operation', 'view', 'extraordinary', 'circumstance', 'exempt', 'carrier', 'compensation', 'obligation', 'might', 'choose', 'cancel', 'short', 'notice', 'avoid', 'costly', 'operation', 'service', 'small', 'number', 'passenger', 'board', 'situation', 'may', 'view', 'circumstance', 'eu', 'regulation', 'therefore', 'fixedsum', 'compensation', 'payable', 'caa', 'state', 'caution', 'may', 'case', 'although', 'caa', 'say', 'cognisant', 'current', 'difficult', 'operating', 'condition', 'believe', 'act', 'proportionately', 'concentrate', 'harmful', 'systematic', 'issue', 'nevertheless', 'expect', 'carrier', 'act', 'interest', 'passenger', 'basis', 'look', 'demonstrate', 'proactive', 'flexible', 'manage', 'situation', 'minimise', 'impact', 'passenger', 'disruption', 'say', 'add', 'interpretation', 'circumstance', 'guide', 'individual', 'case', 'specific', 'fact', 'consider', 'passenger', 'able', 'seek', 'legal', 'redress', 'disagree', 'regulator', 'view']"
"Lufthansa has sharply criticised the planned acquisition of German leisure airline Condor by Polska Grupa Lotnicza, the parent of Polish flag carrier LOT, labelling it an example of “dubious” state intervention that “distorts competition”. In January, PGL disclosed that it would become Condor's sole shareholder and intended to build up the Frankfurt-based airline as LOT's leisure-focused leisure sister carrier. Government-owned PGL acknowledged that Condor's acquisition was being financed by the Polish state. Lufthansa describes LOTas one of several European airlines that “no longer have a sustainable business model [and] have been kept flying by governments. “Poland has helped its state airline back on its feet several times,” the German airline group asserts. Lufthansa says a “one-off crisis intervention” by a government to rescue an airline from collapse “makes sense”. The group sees “substantial reasons for politicians to come to the rescue of companies in certain situations”, but warns: “It becomes problematic when state interventions become the rule.” Condor was kept alive by a six-month, €380 million ($428 million) bridging loan facilitated by the German government following the collapse of the carrier's former parent Thomas Cookin 2019. Lufthansa describes the Polish state's role as providing “permanent survival assistance” for LOT, which “not only distorts competition, but also harms the climate”. Alitaliais also cited by Lufthansa as an operator that “can carry on flying without the pressure of profitability to which other airlines are subject”. The Italian flag carrier has been placed in administration by the country's government and received several financial support packages to continue operations. In Lufthansa's view, such support “prevents the consolidation of the industry that is so necessary in Europe”. The German group laments that while air travel has come under increased pressure over its environmental impact, “state money is being used to fuel the price war in the skies and low-cost flights are being indirectly supported”.",3,552,8.0,0.3458,"government, uk, carrier, business, state, share, south, airway, financial, plan","['lufthansa', 'sharply', 'criticise', 'plan', 'acquisition', 'german', 'leisure', 'condor', 'polska', 'grupa', 'lotnicza', 'parent', 'polish', 'flag', 'carrier', 'lot', 'label', 'example', 'dubious', 'state', 'intervention', 'distorts', 'competition', 'january', 'pgl', 'disclose', 'become', 'condor', 'sole', 'shareholder', 'intend', 'build', 'frankfurtbased', 'lot', 'leisurefocused', 'leisure', 'sister', 'carrier', 'governmentowned', 'pgl', 'acknowledge', 'condor', 'acquisition', 'finance', 'polish', 'state', 'lufthansa', 'describes', 'lota', 'several', 'european', 'longer', 'sustainable', 'business', 'model', 'kept', 'fly', 'government', 'poland', 'help', 'state', 'back', 'foot', 'several', 'german', 'asserts', 'lufthansa', 'say', 'oneoff', 'crisis', 'intervention', 'government', 'rescue', 'collapse', 'make', 'sense', 'see', 'substantial', 'reason', 'politician', 'come', 'rescue', 'certain', 'situation', 'warns', 'becomes', 'problematic', 'state', 'intervention', 'become', 'condor', 'kept', 'alive', 'sixmonth', 'bridging', 'loan', 'facilitate', 'german', 'government', 'follow', 'collapse', 'carrier', 'former', 'parent', 'thomas', 'cookin', 'lufthansa', 'describes', 'polish', 'state', 'role', 'provide', 'permanent', 'survival', 'assistance', 'lot', 'distorts', 'competition', 'harm', 'climate', 'alitaliais', 'cite', 'lufthansa', 'operator', 'carry', 'fly', 'without', 'pressure', 'profitability', 'subject', 'italian', 'flag', 'carrier', 'place', 'administration', 'country', 'government', 'receive', 'several', 'financial', 'support', 'package', 'continue', 'operation', 'lufthansa', 'view', 'support', 'prevents', 'consolidation', 'industry', 'necessary', 'europe', 'german', 'lament', 'travel', 'come', 'increase', 'pressure', 'environmental', 'impact', 'state', 'money', 'use', 'fuel', 'price', 'war', 'sky', 'lowcost', 'indirectly', 'support']"
"European regulators are set to release airlines from slot-use obligations to ease pressure on carriers as they cut capacity to cope with coronavirus outbreak effects. The European Commission says it will put forward “targeted legislation” which will “temporarily alleviate” airlines from the need to follow slot usage rules. Transport commissioner Adina Valean says the measures will allow airlines to adjust capacity to match demand. “Given the urgency, the Commission will, in due course, present a legislative proposal and calls on the European Parliament and the Council to swiftly adopt this measure in co-decision procedure,” she adds. Under the current slot regulations airlines must use any allocated slot at least 80% of the time or face having to surrender it. But with the coronavirus outbreak cutting into demand, putting pressure on carriers to cut capacity, airlines are having to operate uneconomical flights simply to avoid giving up valuable slots. The Commission says the situation for the European airline industry is “deteriorating on a daily basis”, adding that the slot measure will help both the industry and the environment. “It releases pressure on the whole aviation industry and, in particular, on smaller airlines,” it says. “It also decreases emissions by avoiding so-called 'ghost flights' where airlines fly almost empty aircraft to keep their slots.”",3,553,9.0,0.1899,"industry, crisis, demand, coronavirus, global, iata, market, level, cargo, expect","['european', 'regulator', 'set', 'release', 'slotuse', 'obligation', 'ease', 'pressure', 'carrier', 'cut', 'capacity', 'cope', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'effect', 'european', 'commission', 'say', 'put', 'forward', 'target', 'legislation', 'temporarily', 'alleviate', 'need', 'follow', 'slot', 'usage', 'rule', 'transport', 'commissioner', 'adina', 'valean', 'say', 'measure', 'allow', 'adjust', 'capacity', 'match', 'demand', 'give', 'urgency', 'commission', 'due', 'course', 'present', 'legislative', 'proposal', 'call', 'european', 'parliament', 'council', 'swiftly', 'adopt', 'measure', 'codecision', 'procedure', 'add', 'current', 'slot', 'regulation', 'must', 'use', 'allocate', 'slot', 'least', 'face', 'surrender', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'cut', 'demand', 'put', 'pressure', 'carrier', 'cut', 'capacity', 'operate', 'uneconomical', 'simply', 'avoid', 'give', 'valuable', 'slot', 'commission', 'say', 'situation', 'european', 'industry', 'deteriorate', 'daily', 'basis', 'add', 'slot', 'measure', 'help', 'industry', 'environment', 'release', 'pressure', 'whole', 'industry', 'particular', 'small', 'say', 'decrease', 'emission', 'avoid', 'socalled', 'fly', 'almost', 'empty', 'keep', 'slot']"
"Alaska Airlines doesn't plan to cut capacity for March and April, unlike many other airlines. It is still considering options to respond to the coronavirus epidemic that has hit the travel industry hard in the past month. The Seattle-based carrier's executives told analysts at the JP Morgan Aviation, Transportation and Industrials Conference on 10 March that they are eyeing capacity cuts of up to 3.2% for May, but no concrete decisions have been made. “We do expect to fly less, we're just not providing guidance on that right now,” Alaska's president Ben Minicucci tells analysts at the conference. The company is analysing “the need to consolidate frequencies or trim flights that would operate at a cash loss in May and beyond,” it says in its presentation to the conference. “We are trying not to have this crisis change our longer-term focus and strategic plan,” Minicucci says. “We have put a lot of time into what we want to do in the next couple of years. We don't want to knee jerk and throw all that away.” Alaska is continually assessing on “how to get the right mix of airplanes in our fleet and getting a lot smarter about what the fleet needs to look like in the next couple of years,” he adds. “We are not going to knee jerk on anything because of the virus,” he says. Minicucci says load factors in January and February were up three and two percentage points respectively, and bookings in March and April were strong and in line with expectations before the virus hit. Since 24 February, the airline has seen 265,000 fewer bookings than in March 2019, and 270,000 cancellations for the month. “These are material impacts,” Minicucci says. Should the crisis drag on, Alaska is able to reduce the fleet in an organised and flexible fashion, executives say. Retirements and returns of aircraft on an accelerated schedule, as well as the return of slots and sale of other assets such as real estate and other holdings are possible.",3,554,2.0,0.2194,"executive, chief, cut, add, situation, staff, crisis, make, coronavirus, employee","['alaska', 'plan', 'cut', 'capacity', 'march', 'april', 'unlike', 'many', 'still', 'consider', 'option', 'respond', 'coronavirus', 'epidemic', 'hit', 'travel', 'industry', 'hard', 'past', 'month', 'seattlebased', 'carrier', 'executive', 'told', 'analyst', 'jp', 'morgan', 'transportation', 'industrials', 'conference', 'march', 'eye', 'capacity', 'cut', 'may', 'concrete', 'decision', 'make', 'expect', 'fly', 'less', 'provide', 'guidance', 'right', 'alaska', 'president', 'ben', 'minicucci', 'tell', 'analyst', 'conference', 'analyse', 'need', 'consolidate', 'frequency', 'trim', 'operate', 'cash', 'loss', 'may', 'beyond', 'say', 'presentation', 'conference', 'try', 'crisis', 'change', 'longerterm', 'focus', 'strategic', 'plan', 'minicucci', 'say', 'put', 'lot', 'want', 'next', 'couple', 'want', 'knee', 'jerk', 'throw', 'alaska', 'continually', 'assess', 'get', 'right', 'mix', 'airplane', 'fleet', 'get', 'lot', 'smarter', 'fleet', 'need', 'look', 'like', 'next', 'couple', 'add', 'go', 'knee', 'jerk', 'anything', 'virus', 'say', 'minicucci', 'say', 'load', 'factor', 'january', 'february', 'percentage', 'point', 'respectively', 'booking', 'march', 'april', 'strong', 'line', 'expectation', 'virus', 'hit', 'since', 'february', 'see', 'booking', 'march', 'cancellation', 'month', 'material', 'impact', 'minicucci', 'say', 'crisis', 'drag', 'alaska', 'able', 'reduce', 'fleet', 'organise', 'flexible', 'fashion', 'executive', 'say', 'retirement', 'return', 'accelerate', 'schedule', 'well', 'return', 'slot', 'sale', 'asset', 'real', 'estate', 'holding', 'possible']"
"Norwegian has disclosed plans to cut 3,000 flights between mid-March and mid-June, and is calling for action from authorities to “reduce the financial burden” on the airline sector.

Schram recently acknowledged that the airline had yet to find a way of making its long-haul low-cost flights profitable. It has launched several rights issues in recent years and delayed bond repayments, while in 2019 credit-card companies began withholding payments to Norwegian until flights took place.

"Delta Air Lines has cut near-term capacity by at least 15% and has started hoarding cash in response to the coronavirus outbreak, which has pushed the carrier's bookings down by as much as 30%. “We are prepared to do more as the situation evolves,” Delta chief executive Ed Bastian said during the JP Morgan Industrials Conference on 10 March, and the airline is “prepared for it to get worse”. Also on 10 March, American Airlines disclosed it will reduce April domestic capacity by 7.5% and cut summer international capacity by 10%. Last week, United Airlines announced similar reductions. Bastian says his carrier's net bookings had recently tumbled by 25-30%, prompting the planned 15% capacity cut. To get there, Delta will reduce domestic capacity by 10-15% and slash international capacity by 20-25%. “Domestic is where we have the most uncertainty, as booking trends have worsened materially over the past week,” says Delta president Glen Hauenstein. Domestic cuts will be achieved partly by trimming flights on “high-frequency markets”. “With recent developments, we are parking both widebody and narrowbody aircraft and are evaluating early retirement of older, less-efficient airplanes,” Hauenstein adds. Internationally, Pacific flights will be most affected, but Atlanta-based Delta will also trim transatlantic capacity by 15-20%. It has suspended New York-Tel Aviv flights and reduced leisure-heavy routes. March load factors will be 65-70%, down about 20 points year-on-year, with leisure and business markets affected, Bastian says. The coronavirus outbreak has forced Delta into cash-saving mode: it plans to reduce 2020 expenses by $1.8 billion, executives say. “Our overarching goal during this time is cash preservation,” Bastian says. Delta has implemented a hiring freeze and offered voluntary leave to staff, and the grounded aircraft will significantly reduce maintenance expenses, says Bastian. Delta does not say how many aircraft it will remove from service. The airline is suspending stock repurchases and deferring $500 million in planned 2020 capital expenditures and $500 million in planned 2020 pension contributions. Declining fuel prices, which are down about 20% year-on-year, will help offset the coronavirus impact, Delta says.

"Air France-KLM figures showing traffic on Asia-Pacific routes down a quarter in February provide the first clear passenger data illustrating the impact on European carriers of the coronavirus outbreak. The Franco-Dutch firm is the first of the big three European carriers groups to disclose February traffic data, the first full month in which routes to mainland China in particular were impacted by the outbreak. Air France and KLM in late January began suspending flights to China, where between them they serve Beijing, Chengdu, Hangzhou, Shanghai, Wuhan and Xiamen. Air France-KLM passenger traffic was down 24.7% on Asia routes in February compared with the same month in 2019. The fall in traffic far outstripped the group's reduction in capacity in this sector by 15.8% - resulting in an almost 10 point fall in load factor on its Asian routes to 80.9%. While traffic increased across most of the rest of its long-haul network, its overall long-haul passenger traffic was down 1.4%. February figures also provide the first indication of the impact on short-haul traffic, as the outbreak in northern Italy started to impact demand during the month. Short-haul passenger traffic was down 1.8%. Again this outpaced efforts to trim capacity. The group's short-haul capacity was increased fractionally in February, leading to a nearly two point fall in load factors in this sector. Overall group Air France-KLM traffic fell 1.4% on capacity increased 1.9%. As a result group load factor was fell almost three points to 83.6%. The drop in traffic is even larger than the monthly figures suggest, as February data includes an extra day of the same month in 2018 because 2020 is a leap year. ”The following months will be more impacted given the expansion of Covid-19 on other parts of the world and the extension of capacity reduction,” Air France-KLM warns in disclosing its traffic figures today. For March it notes Air France expects to cancel 3,600 flights during March including a 13% reduction in long-haul capacity, a 25% cut across its European network and is reducing its domestic network capacity 17%.

"Dutch prosecutors have taken into account that Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 might have been unintentionally shot down, mistaken for a military aircraft, but stress that this does not alter the criminal charges directed at the suspects. In his opening statement to the trial – in absentia – of four suspects indicted over the Boeing 777-200ER's destruction in July 2014, prosecutor Ward Ferdinandusse admitted that it was “perfectly conceivable” that the “true intention” of the defendants was to bring down a Ukrainian armed forces aircraft. “Several items of evidence point to this scenario, including intercepted conversations the defendants had after the downing occurred,” he told the court in The Hague. “When drawing up the indictment we explicitly took account of this 'error scenario'.” But Ferdinandusse pointed out that the charges concentrate on laws prohibiting action to cause an aircraft to crash “regardless” of the aircraft type and whether resulting fatalities are military personnel or civilians. Anyone destroying a Royal Netherlands Air Force fighter can be prosecuted under the Dutch criminal code, he said, for the murder of its pilot. “Offences in the indictment are as applicable to the downing of a military aircraft as to the downing of a civilian aircraft,” he stated. “Any error concerning the target makes no difference in respect of the proof that such offences were committed.”  Ferdinandusse also pointed out that, while an armed conflict was taking place in Ukraine at the time MH17 was destroyed by a surface-to-air missile, this does not mean the suspects can claim combatant immunity, because such rules apply only to regular military personnel acting under the authority of a state and in an organisation that respects international humanitarian law – not to independent fighting groups. “Other people who commit acts of violence in an armed conflict are subject to the ordinary rules laid down in criminal law,” he said. “War is not a mandate for violence by all.” The prosecution views the four suspects as having been instrumental in delivering and deploying the Buk mobile missile launcher used against MH17. “We do not think that these defendants pressed the button that launched the [missile],” said Ferdinandusse. But he alleges that they played a “significant co-ordinating role” in transporting and positioning the weapon and, following the destruction of the 777, transferring it back to Russia – meaning that they were “so closely involved that they can be held responsible under criminal law for the downing of flight MH17”.",3,558,10.0,0.4787,"international, authority, civil, state, investigation, case, add, january, airasia, crash","['dutch', 'prosecutor', 'take', 'account', 'malaysia', 'might', 'unintentionally', 'shot', 'mistaken', 'military', 'stress', 'alter', 'criminal', 'charge', 'direct', 'suspect', 'opening', 'statement', 'trial', 'absentia', 'suspect', 'indict', 'destruction', 'july', 'prosecutor', 'ward', 'ferdinandusse', 'admit', 'perfectly', 'conceivable', 'true', 'intention', 'defendant', 'bring', 'ukrainian', 'arm', 'force', 'several', 'item', 'evidence', 'point', 'scenario', 'include', 'intercept', 'conversation', 'defendant', 'occur', 'told', 'court', 'hague', 'draw', 'indictment', 'explicitly', 'take', 'account', 'ferdinandusse', 'point', 'charge', 'concentrate', 'law', 'prohibit', 'action', 'cause', 'crash', 'regardless', 'type', 'whether', 'result', 'fatality', 'military', 'personnel', 'civilian', 'anyone', 'destroy', 'royal', 'netherlands', 'force', 'fighter', 'prosecute', 'dutch', 'criminal', 'code', 'say', 'murder', 'pilot', 'offence', 'indictment', 'applicable', 'military', 'civilian', 'state', 'error', 'concern', 'target', 'make', 'difference', 'respect', 'proof', 'offence', 'ferdinandusse', 'point', 'arm', 'conflict', 'take', 'place', 'ukraine', 'destroyed', 'surfacetoair', 'missile', 'mean', 'suspect', 'claim', 'combatant', 'immunity', 'rule', 'apply', 'regular', 'military', 'personnel', 'act', 'authority', 'state', 'organisation', 'respect', 'international', 'humanitarian', 'law', 'independent', 'fight', 'people', 'commit', 'act', 'violence', 'arm', 'conflict', 'subject', 'ordinary', 'rule', 'laid', 'criminal', 'law', 'say', 'war', 'mandate', 'violence', 'prosecution', 'view', 'suspect', 'instrumental', 'deliver', 'deploy', 'buk', 'mobile', 'missile', 'launcher', 'use', 'think', 'defendant', 'press', 'button', 'launch', 'missile', 'say', 'ferdinandusse', 'alleges', 'played', 'significant', 'coordinate', 'role', 'transport', 'position', 'weapon', 'follow', 'destruction', 'transfer', 'back', 'russia', 'meaning', 'closely', 'involve', 'held', 'responsible', 'criminal', 'law']"
"A Thai Airways A330-300 has nearly ripped the tail off a Gulfstream IV private jet during a taxiing accident in Vientiane, Laos. The accident occurred in darkness on 9 March as the A330 (HS-TEU) prepared to operate flight TG575 on the Vientiane-Bangkok Suvarnabhumi route, according to Thai Airways. The Thai Airways A330 suffered damage to the leading edge of its outboard left wing. “When the pilot took the plane out to the taxiway, its wing collided with the tail of a small personal plane.” Images on social media show that the outboard leading edge of the A330's left wing suffered damage. As for the private jet, M-YWAY, the entire tail plane was nearly torn off, coming to rest on the right-side horizontal stabilizer. The front landing gear also appears to have been severely twisted in its mounting. The Thai aircraft was carrying 79 passengers and 13 crew, all of whom are safe, says the airline. The Gulfstream IV saw its entire tail shorn off. Cirium fleets data indicates that HS-TEU is managed by Thai and was delivered in March 2010, though it only entered service in June 2011. The private jet, M-YWAY, is managed and operated by Blue Sky Leasing of the Cayman Islands. It entered service in 2002 for Philip Morris, and was obtained by Blue Sky in 2010.",3,559,7.0,0.2084,"crew, runway, inquiry, land, approach, accident, investigator, captain, incident, pilot","['thai', 'airway', 'nearly', 'ripped', 'tail', 'gulfstream', 'iv', 'private', 'jet', 'taxi', 'accident', 'vientiane', 'lao', 'accident', 'occur', 'darkness', 'march', 'hsteu', 'prepared', 'operate', 'vientianebangkok', 'suvarnabhumi', 'route', 'accord', 'thai', 'airway', 'thai', 'airway', 'suffer', 'damage', 'lead', 'edge', 'outboard', 'left', 'wing', 'pilot', 'take', 'plane', 'taxiway', 'wing', 'collide', 'tail', 'small', 'personal', 'image', 'social', 'medium', 'outboard', 'lead', 'edge', 'left', 'wing', 'suffer', 'damage', 'private', 'jet', 'myway', 'entire', 'tail', 'plane', 'nearly', 'torn', 'come', 'rest', 'rightside', 'horizontal', 'stabilizer', 'front', 'land', 'gear', 'appear', 'severely', 'twist', 'mount', 'thai', 'carry', 'passenger', 'crew', 'safe', 'say', 'gulfstream', 'iv', 'saw', 'entire', 'tail', 'shorn', 'fleet', 'data', 'indicates', 'hsteu', 'manage', 'thai', 'deliver', 'march', 'though', 'enter', 'service', 'june', 'private', 'jet', 'myway', 'manage', 'operate', 'blue', 'sky', 'lease', 'cayman', 'island', 'enter', 'service', 'philip', 'morris', 'obtain', 'blue', 'sky']"
"Hawaiian Airlines is struggling with a dramatic decline in business due to the global COVID-19 epidemic, as passengers cancel both international and, increasingly, domestic travel in an effort to protect themselves from becoming infected. The crisis has become so critical for airlines that the Honolulu-based carrier decided to cancel its planned investor day, scheduled for 9 March. Instead, chief executive Peter Ingram gave industry analysts an update on the airline's anticipated decline in business as the global crisis continues to unfold. “The spread of the novel coronavirus and COVID-19 is now an international health emergency,” Ingram says. “This is very different from a weak economic situation where people want to travel but don't have the means to travel. This is driven by the level of anxiety that has built around travel and anxiety in general of spread of disease. We are dealing with a crisis in consumer confidence around travel and the uncertainty that is being created from all this.” Earlier in the day the airline withdrew its revenue per available seat mile (RASM) expectations for the first quarter of the year. The previous guidance had been for a decline of 4.5-7.5%. “The company is unable to provide an updated guidance range due to considerable uncertainty about the impact of COVID-19 on demand for the remainder of the quarter,” Hawaiian says in a statement. “If there are no new net bookings for March as of March 5, 2020, RASM would be down about 12 percent year-over-year for the first quarter.” “Things are evolving so much on a day-to-day basis so there is really no trend from which to predict,” Ingram tells analysts. “There are demand impacts across a range of geographies but the impacts are not uniform. Things continue to evolve quickly so it is difficult to extrapolate the past to predict the future.” Hawaiian suspended flights to South Korea's Seoul Incheon International airport in late February, as infections in that country exploded. The airline then halted some operations to Japan last week. South Korea represents about 3% of the airline's capacity, whereas Japan represents about 21%. The suspensions will last until at least the end of April. Ingram says Hawaiian's Japan load factors at this time of year are usually in the high 80 to low 90 percentile range, and have fallen between “mid-teens to 20 percentage points” from the same time last year. “Clearly there will be significant revenue impact,” Ingram says, without quantifying what that impact will be. For the domestic market, Ingram says bookings were holding in line with expectations for most of February until the month's final week, when the airline began to see “measurable declines”. “Were there some improvement in news flow, a reduction in number cases in certain geographies, more information specifically about how the disease spreads and how it doesn't spread, those are all things that I think will help restore consumer confidence,” Ingram says. The carrier says the decrease in capacity caused by the temporary suspension of service to South Korea is “largely offset” by an increase in capacity due to upgauges on North America routes for operational reasons. These operational reasons include maintenance-related downtimes on some of the airline's A321neo fleet, Ingram says. The aircraft's Pratt & Whitney PW1100G-series engine were subject to “unintended shop visits”. During the first quarter, up to three A321neos were out of service at the same time, so service was upgauged to the airline's A330 which were no longer flying to Asia. SLOT RELIEF Another problem facing airlines managing through the decline in demand is securing slots at specific airports around the world. Most locations require airlines use slots at least 80% of the time in order to maintain take-off and landing rights. So far Hawaiian has been able to meet that requirement despite cancelling flights, Ingram says. Airports within the carrier's network that have these slot rules include Tokyo, Seoul Incheon, John F Kennedy in New York, Auckland, Sydney and Brisbane. Last week, industry lobbyist IATA asked jurisdictions to relax the rules, arguing that strict adherence to the regulations may deny airlines the flexibility to respond to the coronavirus outbreak and result in airlines flying empty aircraft in order to hold onto slots. Ingram says he hopes that Hawaiian won't have to make “irresponsible” decisions of flying empty aircraft just to maintain slot privileges. “It doesn't make sense to fly for slot protection purposes only.” On Monday, the European Commission said it is considering slot relief for certain routes. Slot rules were relaxed by the Commission during previous periods of financial stress for airlines after the 11 September 2001 attacks, SARS and the Iraq war in 2003, and the financial crisis in 2009. Asked if the current situation feels like the 2001 attacks, Ingram says there are some similarities but also important differences. Both situations are “driven by fear and uncertainty about the risks associated with travel. In this case we have again a circumstance that is driven by fear. The key difference is what it is the fear of. In 2001 the fear of terrorism and uncertainty about what the next event was going to be in that extremely difficult time. Here it is a fear about a disease that still has a number of unknowns.” Hawaiian Airlines reports first quarter results in April.",3,560,5.0,0.2801,"carrier, march, international, outbreak, suspend, capacity, schedule, april, united, coronavirus","['hawaiian', 'struggle', 'dramatic', 'decline', 'business', 'due', 'global', 'coronavirus', 'epidemic', 'passenger', 'cancel', 'international', 'increasingly', 'domestic', 'travel', 'effort', 'protect', 'become', 'infect', 'crisis', 'become', 'critical', 'honolulubased', 'carrier', 'decide', 'cancel', 'plan', 'investor', 'day', 'schedule', 'march', 'instead', 'chief', 'executive', 'peter', 'ingram', 'give', 'industry', 'analyst', 'update', 'anticipate', 'decline', 'business', 'global', 'crisis', 'continue', 'unfold', 'spread', 'novel', 'coronavirus', 'coronavirus', 'international', 'health', 'emergency', 'ingram', 'say', 'different', 'weak', 'economic', 'situation', 'people', 'want', 'travel', 'mean', 'travel', 'driven', 'level', 'anxiety', 'built', 'around', 'travel', 'anxiety', 'general', 'spread', 'disease', 'deal', 'crisis', 'consumer', 'confidence', 'around', 'travel', 'uncertainty', 'create', 'earlier', 'day', 'withdrew', 'revenue', 'per', 'available', 'seat', 'mile', 'rasm', 'expectation', 'quarter', 'previous', 'guidance', 'decline', 'unable', 'provide', 'update', 'guidance', 'range', 'due', 'considerable', 'uncertainty', 'impact', 'coronavirus', 'demand', 'remainder', 'quarter', 'hawaiian', 'say', 'statement', 'net', 'booking', 'march', 'march', 'rasm', 'percent', 'yearoveryear', 'thing', 'evolve', 'much', 'daytoday', 'basis', 'really', 'trend', 'predict', 'ingram', 'tell', 'analyst', 'demand', 'impact', 'across', 'range', 'geography', 'impact', 'uniform', 'thing', 'continue', 'evolve', 'quickly', 'difficult', 'extrapolate', 'past', 'predict', 'hawaiian', 'suspend', 'south', 'korea', 'seoul', 'incheon', 'international', 'airport', 'late', 'february', 'infection', 'country', 'explode', 'halt', 'operation', 'japan', 'week', 'south', 'korea', 'represent', 'capacity', 'whereas', 'japan', 'represent', 'suspension', 'least', 'end', 'april', 'ingram', 'say', 'hawaiian', 'japan', 'load', 'factor', 'usually', 'high', 'low', 'percentile', 'range', 'fall', 'midteens', 'percentage', 'point', 'clearly', 'significant', 'revenue', 'impact', 'ingram', 'say', 'without', 'quantify', 'impact', 'domestic', 'market', 'ingram', 'say', 'booking', 'hold', 'line', 'expectation', 'february', 'month', 'final', 'week', 'begin', 'see', 'measurable', 'decline', 'improvement', 'news', 'flow', 'reduction', 'number', 'case', 'certain', 'geography', 'information', 'specifically', 'disease', 'spread', 'spread', 'thing', 'think', 'help', 'restore', 'consumer', 'confidence', 'ingram', 'say', 'carrier', 'say', 'decrease', 'capacity', 'cause', 'temporary', 'suspension', 'service', 'south', 'korea', 'largely', 'offset', 'increase', 'capacity', 'due', 'upgauges', 'north', 'america', 'route', 'operational', 'reason', 'operational', 'reason', 'include', 'maintenancerelated', 'downtime', 'fleet', 'ingram', 'say', 'pratt', 'whitney', 'engine', 'subject', 'unintended', 'shop', 'visit', 'quarter', 'service', 'service', 'upgauged', 'longer', 'fly', 'asia', 'slot', 'relief', 'another', 'problem', 'face', 'manage', 'decline', 'demand', 'secure', 'slot', 'specific', 'airport', 'around', 'world', 'location', 'require', 'use', 'slot', 'least', 'order', 'maintain', 'takeoff', 'land', 'right', 'far', 'hawaiian', 'able', 'meet', 'requirement', 'despite', 'cancel', 'ingram', 'say', 'airport', 'within', 'carrier', 'network', 'slot', 'rule', 'include', 'tokyo', 'seoul', 'incheon', 'john', 'f', 'kennedy', 'york', 'auckland', 'sydney', 'brisbane', 'week', 'industry', 'lobbyist', 'iata', 'ask', 'jurisdiction', 'relax', 'rule', 'argue', 'strict', 'adherence', 'regulation', 'may', 'deny', 'flexibility', 'respond', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'result', 'fly', 'empty', 'order', 'hold', 'onto', 'slot', 'ingram', 'say', 'hope', 'hawaiian', 'wo', 'make', 'irresponsible', 'decision', 'fly', 'empty', 'maintain', 'slot', 'privilege', 'make', 'sense', 'fly', 'slot', 'protection', 'purpose', 'monday', 'european', 'commission', 'say', 'consider', 'slot', 'relief', 'certain', 'route', 'slot', 'rule', 'relaxed', 'commission', 'previous', 'period', 'financial', 'stress', 'september', 'attack', 'sars', 'iraq', 'war', 'financial', 'crisis', 'ask', 'current', 'situation', 'feel', 'like', 'attack', 'ingram', 'say', 'similarity', 'important', 'difference', 'situation', 'driven', 'fear', 'uncertainty', 'risk', 'associate', 'travel', 'case', 'circumstance', 'driven', 'fear', 'key', 'difference', 'fear', 'fear', 'terrorism', 'uncertainty', 'next', 'event', 'go', 'extremely', 'difficult', 'fear', 'disease', 'still', 'number', 'hawaiian', 'report', 'quarter', 'result', 'april']"
"Investigators probing the fatal Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 737 Max accident have given additional insight into a crucial period during which the crew, having temporarily stopped the aircraft from automatically nosing down, struggled vainly to regain pitch and trim control. In an interim update into the 10 March 2019 crash near Addis Ababa, which does not yet feature a full analysis, the Ethiopian accident investigation bureau says the differences training provided by Boeing – to convert 737 pilots to the 737 Max – was “inadequate”. It adds that the reliance of the controversial Manoeuvring Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) on a single angle-of-attack sensor input left it “vulnerable to undesired activation”. When the sensor, on the left-hand side of the jet, started transmitting bad angle-of-attack data, MCAS responded by repeatedly triggering the stabiliser trim to force the aircraft's nose down, and causing the pilots to counter by pulling on their control columns. But while MCAS triggered on four occasions, the third of these had no effect on the aircraft's pitch because – for a period of 2min 33s – the crew had been flying the jet with the stabiliser trim cut-out engaged. Engaging the trim cut-out de-activates MCAS and, for this critical period, the crew would not have been battling directly against MCAS to control the aircraft's pitch. The inquiry says the captain, at this point, succeeded in increasing the aircraft's pitch, and the 737 started climbing at 1,800ft/min. He asked for the first officer to “pull with me” and, over the 2min 33s interval, the crew was applying an average of 94lb force to the control column. Pitch varied between 7° nose-up and 2° nose-down, increasing when both pilots pulled and falling when only a single pilot pulled, and this resulted in the vertical speed swinging between a 4,400ft/min climb and a 2,500ft/min descent. Air traffic control approved a request from the crew to climb to 14,000ft in order to troubleshoot their flight-control problems. The aircraft was travelling at excessive speed, some 360-375kt, and the captain made a “speed” call-out, which was acknowledged by the first officer. The captain again sought the first officer's help to pitch the aircraft nose-up, and then asked him whether the trim was functional. The first officer replied that the trim was not functioning, and asked if he could try to activate it manually, but subsequently stated: “It is not working.” At the time of the first officer's comment, the aircraft was mis-trimmed by 2.5 units and flying at 340kt. Simulations of the flight, with the thrust and trim settings at the time, aimed to evaluate the control column forces required for the climb and to turn the trim wheel. With both simulator pilots pulling they achieved a nose-up pitch of 5-10°. But the inquiry says: “The forces needed from both pilots to achieve this were considered significantly very high and unbearable for the duration held.” The simulations also revealed that, for the trim setting, the pilots could not move the trim wheel manually at speeds above 220kt. Around 40 manual turns of the trim wheel would have been required from the Ethiopian crew to correct the aircraft's 2.5-unit mis-trim. Several times the Ethiopian aircraft's captain remarked “keep with me”, stating that they should continue climbing to 14,000ft. But the crew then decided instead to return to the airport. The inquiry states that, shortly afterwards, manual electric trim-up inputs were recorded, indicating that the stabiliser cut-out had been disengaged – enabling MCAS to continue triggering nose-down stabiliser trim. Investigators have not specifically stated why, having been engaged, the cut-out was subsequently disengaged, and whether this related to the difficulties with pulling the control column or turning the trim wheel. But the inquiry states that, with MCAS again active, the remainder of the flight lasted just 33s as it pushed the aircraft into its final fatal descent.",3,561,7.0,0.5558,"crew, runway, inquiry, land, approach, accident, investigator, captain, incident, pilot","['investigator', 'probe', 'fatal', 'ethiopian', 'accident', 'give', 'additional', 'insight', 'crucial', 'period', 'crew', 'temporarily', 'stop', 'automatically', 'nose', 'struggle', 'vainly', 'regain', 'pitch', 'trim', 'control', 'interim', 'update', 'march', 'crash', 'near', 'addis', 'ababa', 'yet', 'feature', 'full', 'analysis', 'ethiopian', 'accident', 'investigation', 'bureau', 'say', 'difference', 'training', 'provide', 'convert', 'pilot', 'inadequate', 'add', 'reliance', 'controversial', 'manoeuvre', 'characteristic', 'augmentation', 'system', 'mcas', 'single', 'angleofattack', 'sensor', 'input', 'left', 'vulnerable', 'undesired', 'activation', 'sensor', 'lefthand', 'side', 'jet', 'start', 'transmit', 'bad', 'angleofattack', 'data', 'mcas', 'respond', 'repeatedly', 'trigger', 'stabiliser', 'trim', 'force', 'nose', 'cause', 'pilot', 'counter', 'pull', 'control', 'column', 'mcas', 'trigger', 'occasion', 'third', 'effect', 'pitch', 'period', 'crew', 'fly', 'jet', 'stabiliser', 'trim', 'cutout', 'engage', 'engage', 'trim', 'cutout', 'deactivates', 'mcas', 'critical', 'period', 'crew', 'battling', 'directly', 'mcas', 'control', 'pitch', 'inquiry', 'say', 'captain', 'point', 'succeed', 'increase', 'pitch', 'start', 'climb', 'ask', 'officer', 'pull', 'interval', 'crew', 'apply', 'average', 'force', 'control', 'column', 'pitch', 'varied', 'noseup', 'nosedown', 'increase', 'pilot', 'pull', 'fall', 'single', 'pilot', 'pull', 'result', 'vertical', 'speed', 'swing', 'climb', 'descent', 'traffic', 'control', 'approve', 'request', 'crew', 'climb', 'order', 'troubleshoot', 'flightcontrol', 'problem', 'travel', 'excessive', 'speed', 'captain', 'make', 'speed', 'callout', 'acknowledge', 'officer', 'captain', 'sought', 'officer', 'help', 'pitch', 'noseup', 'ask', 'whether', 'trim', 'functional', 'officer', 'reply', 'trim', 'function', 'ask', 'try', 'activate', 'manually', 'subsequently', 'state', 'officer', 'comment', 'mistrimmed', 'unit', 'fly', 'simulation', 'thrust', 'trim', 'setting', 'aim', 'evaluate', 'control', 'column', 'force', 'require', 'climb', 'turn', 'trim', 'wheel', 'simulator', 'pilot', 'pull', 'achieve', 'noseup', 'pitch', 'inquiry', 'say', 'force', 'need', 'pilot', 'achieve', 'consider', 'significantly', 'high', 'unbearable', 'duration', 'simulation', 'reveal', 'trim', 'set', 'pilot', 'move', 'trim', 'wheel', 'manually', 'speed', 'around', 'manual', 'turn', 'trim', 'wheel', 'require', 'ethiopian', 'crew', 'correct', 'mistrim', 'several', 'ethiopian', 'captain', 'remark', 'keep', 'state', 'continue', 'climb', 'crew', 'decide', 'instead', 'return', 'airport', 'inquiry', 'state', 'shortly', 'afterwards', 'manual', 'electric', 'trimup', 'input', 'record', 'indicate', 'stabiliser', 'cutout', 'disengage', 'enable', 'mcas', 'continue', 'trigger', 'nosedown', 'stabiliser', 'trim', 'investigator', 'specifically', 'state', 'engage', 'cutout', 'subsequently', 'disengage', 'whether', 'related', 'difficulty', 'pull', 'control', 'column', 'turn', 'trim', 'wheel', 'inquiry', 'state', 'mcas', 'active', 'remainder', 'push', 'final', 'fatal', 'descent']"
"The organisers of the annual AERO Friedrichshafen aviation trade fair have postponed this year's show to an undetermined date due to fears about the global spread of the coronavirus, also known as COVID-19. The event was set to take place from 1-4 April in the southern German city of Friedrichshafen. It would have been the 28th annual AERO and would have featured more than 700 exhibitors. In 2019, more than 40,000 visitors attended the event. “The current situation with the coronavirus has resulted in a nasty domino effect,” said Klaus Wellmann, managing director of Messe Friedrichshafen, the trade fair complex that hosts the show, on 6 March. “The industry members of the general aviation community also see the health and economic risks of the upcoming trade fair as too high. We share this assessment, but it is with a heavy heart that we now need to take this serious step together.” The head of AERO, Roland Bosch, added, “I have never experienced a comparable situation in the last 30 years. In accordance with the saying 'Complete safety is an illusion; there are only varying degrees of risk and uncertainty,' we were convinced right up until the end that we would be able to overcome the challenge we were facing in the coronavirus.” “However, in recent days we received a very large number of cancellations and clear signals from our exhibitors and potential visitors, making it impossible to hold the event now,” he said. The show has become the largest general aviation event outside of the United States, and also the industry's most important non-US event. Friedrichshafen, located on Lake Constance, is home to Zeppelin, the world's first airship company, and the city is a historic centre for aviation and aerospace development since before the First World War.

"European safety authorities are proposing certification and operational measures to reduce risks linked to under-inflated tyres. The European Union Aviation Safety Agency has published a proposal to require monitoring to ensure tyre pressure does not fall below the minimum serviceable inflation threshold during operations. EASA says this can be achieved either through provision of a task within continued airworthiness instructions, requiring operators to perform tyre pressure checks at suitable intervals, or by installing a tyre-pressure monitor to alert the crew to unsafe inflation. Any amendment to the certification standard would only address new designs for large aircraft, but operators would have the option to retrofit systems or conduct regular pressure checks. “Incorrect tyre pressure and, in particular, the under-inflation of tyres, is a contributing factor to tyre- and wheel-failure-related accidents or incidents,” says EASA. Such occurrences are still taking place despite measures in the last four decades including maintenance improvements and increased design robustness. EASA says the overall number of tyre and wheel failures “has not decreased over recent years”, with around 60-80 events still happening annually. “Review of the reported occurrences indicates that a further reduction in the risk of a tyre failure is needed,” says the authority, pointing out that damage is not limited to the wheel assembly but can extend to the airframe and engines. EASA analysis of 130 serious incidents and accidents involving tyre or wheel failure found eight occurrences between 2002 and 2016 relating to tyre under-inflation – all of which took place during departure. Investigators of this fatal Learjet 60 accident found the tyres were badly under-inflated Two involved Boeing 747s, another an Airbus A340, but the most serious event was a fatal overrun during a rejected take-off by a Bombardier Learjet 60 at Columbia in 2008, when four main landing-gear tyres failed. US investigators found the Learjet's tyre pressures had not been checked for three weeks, and that the pressure at the time of the accident was just 140psi compared with the recommendation of 219psi.

"Criminal proceedings are set to commence against four individuals accused of murder in connection with the destruction of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 over eastern Ukraine six years ago. The four initial suspects are being prosecuted, in absentia, in a Dutch court in the The Hague over the 298 fatalities which resulted when the Boeing 777-200ER was shot down by a surface-to-air missile in July 2014. Arrest warrants were issued for the four – Igor Girkin, Sergei Dubinskiy, Oleg Pulatov and Leonid Kharchenko – in June last year, following an in-depth accident investigation and a parallel criminal probe. Proceedings in The Hague will begin on 9 March. The joint investigation between the Netherlands and four other countries, Ukraine, Malaysia, Belgium and Australia, is continuing and the five participants signed a co-operation extension agreement on the eve of the trial. Deputy chief public prosecutor Digna van Boetzelaer says the inquiry is a “long-term task” and that the trial “does not mean the investigation is finished”. She says the proceedings mark “an important step towards finding truth and accountability”. The Netherlands became the scene of another high-profile trial two decades ago, when two suspects were prosecuted for the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am Boeing 747 over Scotland. Prosecutors believe MH17 was shot down by a missile fired from an Almaz-Antey Buk mobile launcher during a period of conflict in eastern Ukraine. Several strikes against military aircraft had preceded the attack on the 777, but the airspace over the region – while restricted – had not been fully closed to commercial traffic.",3,564,10.0,0.383,"international, authority, civil, state, investigation, case, add, january, airasia, crash","['criminal', 'proceeding', 'set', 'commence', 'individual', 'accuse', 'murder', 'connection', 'destruction', 'malaysia', 'eastern', 'ukraine', 'ago', 'initial', 'suspect', 'prosecute', 'absentia', 'dutch', 'court', 'hague', 'fatality', 'result', 'shot', 'surfacetoair', 'missile', 'july', 'arrest', 'warrant', 'issue', 'igor', 'girkin', 'sergei', 'dubinskiy', 'oleg', 'pulatov', 'leonid', 'kharchenko', 'june', 'follow', 'indepth', 'accident', 'investigation', 'parallel', 'criminal', 'probe', 'proceeding', 'hague', 'begin', 'march', 'joint', 'investigation', 'netherlands', 'country', 'ukraine', 'malaysia', 'belgium', 'australia', 'continue', 'participant', 'sign', 'cooperation', 'extension', 'agreement', 'eve', 'trial', 'deputy', 'chief', 'public', 'prosecutor', 'digna', 'van', 'boetzelaer', 'say', 'inquiry', 'longterm', 'task', 'trial', 'mean', 'investigation', 'finish', 'say', 'proceeding', 'mark', 'important', 'step', 'towards', 'find', 'truth', 'accountability', 'netherlands', 'become', 'scene', 'another', 'highprofile', 'trial', 'decade', 'ago', 'suspect', 'prosecute', 'bombing', 'pan', 'scotland', 'prosecutor', 'believe', 'shot', 'missile', 'fire', 'almazantey', 'buk', 'mobile', 'launcher', 'period', 'conflict', 'eastern', 'ukraine', 'several', 'strike', 'military', 'precede', 'attack', 'airspace', 'region', 'restrict', 'fully', 'close', 'commercial', 'traffic']"
"The downturn in aerospace stocks won't halt Boeing and Collins Aerospace from investing in new commercial aircraft technologies, executives from those manufacturers said on 5 March during discussions at the US Chamber of Commerce aviation summit in Washington, DC. The aviation industry has proven adaptability and will continue to innovate through the double crises of the Boeing 737 Max grounding and the coronavirus outbreak that is driving a downturn in air transport demand, says Collins Aerospace president Stephen Timm during the conference. “This will be a blip – it's a serious blip that we have to deal with today,” Timm says. Boeing and Airbus are the largest customers of Collins, a subsidiary of United Technologies that built the flight deck displays for 737 Max aircraft and contributed work for the automated flight control software on those aircraft. These automated flight controls contributed to two fatal crashes, and Boeing is coordinating with the US Federal Aviation Administration to certificate 737 Max aircraft as safe to return to service. As regulators scrutinize new autonomous technologies for air travel Timm says “we're going to take a very pragmatic approach” during certification to ensure safety. Autonomy is becoming increasingly relevant for the fuel efficiency and safety of air travel but “for the foreseeable future you will see a pilot in command”, Timm says. Budgets for innovation or new aircraft face an uncertain year in 2020. Airlines globally during 2020 could lose between $63 billion to $113 billion in revenue as governments try to contain the coronavirus outbreak, IATA reports. That financial hurt adds to the lost revenue faced by airlines with grounded Max aircraft in their fleets. The grounding of Max aircraft contributed to a loss of $636 million for Boeing during the full year 2019, compared with the $10.5 billion profit in 2018. Even if Max aircraft are cleared to return to service in mid-2020 as Boeing asserts, the downturn in air transport demand could hinder aircraft purchases. Despite this financial hurt, Boeing chief executive of commercial airplanes Stanley Deal says during the conference “we haven't stopped innovating”, alluding to a new aircraft programme. “By definition we are going to continue to extend our product line,” Deal says. “We're very serious about a product that will be somewhere between the Max 10 and the [Boeing 787].” The Chicago-based airframer's original draft for a New Mid-market Airplane (NMA) called for a range of 4,000-5,000nm (7,400-9,300km) with 270 seats for airlines to replace ageing Boeing 757 and 767 fleets. Boeing's newly-appointed chief executive David Calhoun has said the airframer intends to challenge Airbus with a new aircraft programme and is reevaluating what the NMA should be. “We have a lot of things to do to bring the Max back, but we are still making investments in the future,” Deal says.",3,565,0.0,0.2431,"order, business, jet, delivery, production, customer, deliver, commercial, quarter, include","['downturn', 'stock', 'wo', 'halt', 'collins', 'invest', 'commercial', 'technology', 'executive', 'manufacturer', 'say', 'march', 'discussion', 'u', 'chamber', 'commerce', 'summit', 'washington', 'dc', 'industry', 'proven', 'adaptability', 'continue', 'innovate', 'double', 'crisis', 'ground', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'drive', 'downturn', 'transport', 'demand', 'say', 'collins', 'president', 'stephen', 'timm', 'conference', 'blip', 'serious', 'blip', 'deal', 'today', 'timm', 'say', 'large', 'customer', 'collins', 'subsidiary', 'united', 'technology', 'built', 'deck', 'display', 'contribute', 'work', 'automate', 'control', 'software', 'automate', 'control', 'contribute', 'fatal', 'crash', 'coordinate', 'u', 'federal', 'administration', 'certificate', 'safe', 'return', 'service', 'regulator', 'scrutinize', 'autonomous', 'technology', 'travel', 'timm', 'say', 'go', 'take', 'pragmatic', 'approach', 'certification', 'ensure', 'safety', 'autonomy', 'become', 'increasingly', 'relevant', 'fuel', 'efficiency', 'safety', 'travel', 'foreseeable', 'future', 'see', 'pilot', 'command', 'timm', 'say', 'budget', 'innovation', 'face', 'uncertain', 'globally', 'lose', 'revenue', 'government', 'try', 'contain', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'iata', 'report', 'financial', 'hurt', 'add', 'lose', 'revenue', 'face', 'ground', 'fleet', 'ground', 'contribute', 'loss', 'full', 'compare', 'profit', 'even', 'clear', 'return', 'service', 'asserts', 'downturn', 'transport', 'demand', 'hinder', 'purchase', 'despite', 'financial', 'hurt', 'chief', 'executive', 'commercial', 'airplane', 'stanley', 'deal', 'say', 'conference', 'stop', 'innovate', 'allude', 'programme', 'definition', 'go', 'continue', 'extend', 'product', 'line', 'deal', 'say', 'serious', 'product', 'somewhere', 'chicagobased', 'airframer', 'original', 'draft', 'midmarket', 'airplane', 'nma', 'call', 'range', 'seat', 'replace', 'age', 'fleet', 'newlyappointed', 'chief', 'executive', 'david', 'calhoun', 'say', 'airframer', 'intend', 'challenge', 'programme', 'reevaluate', 'nma', 'lot', 'thing', 'bring', 'back', 'still', 'make', 'investment', 'future', 'deal', 'say']"
"Italian flag-carrier Alitalia is suspending all operations at Milan Malpensa, and limiting Milan Linate to domestic services, following the extraordinary government decree locking down the Lombardy region over the coronavirus outbreak. The airline says it will halt all services at Malpensa, its northern intercontinental base, from 9 March. Under the measures, which will run until 3 April, flights from Linate will serve only domestic destinations, with a reduced timetable. Alitalia had already been cutting back services as travel demand fell in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, which has particularly affected Italian cities. But it says that, following a radical government decree intended to contain the spread, it has implemented a plan to “re-organise” flights from Milan as well as Venice. Alitalia operates to New York JFK, Tokyo Narita and Rome from Malpensa, and multiple European destinations from Linate. The last flight into Malpensa ahead of the suspension will be AZ605 from New York, scheduled to arrive on 9 March. Alitalia will continue to operate international services from Rome Fiumicino. While it will maintain links between Venice and Rome – a busy connection, with some 35 weekly flights – it will cut back the frequency. Italy's government has laid out “urgent” actions in a decree covering the Lombardy region and a number of provinces, including restrictions on access, cancellation of organised events, and closure of museums and educational facilities. Alitalia's cutback at Milan will take place as the flag-carrier's commissioner is seeking expressions of interest from potential bidders for the embattled airline's business activities.",3,566,4.0,0.2275,"airport, fleet, service, data, carrier, operation, passenger, number, operate, operator","['italian', 'flagcarrier', 'alitalia', 'suspend', 'operation', 'milan', 'malpensa', 'limit', 'milan', 'linate', 'domestic', 'service', 'follow', 'extraordinary', 'government', 'decree', 'lock', 'lombardy', 'region', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'say', 'halt', 'service', 'malpensa', 'northern', 'intercontinental', 'base', 'march', 'measure', 'run', 'april', 'linate', 'serve', 'domestic', 'destination', 'reduce', 'timetable', 'alitalia', 'already', 'cut', 'back', 'service', 'travel', 'demand', 'fell', 'wake', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'particularly', 'affected', 'italian', 'city', 'say', 'follow', 'radical', 'government', 'decree', 'intend', 'contain', 'spread', 'implement', 'plan', 'reorganise', 'milan', 'well', 'venice', 'alitalia', 'operates', 'york', 'jfk', 'tokyo', 'narita', 'rome', 'malpensa', 'multiple', 'european', 'destination', 'linate', 'malpensa', 'ahead', 'suspension', 'york', 'schedule', 'arrive', 'march', 'alitalia', 'continue', 'operate', 'international', 'service', 'rome', 'fiumicino', 'maintain', 'link', 'venice', 'rome', 'busy', 'connection', 'weekly', 'cut', 'back', 'frequency', 'italy', 'government', 'laid', 'urgent', 'action', 'decree', 'cover', 'lombardy', 'region', 'number', 'province', 'include', 'restriction', 'access', 'cancellation', 'organise', 'event', 'closure', 'museum', 'educational', 'facility', 'alitalia', 'cutback', 'milan', 'take', 'place', 'flagcarrier', 'commissioner', 'seek', 'expression', 'interest', 'potential', 'bidder', 'embattle', 'business', 'activity']"
"After suspending its flights to South Korea in late February, Hawaiian Airlines now has halted flights from Hawaii to Tokyo's Haneda International airport following declining demand for capacity to Asia amid the spiraling scare of the highly contagious coronavirus, also known as COVID-19. Hawaiian says that beginning on 28 March it will temporarily suspend thrice-weekly service between Kona and Haneda, as well as four-times-weekly service between its home base Honolulu and Haneda. The suspensions will last until at least the end of April. At the same time, the carrier says it will launch a previously planned additional daily nonstop flight between Honolulu and Haneda. The new flight will bring guests to Honolulu early in the morning so that guests may catch connecting flights to other islands more easily. “Japan is a vitally important market for our airline, and we have been looking forward to launching our third nonstop flight between Honolulu and Haneda, which offers more convenient connecting times for our guests,” Hawaiian's president and chief executive Peter Ingram says on 6 March. “Unfortunately, the spread of COVID-19 beyond Asia has diminished near-term global travel demand, so we are balancing some of our Haneda capacity by suspending for about a month our hybrid service between Haneda and Honolulu and Kona” he adds. Hawaiian had hoped its service to Haneda would anchor a proposed joint venture with Japan Airlines, which is currently stuck in US regulatory red tape. The airlines are awaiting a decision by the Department of Transportation regarding antitrust immunity for the venture. In November, the airlines submitted documents addressing the regulator's concerns about the venture's geographic scope, its public benefit and offering improvements to technology infrastructure to allow metal-neutral pricing and more efficient passenger processing. Hawaiian had projected 2020 to be a major year of tourism for Japan with the Summer Olympics that are due to be held in July in Tokyo. “Once the changes take place, Hawaiian's Japan-Hawai'i network of 35 weekly flights will include three daily nonstop flights connecting Honolulu and Tokyo: two flights serving Haneda and one flight serving Narita International airport,” the airline says. Hawaiian also operates daily service between Honolulu and Osaka, four weekly flights between Honolulu and Fukuoka, and three weekly flights between Honolulu and Sapporo. When the flights are reinstated, Hawaiian will offer 42 weekly connections between Hawaii and Japan. Hawaiian cancelled its flights between Hawaii and South Korea's Seoul Incheon International airport on 26 February, as South Korea became one of the hotspots of the rapidly spreading coronavirus. Other US airlines have also cut back services to Asia, with United Airlines reducing its international schedule by 20%, beginning in April, earlier this week. The Chicago-based carrier had already suspended some of its flights to Tokyo, Osaka, Singapore and Seoul and extended its flight cancellations to mainland China and Hong Kong through 30 April. Delta Air Lines also slashed service to Japan this week, and said it would delay a plan to launch flights from Seoul to Manila. The Atlanta-based carrier says it will not operate a previously-planned summer-season flight between Seattle and Osaka, and reduce weekly flights to other Japan cities. Delta had intended to operate the Seattle-Osaka route from late March to mid-October, according to Cirium schedules data. The airline will resume the service in 2021, it says. North America is expected to make up about 20% of the up to $113 billion in global airline losses that IATA is forecasting should the coronavirus outbreak not be contained in current markets that have more than 100 cases.",3,567,5.0,0.5818,"carrier, march, international, outbreak, suspend, capacity, schedule, april, united, coronavirus","['suspend', 'south', 'korea', 'late', 'february', 'hawaiian', 'halt', 'hawaii', 'tokyo', 'haneda', 'international', 'airport', 'follow', 'decline', 'demand', 'capacity', 'asia', 'amid', 'spiral', 'scare', 'highly', 'contagious', 'coronavirus', 'know', 'coronavirus', 'hawaiian', 'say', 'begin', 'march', 'temporarily', 'suspend', 'thriceweekly', 'service', 'kona', 'haneda', 'well', 'fourtimesweekly', 'service', 'home', 'base', 'honolulu', 'haneda', 'suspension', 'least', 'end', 'april', 'carrier', 'say', 'launch', 'previously', 'plan', 'additional', 'daily', 'nonstop', 'honolulu', 'haneda', 'bring', 'guest', 'honolulu', 'early', 'morning', 'guest', 'may', 'catch', 'connect', 'island', 'easily', 'japan', 'vitally', 'important', 'market', 'look', 'forward', 'launch', 'third', 'nonstop', 'honolulu', 'haneda', 'offer', 'convenient', 'connect', 'guest', 'hawaiian', 'president', 'chief', 'executive', 'peter', 'ingram', 'say', 'march', 'unfortunately', 'spread', 'coronavirus', 'beyond', 'asia', 'diminish', 'nearterm', 'global', 'travel', 'demand', 'balance', 'haneda', 'capacity', 'suspend', 'month', 'hybrid', 'service', 'haneda', 'honolulu', 'kona', 'add', 'hawaiian', 'hop', 'service', 'haneda', 'anchor', 'propose', 'joint', 'venture', 'japan', 'currently', 'stuck', 'u', 'regulatory', 'red', 'tape', 'await', 'decision', 'department', 'transportation', 'regard', 'antitrust', 'immunity', 'venture', 'november', 'submit', 'document', 'address', 'regulator', 'concern', 'venture', 'geographic', 'scope', 'public', 'benefit', 'offering', 'improvement', 'technology', 'infrastructure', 'allow', 'metalneutral', 'pricing', 'efficient', 'passenger', 'processing', 'hawaiian', 'project', 'major', 'tourism', 'japan', 'summer', 'olympics', 'due', 'held', 'july', 'tokyo', 'change', 'take', 'place', 'hawaiian', 'japanhawai', 'network', 'weekly', 'include', 'daily', 'nonstop', 'connect', 'honolulu', 'tokyo', 'serve', 'haneda', 'serve', 'narita', 'international', 'airport', 'say', 'hawaiian', 'operates', 'daily', 'service', 'honolulu', 'osaka', 'weekly', 'honolulu', 'fukuoka', 'weekly', 'honolulu', 'sapporo', 'reinstate', 'hawaiian', 'offer', 'weekly', 'connection', 'hawaii', 'japan', 'hawaiian', 'cancel', 'hawaii', 'south', 'korea', 'seoul', 'incheon', 'international', 'airport', 'february', 'south', 'korea', 'become', 'hotspot', 'rapidly', 'spread', 'coronavirus', 'u', 'cut', 'back', 'service', 'asia', 'united', 'reduce', 'international', 'schedule', 'begin', 'april', 'earlier', 'week', 'chicagobased', 'carrier', 'already', 'suspend', 'tokyo', 'osaka', 'singapore', 'seoul', 'extend', 'cancellation', 'mainland', 'hong', 'kong', 'april', 'delta', 'line', 'slash', 'service', 'japan', 'week', 'say', 'delay', 'plan', 'launch', 'seoul', 'manila', 'atlantabased', 'carrier', 'say', 'operate', 'previouslyplanned', 'summerseason', 'seattle', 'osaka', 'reduce', 'weekly', 'japan', 'city', 'delta', 'intend', 'operate', 'seattleosaka', 'route', 'late', 'march', 'midoctober', 'accord', 'schedule', 'data', 'resume', 'service', 'say', 'north', 'america', 'expect', 'make', 'global', 'loss', 'iata', 'forecasting', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'contain', 'current', 'market', 'case']"
"A US congressional committee investigating the Boeing 737 Max has issued a preliminary report highlighting alleged failures by Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration. The report from the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure comes nearly one year after the deadly crash of Ethiopian Airlines flight 302, which prompted the global grounding. The committee says its investigation remains ongoing and that it will introduce legislation in the coming weeks to “address failures in the certification process”. “Developing a transport category commercial aircraft that is compliant with FAA regulations, but fundamentally flawed and unsafe highlights an aviation oversight system in desperate need of repair,” say the preliminary findings. In a statement, Boeing says, “We have cooperated extensively for the past year with the committee's investigation. We will review this preliminary report”. The FAA says it “welcomes the observations” of the committee. “While the FAA's certification processes are well-established and have consistently produced safe aircraft designs, we are a learning agency and welcome the scrutiny. We are confident that our openness to observations and recommendations will further bolster aviation safety worldwide.” The committee's report says Boeing placed undue “pressures” on the 737 Max programme and relied on “faulty assumptions” in developing the Max's systems. “There was tremendous financial pressure on Boeing and subsequently the 737 Max programme to compete with Airbus' A320neo aircraft,” says the report.  The pressure resulted in cost cutting and intense efforts to meet schedule. “The committee's investigation has identified several instances where the desire to meet these goals and expectations jeopardised the safety of the flying public,” it says. The report notes that in 2012, to cut costs, Boeing reduced the Max's avionics regression testing by 2,000 work-hours, cut flight-test support by 3,000h and slashed 8,000h of engineering flight deck simulator work. The report faults Boeing for “concealment of crucial information” and cites “conflicts of interest” among Boeing staffers tasked with performing certification work. “Our committee's investigation will continue for the foreseeable future, as there are a number of leads we continue to chase down,” says committee chair Peter DeFazio in a statement. The report says Boeing made faulty assumptions about pilot responses to activation of the Max's Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS). As a result, Boeing designed that system, which pushes the aircraft's nose down, to rely on only a single angle-of-attack (AOA) indicator. Investigators have said a faulty AOA sensor precipitated the October 2018 crash of a Lion Air 737 Max 8. The Ethiopian crash report remains outstanding. Those crashes killed 346 people. The Lion Air accident report also cited notable problems with pilot performance and Lion's maintenance and operations. The committee's report says Boeing “withheld crucial information from the FAA, its customers and 737 Max pilots” by failing to initially disclose the existence of MCAS. Boeing also did not initially inform airlines that an AOA disagree alert was inoperative. At one point, an estimated 80% of 737 Max had inoperative AOA alerts, according to the report. The report says “multiple career FAA officials documented” cases in which FAA managers, “at the behest of Boeing”, overruled FAA technical experts who had raised concern about the safety of Boeing's design approaches. Those cases involved the 737 Max and a lightning protection feature on the 787, it says. The FAA's “poor, disjointed” communications kept FAA employees from making “informed decisions”, the report adds.",3,568,11.0,0.4028,"pilot, faa, issue, safety, include, report, require, training, ground, order","['u', 'congressional', 'committee', 'investigate', 'issue', 'preliminary', 'report', 'highlight', 'allege', 'failure', 'federal', 'administration', 'report', 'house', 'committee', 'transportation', 'infrastructure', 'come', 'nearly', 'deadly', 'crash', 'ethiopian', 'prompt', 'global', 'ground', 'committee', 'say', 'investigation', 'remains', 'ongoing', 'introduce', 'legislation', 'come', 'week', 'address', 'failure', 'certification', 'process', 'develop', 'transport', 'category', 'commercial', 'compliant', 'faa', 'regulation', 'fundamentally', 'flaw', 'unsafe', 'highlight', 'oversight', 'system', 'desperate', 'need', 'repair', 'say', 'preliminary', 'finding', 'statement', 'say', 'cooperate', 'extensively', 'past', 'committee', 'investigation', 'review', 'preliminary', 'report', 'faa', 'say', 'welcome', 'observation', 'committee', 'faa', 'certification', 'process', 'wellestablished', 'consistently', 'produce', 'safe', 'design', 'learn', 'agency', 'welcome', 'scrutiny', 'confident', 'openness', 'observation', 'recommendation', 'far', 'bolster', 'safety', 'committee', 'report', 'say', 'place', 'undue', 'pressure', 'programme', 'rely', 'faulty', 'assumption', 'develop', 'system', 'tremendous', 'financial', 'pressure', 'subsequently', 'programme', 'compete', 'say', 'report', 'pressure', 'result', 'cost', 'cut', 'intense', 'effort', 'meet', 'schedule', 'committee', 'investigation', 'identify', 'several', 'instance', 'desire', 'meet', 'goal', 'expectation', 'jeopardise', 'safety', 'fly', 'public', 'say', 'report', 'note', 'cut', 'cost', 'reduce', 'avionics', 'regression', 'test', 'workhours', 'cut', 'flighttest', 'support', 'slash', 'engineering', 'deck', 'simulator', 'work', 'report', 'fault', 'concealment', 'crucial', 'information', 'cite', 'conflict', 'interest', 'among', 'staffer', 'tasked', 'perform', 'certification', 'work', 'committee', 'investigation', 'continue', 'foreseeable', 'future', 'number', 'lead', 'continue', 'chase', 'say', 'committee', 'chair', 'peter', 'defazio', 'statement', 'report', 'say', 'make', 'faulty', 'assumption', 'pilot', 'response', 'activation', 'maneuvering', 'characteristic', 'augmentation', 'system', 'mcas', 'result', 'design', 'system', 'push', 'nose', 'rely', 'single', 'angleofattack', 'aoa', 'indicator', 'investigator', 'say', 'faulty', 'aoa', 'sensor', 'precipitate', 'october', 'crash', 'lion', 'ethiopian', 'crash', 'report', 'remains', 'outstanding', 'crash', 'kill', 'people', 'lion', 'accident', 'report', 'cite', 'notable', 'problem', 'pilot', 'performance', 'lion', 'maintenance', 'operation', 'committee', 'report', 'say', 'withheld', 'crucial', 'information', 'faa', 'customer', 'pilot', 'fail', 'initially', 'disclose', 'existence', 'mcas', 'initially', 'inform', 'aoa', 'disagree', 'alert', 'inoperative', 'point', 'estimate', 'inoperative', 'aoa', 'alert', 'accord', 'report', 'report', 'say', 'multiple', 'career', 'faa', 'official', 'document', 'case', 'faa', 'manager', 'behest', 'overrule', 'faa', 'technical', 'expert', 'raise', 'concern', 'safety', 'design', 'approach', 'case', 'involve', 'lightning', 'protection', 'feature', 'say', 'faa', 'poor', 'disjoint', 'communication', 'kept', 'faa', 'employee', 'make', 'inform', 'decision', 'report', 'add']"
"Lufthansa is evaluating a temporary grounding of its entire Airbus A380 fleet as part of capacity cuts in response to the coronavirus outbreak. The Star Alliance airline says it may reduce capacity by up to 50% over the coming weeks – more than previously planned – as a result of a “drastic decline” in bookings amid “exceptional circumstances”. Capacity cuts will be made at all passenger airlines across the group, it indicates. Lufthansa has 14 A380s, stationed in Frankfurt and Munich. The aim of any temporary grounding would be “to reduce the financial consequences of the slump in demand”, says the carrier. “The company is in talks with its operating partners and trade unions in order to avoid dismissals...by means of various part-time models,” adds Lufthansa, which in February introduced a recruitment freeze and multiple other cost-saving measures, including voluntary unpaid leave.

"Turkish Airlines is expecting to have 26 Airbus A321neos in its fleet by the end of this year, rather than the 30 it had listed in its previous update. The company has outlined its fleet development schedule in a full-year results briefing. While 13 A321neos were supposed to be delivered in 2019 – taking its overall fleet to 15 – the airline says it received 12. Turkish Airlines had also been expecting 15 A321neo deliveries for 2020 but it has cut this to 12 in its latest schedule. Airbus has been experiencing problems with industrial ramp-up of A321neo production. Turkish Airlines' single-aisle fleet expansion has also been affected by the Boeing 737 Max grounding. Its schedule does not commit to any 737 Max deliveries in 2020, whereas three months ago it was still indicating it would receive 38 this year. As a result the airline is listing 239 single-aisle jets, rather than 278, in its fleet by the end of 2020 – although the situation with Max deliveries remains uncertain. Turkish Airlines' full-year operating profit has halved $585 million, as revenues for the period failed to rise in line with expenditure. The flag-carrier's revenues were up by 2.9% to $13.2 billion but operating expenses increased to $12.6 billion, a rise of 8.2%. While fuel costs were up slightly, the main expenditure increases concerned personnel and depreciation. But the company benefited from tax adjustments and its net profit increased to $788 million from the previous $753 million. Profit for its SunExpress joint venture slipped to $62 million from the prior level of $67 million, despite a rise in revenues to $1.57 billion.",3,570,3.0,0.2445,"passenger, loss, operating, revenue, traffic, month, increase, capacity, decline, result","['turkish', 'expect', 'fleet', 'end', 'rather', 'list', 'previous', 'update', 'outline', 'fleet', 'development', 'schedule', 'fullyear', 'result', 'briefing', 'suppose', 'deliver', 'take', 'overall', 'fleet', 'say', 'receive', 'turkish', 'expect', 'delivery', 'cut', 'late', 'schedule', 'experience', 'problem', 'industrial', 'rampup', 'production', 'turkish', 'singleaisle', 'fleet', 'expansion', 'affected', 'ground', 'schedule', 'commit', 'delivery', 'whereas', 'month', 'ago', 'still', 'indicate', 'receive', 'result', 'listing', 'singleaisle', 'jet', 'rather', 'fleet', 'end', 'although', 'situation', 'delivery', 'remains', 'uncertain', 'turkish', 'fullyear', 'operating', 'profit', 'halve', 'revenue', 'period', 'fail', 'rise', 'line', 'expenditure', 'flagcarrier', 'revenue', 'operating', 'expense', 'increase', 'rise', 'fuel', 'cost', 'slightly', 'main', 'expenditure', 'increase', 'concerned', 'personnel', 'depreciation', 'benefit', 'tax', 'adjustment', 'net', 'profit', 'increase', 'previous', 'profit', 'sunexpress', 'joint', 'venture', 'slip', 'prior', 'level', 'despite', 'rise', 'revenue']"
"IATA has reiterated its call to governments and slot co-ordinators – including those in the European Commission – to ease slot rules, in light of the escalating coronavirus outbreak globally. Speaking at a briefing held after a two-day industry workshop in Singapore, IATA chief economist Brian Pearce says “the evidence is very strong”. Pearce, however, notes the “partial success” the association hashad  in lobbying governments and co-ordinators to ease slot rules. “We've seen the ...slot co-ordinators [in Mainland China] been very responsive to those rules, in the immediate situation. But airlines will need some certainty to plan and to move their fleet to markets which are still seeing demand from consumers. So, they [will] need slot waivers for a longer period of time,” Pearce adds. IATA has also seen receptivity in other markets, such as in parts of Canada and in Australia. Still, more can be done, and IATA is urging the European Commission, which has not yet moved on easing of slot rules, to “follow the sort of waiver that they have given...during the global financial crisis”. Existing slot rules at co-ordinated airports require airlines to operate at least 80% of their allocated slots under normal circumstances or risk losing the slots for the following season. IATA says 43% of all passengers depart from the more than 200 slot co-ordinated airports. Pearce's comments come about a week after the airline association urged regulators to suspend the rules governing airport slots for the remainder of the current season, and the upcoming summer timetables. Asked for its take on travel restrictions, IATA vice president for corporate communications Anthony Concil says that while the association “[respects] the right of governments” to impose restrictions – including travel bans – it is hoping for greater collaboration and clarity. The World Health Organisation has maintained its position against travel restrictions or travel bans, stating that these do not necessarily stop the spread of the coronavirus outbreak. Increasingly, a growing list of countries have began imposing restrictions on travellers from outbreak-stricken areas, such as from China, Italy, Iran and South Korea. Says Concil: “As an industry, our request is that we have some consistency, some advance notice, and absolute clarity, so we understand what [governments] need. “In some cases, we see these restrictions coming in very quickly, and without much explanation. We need to be able to deal with our passengers and to give them advice, and sometimes that's very difficult,” Concil adds.",3,571,9.0,0.34,"industry, crisis, demand, coronavirus, global, iata, market, level, cargo, expect","['iata', 'reiterate', 'call', 'government', 'slot', 'coordinator', 'include', 'european', 'commission', 'ease', 'slot', 'rule', 'light', 'escalate', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'globally', 'speak', 'briefing', 'held', 'twoday', 'industry', 'workshop', 'singapore', 'iata', 'chief', 'economist', 'brian', 'pearce', 'say', 'evidence', 'strong', 'pearce', 'however', 'note', 'partial', 'success', 'association', 'hashad', 'lobbying', 'government', 'coordinator', 'ease', 'slot', 'rule', 'see', 'slot', 'coordinator', 'mainland', 'responsive', 'rule', 'immediate', 'situation', 'need', 'certainty', 'plan', 'move', 'fleet', 'market', 'still', 'see', 'demand', 'consumer', 'need', 'slot', 'waiver', 'longer', 'period', 'pearce', 'add', 'iata', 'see', 'receptivity', 'market', 'part', 'canada', 'australia', 'still', 'iata', 'urge', 'european', 'commission', 'yet', 'move', 'ease', 'slot', 'rule', 'follow', 'sort', 'waiver', 'give', 'global', 'financial', 'crisis', 'exist', 'slot', 'rule', 'coordinate', 'airport', 'require', 'operate', 'least', 'allocate', 'slot', 'normal', 'circumstance', 'risk', 'lose', 'slot', 'follow', 'season', 'iata', 'say', 'passenger', 'depart', 'slot', 'coordinate', 'airport', 'pearce', 'comment', 'come', 'week', 'association', 'urge', 'regulator', 'suspend', 'rule', 'govern', 'airport', 'slot', 'remainder', 'current', 'season', 'upcoming', 'summer', 'timetable', 'ask', 'take', 'travel', 'restriction', 'iata', 'vice', 'president', 'corporate', 'communication', 'anthony', 'concil', 'say', 'association', 'respect', 'right', 'government', 'impose', 'restriction', 'include', 'travel', 'ban', 'hop', 'great', 'collaboration', 'clarity', 'world', 'health', 'organisation', 'maintain', 'position', 'travel', 'restriction', 'travel', 'ban', 'state', 'necessarily', 'stop', 'spread', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'increasingly', 'grow', 'list', 'country', 'begin', 'impose', 'restriction', 'traveller', 'outbreakstricken', 'area', 'italy', 'iran', 'south', 'korea', 'say', 'concil', 'industry', 'request', 'consistency', 'advance', 'notice', 'absolute', 'clarity', 'understand', 'government', 'need', 'case', 'see', 'restriction', 'come', 'quickly', 'without', 'much', 'explanation', 'need', 'able', 'deal', 'passenger', 'give', 'advice', 'sometimes', 'difficult', 'concil', 'add']"
"Avation has exercised its right to step into the sub-lease to Loganair of two ATR 72-600s, originally leased to collapsed British carrier Flybe. The Singapore-based lessor said on 19 February it placed the turboprops with Loganair, which was set to start operating them “in the coming weeks”. The aircraft were to remain with the Scottish carrier until just before the expiry of their Flybe leases. Cirium fleets data shows the leases on MSNs 1260 and 1277 are due to expire on 30 September 2021 and 9 October 2021, respectively. Cirium has asked Avation whether it has any plans to extend the leases. With Flybe's collapse and Avation exercising its rights to step into the sub-lease, Loganair becomes a direct customer of the lessor. All of Flybe's flights have been grounded and the UK business ceased trading on Thursday. This came after the government rejected the regional carrier's request for a £100 million ($129 million) loan. Meanwhile, financial pressure had been increasing on the carrier in recent days as air travel demand was impacted by the coronavirus outbreak. Cirium fleets data shows Loganair also operates two Britten-Norman BN-2 Bs, three Viking Air DHC-6-300s, three Embraer ERJ-135s, 13 ERJ-145s, two Saab 2000s, two Saab 340As, 14 Saab 340Bs.",3,572,8.0,0.2468,"government, uk, carrier, business, state, share, south, airway, financial, plan","['avation', 'exercise', 'right', 'step', 'sublease', 'loganair', 'atr', 'originally', 'lease', 'collapse', 'british', 'carrier', 'flybe', 'singaporebased', 'lessor', 'say', 'february', 'place', 'turboprop', 'loganair', 'set', 'start', 'operating', 'come', 'week', 'remain', 'scottish', 'carrier', 'expiry', 'flybe', 'lease', 'fleet', 'data', 'lease', 'msns', 'due', 'expire', 'september', 'october', 'respectively', 'ask', 'avation', 'whether', 'plan', 'extend', 'lease', 'flybe', 'collapse', 'avation', 'exercise', 'right', 'step', 'sublease', 'loganair', 'becomes', 'direct', 'customer', 'lessor', 'flybe', 'ground', 'uk', 'business', 'cease', 'trading', 'thursday', 'come', 'government', 'reject', 'regional', 'carrier', 'request', 'loan', 'meanwhile', 'financial', 'pressure', 'increase', 'carrier', 'recent', 'day', 'travel', 'demand', 'impact', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'fleet', 'data', 'loganair', 'operates', 'brittennorman', 'b', 'viking', 'embraer', 'saab', 'saab', 'saab']"
"Airlines with limited cash reserves face the greatest challenge in 2020 as businesses cancel travel plans and consumers reevaluate vacations due to the coronavirus, executives say 5 March during discussions at the US Chamber of Commerce aviation summit in Washington, DC. Air Canada chief executive Calin Rovinescu says that “cash and liquidity is number one” for navigating falling demand, as it was for the Montreal-based airline during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak that stifled air transport for half of 2003. “Coronavirus is obviously going to take a bite out of the industry as we know it,” Rovinescu says. The downturn in stock prices on virus concerns potentially offers a silver lining for prospective airline investors or for carriers mulling consolidation, Indigo Partners principal Brian Franke tells Cirium. “Our airlines today are in good shape, but we are looking for opportunities at airlines that don't have as strong a balance sheet,” Franke says, adding such carriers may be more receptive to consolidation. Indigo has stakes in several carriers including Frontier Airlines, Volaris and Wizz Air. Franke says these carriers are prepared to “ride out the storm” and are “looking at a variety of initiatives to maintain demand”. “We find in a challenging time people will trade down and look for less-expensive travel,” he says, creating potential demand for the ultra-low-cost carriers in Indigo's portfolio. Indigo Partners Bill Franke, father of Brian Franke, is chairman of Wizz Air, Frontier Airlines, JetSMART Airlines and Enerjet. He is also a director of Volaris. Franke and others speaking during the conference say the negative impact on the airline sector may continue even after the public health risk subsides. “We are getting to the point where the reaction to the virus may be worse than the virus itself,” Airlines for America (A4A) president Nicholas Calio says at the summit. Airlines globally during 2020 could lose between $63 billion to $113 billion in revenue as governments try to contain the coronavirus outbreak in 2020, IATA reports. The global drop in stock values for airlines dealt the final blow to financially troubled UK regional operator Flybe, which on 5 March ceased operations and entered administration. Virgin Atlantic says the negative impact of the coronavirus on Flybe's trading was a factor leading the Connect Airways consortium to decide it “can no longer commit to continued financial support”.",3,573,9.0,0.2536,"industry, crisis, demand, coronavirus, global, iata, market, level, cargo, expect","['limited', 'cash', 'reserve', 'face', 'great', 'challenge', 'business', 'cancel', 'travel', 'plan', 'consumer', 'reevaluate', 'vacation', 'due', 'coronavirus', 'executive', 'say', 'march', 'discussion', 'u', 'chamber', 'commerce', 'summit', 'washington', 'dc', 'canada', 'chief', 'executive', 'calin', 'rovinescu', 'say', 'cash', 'liquidity', 'number', 'navigate', 'fall', 'demand', 'montrealbased', 'severe', 'acute', 'respiratory', 'syndrome', 'sars', 'outbreak', 'stifle', 'transport', 'half', 'coronavirus', 'obviously', 'go', 'take', 'bite', 'industry', 'know', 'rovinescu', 'say', 'downturn', 'stock', 'price', 'virus', 'concern', 'potentially', 'offer', 'silver', 'line', 'prospective', 'investor', 'carrier', 'mull', 'consolidation', 'indigo', 'partner', 'principal', 'brian', 'franke', 'tell', 'today', 'good', 'shape', 'look', 'opportunity', 'strong', 'balance', 'sheet', 'franke', 'say', 'add', 'carrier', 'may', 'receptive', 'consolidation', 'indigo', 'stake', 'several', 'carrier', 'include', 'frontier', 'volaris', 'wizz', 'franke', 'say', 'carrier', 'prepared', 'ride', 'storm', 'look', 'variety', 'initiative', 'maintain', 'demand', 'find', 'challenge', 'people', 'trade', 'look', 'lessexpensive', 'travel', 'say', 'create', 'potential', 'demand', 'ultralowcost', 'carrier', 'indigo', 'portfolio', 'indigo', 'partner', 'bill', 'franke', 'father', 'brian', 'franke', 'chairman', 'wizz', 'frontier', 'jetsmart', 'enerjet', 'director', 'volaris', 'franke', 'others', 'speak', 'conference', 'say', 'negative', 'impact', 'sector', 'may', 'continue', 'even', 'public', 'health', 'risk', 'subsides', 'get', 'point', 'reaction', 'virus', 'may', 'bad', 'virus', 'america', 'president', 'nicholas', 'calio', 'say', 'summit', 'globally', 'lose', 'revenue', 'government', 'try', 'contain', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'iata', 'report', 'global', 'drop', 'stock', 'value', 'dealt', 'final', 'blow', 'financially', 'troubled', 'uk', 'regional', 'operator', 'flybe', 'march', 'cease', 'operation', 'enter', 'administration', 'virgin', 'atlantic', 'say', 'negative', 'impact', 'coronavirus', 'flybe', 'trading', 'factor', 'lead', 'connect', 'airway', 'consortium', 'decide', 'longer', 'commit', 'continued', 'financial', 'support']"
"Norwegian is cutting 22 long-haul flights between Europe and the USA between 28 March and 5 May, as passenger numbers dive as a result of the coronavirus outbreak. The airline says it has “during the past few days experienced reduced demand on some routes, particularly on future bookings”, adding: “Bookings for flights departing in the coming weeks are less affected.” It highlighted that it has relatively few flights to northern Italy, the centre of the outbreak in Europe. It also has a higher proportion of leisure travellers compared with some other airlines, and this segment is less impacted than business traffic. Yet the impact on passenger demand is severe enough for Norwegian to withdraw its 2020 guidance provided on 13 February, acknowledging that “at this stage, it is too early to assess the full impact on our business”. Routes affected by the changes are Rome to Los Angeles, Boston and New York, and London Gatwick to New York, which will reduce to twice daily on some dates, from thrice daily currently.

"Airlines globally could see lost passenger revenues of between $63 billion to $113 billion in 2020, depending on the extent of the coronavirus outbreak, says IATA, as it labels the impact “a crisis”. The association's latest assessment is more than twice its initial estimate of lost global airlines revenues losses resulting from the outbreak, when it on 20 February estimated a likely $29.3 million hit to airline revenues globally. The potential $113 billion passenger revenue hit is financially on par with what the industry experienced in 2009, during the global financial crisis. In its latest impact assessment, IATA paints two scenarios – one of “limited spread” of the viarus, and another of “extensive spread”. For the “limited spread” analysis, it took into account existing countries with at least 100 confirmed coronavirus cases. These include China, Singapore, Japan, Italy and Iran. It also estimates falls in consumer confidence in other markets in North America, Asia-Pacific and Europe. Of the $63 billion passenger revenue hit, IATA's assessment shows China accounting for more than a third of this. Markets associated with Asia, including China, would account for $47 billion of the total revenue loss. In its “extensive spread” analysis. IATA has included all countries with 10 or more confirmed coronavirus cases. As a whole, Asia-Pacific will see about $57 billion in passenger revenue loss, with the bulk made up of countries including China, Japan, South Korea, and Singapore. IATA had in its December outlook for the industry projected collective airline revenues would rise 4% to $872 billion (a figure that includes non-passenger revenues). However, falling oil prices could go some way in cushioning the outbreak's impact. The barrel price of Brent crude oil has fallen from almost $70 at the start of the year to around the $50 level. IATA estimates this could lower fuel costs by up to $28 billion. It though notes this would not “significantly cushion the devastating impact” of the outbreak on air travel demand, while flagging hedging “will postpone this impact for many airlines,”. IATA director general Alexandre de Juniac says the turn of events in recent days “is almost without precedent”. He says: “It is unclear how the virus will develop, but whether we see the impact contained to a few markets and a $63 billion revenue loss, or a broader impact leading to a $113 billion loss of revenue, this is a crisis.” At a media briefing held after a two-day industry workshop in Singapore, IATA chief economist Brian Pearce says it is unclear how soon the industry will rebound, especially given new clusters of transmission occurring outside of China, the epicentre of the outbreak. “[We could see] a later recovery in Europe...and possible signs of stabilisation of domestic travel in China. It is too early to tell at this point,” he adds. The association reiterates its call for relief measures to mitigate the outbreak's impact, including tax reliefs, reduction in charges, as well as the temporary easing of slot allocation rules. IATA's latest assessment comes a day after it released data showing that passenger traffic growth slowed to 2.4% in January – the weakest monthly increase in nearly 10 years. Revenue passenger-kilometres for Latin America and Asia-Pacific were worst hit, growing at 0.4% each. Europe showed growth by 1.6%, while the figures for Africa, the Middle East and North America were in the 5-6% range. De Juniac warned that January's data was “the tip of the iceberg” in terms of the impact of the coronavirus outbreak. This was because major travel restrictions in China only kicked in late-January, he notes.",3,575,9.0,0.4044,"industry, crisis, demand, coronavirus, global, iata, market, level, cargo, expect","['globally', 'see', 'lose', 'passenger', 'revenue', 'depend', 'extent', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'say', 'iata', 'label', 'impact', 'crisis', 'association', 'late', 'assessment', 'twice', 'initial', 'estimate', 'lose', 'global', 'revenue', 'loss', 'result', 'outbreak', 'february', 'estimate', 'likely', 'hit', 'revenue', 'globally', 'potential', 'passenger', 'revenue', 'hit', 'financially', 'par', 'industry', 'experienced', 'global', 'financial', 'crisis', 'late', 'impact', 'assessment', 'iata', 'paint', 'scenario', 'limited', 'spread', 'viarus', 'another', 'extensive', 'spread', 'limited', 'spread', 'analysis', 'take', 'account', 'exist', 'country', 'least', 'confirm', 'coronavirus', 'case', 'include', 'singapore', 'japan', 'italy', 'iran', 'estimate', 'fall', 'consumer', 'confidence', 'market', 'north', 'america', 'asiapacific', 'europe', 'passenger', 'revenue', 'hit', 'iata', 'assessment', 'accounting', 'third', 'market', 'associate', 'asia', 'include', 'account', 'total', 'revenue', 'loss', 'extensive', 'spread', 'analysis', 'iata', 'include', 'country', 'confirm', 'coronavirus', 'case', 'whole', 'asiapacific', 'see', 'passenger', 'revenue', 'loss', 'bulk', 'make', 'country', 'include', 'japan', 'south', 'korea', 'singapore', 'iata', 'december', 'outlook', 'industry', 'project', 'collective', 'revenue', 'rise', 'figure', 'include', 'nonpassenger', 'revenue', 'however', 'fall', 'oil', 'price', 'go', 'way', 'cushion', 'outbreak', 'impact', 'barrel', 'price', 'brent', 'crude', 'oil', 'fall', 'almost', 'start', 'around', 'level', 'iata', 'estimate', 'low', 'fuel', 'cost', 'though', 'note', 'significantly', 'cushion', 'devastate', 'impact', 'outbreak', 'travel', 'demand', 'flag', 'hedge', 'postpone', 'impact', 'many', 'iata', 'director', 'general', 'alexandre', 'de', 'juniac', 'say', 'turn', 'event', 'recent', 'day', 'almost', 'without', 'precedent', 'say', 'unclear', 'virus', 'develop', 'whether', 'see', 'impact', 'contain', 'market', 'revenue', 'loss', 'broader', 'impact', 'lead', 'loss', 'revenue', 'medium', 'briefing', 'held', 'twoday', 'industry', 'workshop', 'singapore', 'iata', 'chief', 'economist', 'brian', 'pearce', 'say', 'unclear', 'soon', 'industry', 'rebound', 'especially', 'give', 'cluster', 'transmission', 'occur', 'outside', 'epicentre', 'outbreak', 'see', 'later', 'recovery', 'europe', 'possible', 'sign', 'stabilisation', 'domestic', 'travel', 'early', 'tell', 'point', 'add', 'association', 'reiterates', 'call', 'relief', 'measure', 'mitigate', 'outbreak', 'impact', 'include', 'tax', 'relief', 'reduction', 'charge', 'well', 'temporary', 'ease', 'slot', 'allocation', 'rule', 'iata', 'late', 'assessment', 'come', 'day', 'release', 'data', 'passenger', 'traffic', 'growth', 'slow', 'january', 'weak', 'monthly', 'increase', 'nearly', 'revenue', 'passengerkilometres', 'latin', 'america', 'asiapacific', 'bad', 'hit', 'grow', 'europe', 'growth', 'figure', 'africa', 'middle', 'east', 'north', 'america', 'range', 'de', 'juniac', 'warn', 'january', 'data', 'tip', 'iceberg', 'term', 'impact', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'major', 'travel', 'restriction', 'kick', 'latejanuary', 'note']"
"Impact of the coronavirus outbreak sealed the fate of struggling UK regional carrier Flybe, shareholder Virgin Atlantic has claimed. Virgin Atlantic was one of three investors in the Connect Airways consortium which took over Flybe a little more than a year ago and intended to develop the airline as a feeder for long-haul services, under the Virgin Connect brand. But the company says it has been unable to turn the airline around despite efforts from its personnel and over £135 million of investment in the last 14 months. Virgin Atlantic says the emergence of the coronavirus has had a negative impact on Flybe's trading, and means the Connect Airways consortium “can no longer commit to continued financial support”. “We are deeply disappointed that Flybe has been unable to secure a viable basis for its continuing operations,” it adds, following the regional operator's filing for administration. Flybe had been under financial pressure for considerable time, and Connect Airways was formed to prevent the airline's collapse. Virgin Atlantic teamed with Stobart Group and Cyrus Capital Partners to take over the carrier. But the consortium faced a potential Flybe collapse earlier this year, forcing the shareholders to negotiate a controversial agreement with the government in January – deferring payment of air passenger duty – to keep the airline operating. Virgin Atlantic says the consortium has since invested £25 million of £30 million committed in January, while the “time to pay” arrangement with the UK treasury for the air passenger duty provided another £3.8 million. “As a priority we are looking at options to provide support to Flybe staff and to assist affected customers,” states Virgin. All Flybe flights, including those operated by Stobart Air, have been cancelled as a result of the entry into administration, says the UK Civil Aviation Authority. “We know that Flybe's decision to stop trading will be very distressing for all of its employees and customers,” says CAA chief Richard Moriarty. Some customers could be protected if they had booked services with a credit card, or purchased scheduled airline failure insurance. Others could be protected if they booked a flight under a travel company which holds an Air Travel Organiser's Licence – but the CAA warns that it believes “very few” Flybe passengers are ATOL-protected. There is no government directive to repatriate Flybe passengers through special flights, says the CAA, because there is “capacity in the market” for them to secure alternative travel by air, rail or coach. Stobart Group holds a 30% share of Connect Airways. It contributed its regional airline operation Stobart Air and leasing division Propius to the consortium, as part of its investment, but says Stobart Air's ability to trade is not directly affected by the collapse of Flybe. It is, however, writing down to zero its investment Connect Airways, including a contribution of £43.3 million plus a £7 million investment made earlier this year. Stobart Group adds that it has “foregone” deferred interest from which it would have benefited in the future. But it points out that Stobart Air is not wholly-owned by Connect Airways – while Connect controls 40% of the carrier, the balance is held by an employee trust. “As such Stobart Air's ongoing ability to trade is not directly impacted by the decision to place [Flybe] into administration,” it says. Stobart Group is the operator of London Southend airport and says the facility will experience a “short-term impact” given Flybe's plans to operate several routes from Southend this year. But it adds that the longer-term prospects for Southend “remain compelling”.",3,576,8.0,0.4598,"government, uk, carrier, business, state, share, south, airway, financial, plan","['impact', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'seal', 'fate', 'struggle', 'uk', 'regional', 'carrier', 'flybe', 'shareholder', 'virgin', 'atlantic', 'claimed', 'virgin', 'atlantic', 'investor', 'connect', 'airway', 'consortium', 'take', 'flybe', 'little', 'ago', 'intend', 'develop', 'feeder', 'longhaul', 'service', 'virgin', 'connect', 'brand', 'say', 'unable', 'turn', 'around', 'despite', 'effort', 'personnel', 'investment', 'month', 'virgin', 'atlantic', 'say', 'emergence', 'coronavirus', 'negative', 'impact', 'flybe', 'trading', 'mean', 'connect', 'airway', 'consortium', 'longer', 'commit', 'continued', 'financial', 'support', 'deeply', 'disappointed', 'flybe', 'unable', 'secure', 'viable', 'basis', 'continue', 'operation', 'add', 'follow', 'regional', 'operator', 'filing', 'administration', 'flybe', 'financial', 'pressure', 'considerable', 'connect', 'airway', 'form', 'prevent', 'collapse', 'virgin', 'atlantic', 'team', 'stobart', 'cyrus', 'capital', 'partner', 'take', 'carrier', 'consortium', 'face', 'potential', 'flybe', 'collapse', 'earlier', 'force', 'shareholder', 'negotiate', 'controversial', 'agreement', 'government', 'january', 'defer', 'payment', 'passenger', 'duty', 'keep', 'operating', 'virgin', 'atlantic', 'say', 'consortium', 'since', 'invest', 'commit', 'january', 'pay', 'arrangement', 'uk', 'treasury', 'passenger', 'duty', 'provide', 'another', 'priority', 'look', 'option', 'provide', 'support', 'flybe', 'staff', 'assist', 'affected', 'customer', 'state', 'virgin', 'flybe', 'include', 'operate', 'stobart', 'cancel', 'result', 'entry', 'administration', 'say', 'uk', 'civil', 'authority', 'know', 'flybe', 'decision', 'stop', 'trading', 'distress', 'employee', 'customer', 'say', 'caa', 'chief', 'richard', 'moriarty', 'customer', 'protect', 'book', 'service', 'credit', 'card', 'purchase', 'schedule', 'failure', 'insurance', 'others', 'protect', 'book', 'travel', 'hold', 'travel', 'organiser', 'licence', 'caa', 'warns', 'believe', 'flybe', 'passenger', 'atolprotected', 'government', 'directive', 'repatriate', 'flybe', 'passenger', 'special', 'say', 'caa', 'capacity', 'market', 'secure', 'alternative', 'travel', 'rail', 'coach', 'stobart', 'hold', 'share', 'connect', 'airway', 'contribute', 'regional', 'operation', 'stobart', 'lease', 'division', 'propius', 'consortium', 'part', 'investment', 'say', 'stobart', 'ability', 'trade', 'directly', 'affected', 'collapse', 'flybe', 'however', 'write', 'zero', 'investment', 'connect', 'airway', 'include', 'contribution', 'plus', 'investment', 'make', 'earlier', 'stobart', 'add', 'foregone', 'defer', 'interest', 'benefit', 'future', 'point', 'stobart', 'whollyowned', 'connect', 'airway', 'connect', 'control', 'carrier', 'balance', 'held', 'employee', 'trust', 'stobart', 'ongoing', 'ability', 'trade', 'directly', 'impact', 'decision', 'place', 'flybe', 'administration', 'say', 'stobart', 'operator', 'london', 'southend', 'airport', 'say', 'facility', 'experience', 'shortterm', 'impact', 'give', 'flybe', 'plan', 'operate', 'several', 'route', 'southend', 'add', 'longerterm', 'prospect', 'southend', 'remain', 'compelling']"

The latest news came hours after media reports in the UK suggested the carrier was to file for administration after completing its last flights on 4 March. The UK government had rejected Flybe's request for a £100 million ($129 million) loan, reports indicate. Meanwhile, financial pressure had increased on the carrier in recent days as air travel demand was impacted by the coronavirus outbreak. The carrier appeared to be on the brink of going under in January, before a deal brokered with the UK government prompted investors to pump fresh, limited funding to the struggling carrier. Following Flybe's collapse, two of its franchise partners, Eastern Airways and Blue Islands, have said their services will continue to operate. In a post on its official Twitter account, Eastern says its services were unaffected. All passengers who have booked Flybe flights operated by Eastern for the rest of the week should “turn up and travel as normal”, it adds.  A notice on Blue Islands' website states: “Blue Islands services will continue to operate as normal, following the closure of Flybe.” Meanwhile, the UK Civil Aviation Authority has weighed in on the collapse, calling it a “sad day” for UK aviation. It urged customers to make their own alternative travel arrangements in light of Flybe's collapse.  The UK Department for Transport, meanwhile, adds that it is working with the airline industry to “minimise any disruption to routes operated by Flybe, including by looking urgently at how routes not already covered by other airlines can be re-established by the industry”. “Through the reviews of regional connectivity and airport passenger duty we have announced, we will bring forward recommendations to help ensure that the whole of the UK has the connections in place that people rely on,” the department adds. Exeter-based Flybe had been planning to rebrand as Virgin Connect, operating as a feeder service for Virgin Atlantic long-haul flights. Flybe assets were acquired in early 2019 by the Connect consortium, comprising Virgin Atlantic, Stobart Group and Cyrus Capital. While the cut-price deal was announced in January 2019, the consortium did not receive European Commission clearance for the acquisition until July 2019. The delay, coupled with other factors, impacted the delivery of the consortium's turnaround plan – reportedly to the tune of £9 million – for Flybe. Flybe, which was established as Jersey European Airways and later became British European, operates a fleet of over 60 Bombardier Q400 turboprops and Embraer E-Jets.

"Hong Kong's Air Accident Investigation Authority is investigating an incident where an Etihad Boeing 787-9 deviated from the localiser course while landing. The incident occurred on 7 September, 2019 at around 10:41 local time. The twinjet, registered A6-BLF (MSN 39651), was operating flight 834 from Abu Dhabi to Hong Kong, carrying 168 passengers and 11 crew members. The aircraft was conducting an ILS approach into Hong Kong International Airport when it deviated from the localiser course. It attempted to establish the localiser on Runway 25R after turning left. At around 15nm from the runway, the aircraft began deviating to the right of the localiser and descended below the minimum sector altitude of 4,300 ft. Investigators note that the aircraft subsequently established the localiser course at about 11nm from the runway. The aircraft then landed without further incident or damage. The authority has classified the incident as serious and will conduct a detailed analysis of the data and information collected. It anticipates investigations to take up to 12 months.

"IATA data shows that passenger traffic growth slowed to 2.4% in January – the weakest monthly increase since April 2010, and a sharp decrease from December 2019's 4.6% rise in revenue passenger-kilometres. “January was just the tip of the iceberg in terms of the traffic impacts we are seeing owing to the Covid-19 outbreak, given that major travel restrictions in China did not begin until 23 January,” warns IATA director general Alexandre de Juniac. “Nevertheless, it was still enough to cause our slowest traffic growth in nearly a decade.” Worst-hit among the regions were Latin America and Asia-Pacific, which each saw RPKs grow just 0.4% in January. Europe showed growth by 1.6%, while the figures for Africa, the Middle East and North America were in the 5-6% range. Capacity as measured by available seat-kilometres was raised 1.7%.

"Troubled UK regional carrier Flybe is widely reported to be set to cease operations and file for administration. Widespread media reports in the UK earlier on 4 March suggested Flybe would announce it is filing for administration after completing its last flights. The airline appeared on the brink of collapse in January, before a deal brokered with the UK government prompted investors to provide further limited funding for the airline. Reports surfaced today that the government had rejected its request for a £100 million loan, while financial pressure had increased on the carrier in recent days as air travel demand was impacted by the coronavirus outbreak. There remains no formal announcement from Flybe, but the airline's website has been showing an error message since 23:00 on 4 March, while images circulating on social media show notifications from the operators of Glasgow and Aberdeen airports to impound Flybe aircraft.  A statement on the Blue Islands website, a Flybe franchise partner, says its services ”will continue to operate, following the closure of Flybe”. Another Flybe franchise partner, Eastern Airways, also advised passenger to arrive as normal in the coming days following the closure of Flybe. UK cockpit union BALPA has prepared a statement mentioning that Flybe has “ceased trading”, although this appears to have pre-empted a public confirmation from the carrier. In the statement BALPA points out that the UK government had “promised a rescue package” for the airline – acquired by a Virgin Atlantic consortium about a year ago – after it faced financial problems earlier this year. “Flybe staff will feel disgusted at this betrayal and these broken promises,” says BALPA general secretary Brian Strutton. Nadine Houghton, a national officer at the GMB union, says: ”These unfolding developments are a tragedy not only for Flybe's loyal workforce, but a domino effect now puts 1,400 jobs in the wider supply chain at immediate risk and threatens the future of vital regional airports.” The airline had been planning to rebrand as Virgin Connect, operating as a feeder service for Virgin Atlantic long-haul flights. Flybe assets were acquired in early 2019 by the Connect consortium, comprising Virgin Atlantic, Stobart Group and Cyrus Capital. But while the cut-price deal was announced in January 2019, the consortium did not receive European Commission clearance for the acquisition until July 2019. ”The delay in receiving control, coupled with a number of other factors including legacy issues, impacted on the delivery of the consortium's turnaround plan for Flybe,” Stobart said, when in January it confirmed it was an investing an additional up to £9 million in the airline to keep it flying. Exeter-based regional Flybe, which was established as Jersey European Airways and later became British European, operates a fleet of over 60 Bombardier Q400 turboprops and Embraer E-Jets. The carrier had reported an operating profit only once during the last decade.

"United Airlines has slashed its North American flight schedules 10% starting this spring, implemented a hiring freeze, offered staff unpaid leave and postponed some salary increases – all in response to sagging demand from the ongoing coronavirus outbreak. The airline disclosed the measures in a 4 March memo to employees that outlines the Chicago-based carrier's virus response efforts. The memo leaves no doubt the coronavirus outbreak has finally hit US carriers domestically – a segment of the market the industry had hoped might be shielded from an outbreak that more-significantly affected other countries, but that continues spreading globally. The 10% North American schedule reduction applies to United's US and Canada flights. It takes effect in April, though the carrier has “already begun planning similar reductions in May”, says the memo, signed by United chief executive Oscar Munoz and president Scott Kirby. United's memo also says the airline shaved 20% off its international schedule in April, with similar cuts expected for May. The carrier has already cut flights to several Asia destinations and suspended service to Shanghai, Beijing, Chengdu and Hong Kong. “The decline in our international bookings, combined with lower demand among US travellers, requires significant changes to our domestic schedule,” says the memo. The schedule reductions are “being implemented in a way that minimises the impact on our employees and our operation”. “For example, we're reducing the number of frequencies per week, finding routes with alternative travel options via other United hubs and delaying start dates for seasonal travel to certain destinations – without closing any domestic stations,” it says. “We sincerely hope that these latest measures are enough, but the dynamic nature of this outbreak requires us to be nimble and flexible moving forward,” it adds. United did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the capacity cuts. No other US carriers have announced coronavirus-related domestic schedule reductions. ”We are continuing to closely monitor the situation and will make any updates as necessary,” says American Airlines. United has also immediately given all US-based employees “the option to apply for a voluntary, unpaid leave of absence. It has suspended “all new hiring” (critical positions excluded) through at least 30 June and is considering postponing new-hire training classes. United has also delayed from 1 April to 1 July its “2019 merit salary increases for all management and administrative employees”, the memo says. Unionised staff will continue receiving contract-specified raises. Also on 4 March, the Air Line Pilots Association, International (ALPA) issued a memo making United's member pilots aware of the company's “extraordinary actions during this rapidly changing situation”. The memo mentions “operational route and scheduling changes affecting the short-term manpower planning”. It says more information will not be available until 8 March, “following a network re-optimisation and review process”. “Several widebody aircraft have been redeployed domestically on hub-to-hub, [transcontinental routes] and to spring break destinations,” ALPA's memo says. The news comes the same day Munoz and other airline executives discussed the virus with President Donald Trump during a meeting in Washington. Executives urged Trump to help calm travellers' concerns, with Munoz stressing the importance that officials continue “to project stability”.",3,581,5.0,0.3191,"carrier, march, international, outbreak, suspend, capacity, schedule, april, united, coronavirus","['united', 'slash', 'north', 'american', 'schedule', 'start', 'spring', 'implement', 'hire', 'freeze', 'offer', 'staff', 'unpaid', 'leave', 'postpone', 'salary', 'increase', 'response', 'sag', 'demand', 'ongoing', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'disclose', 'measure', 'march', 'memo', 'employee', 'outline', 'chicagobased', 'carrier', 'virus', 'response', 'effort', 'memo', 'leaf', 'doubt', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'finally', 'hit', 'u', 'carrier', 'domestically', 'segment', 'market', 'industry', 'hop', 'might', 'shield', 'outbreak', 'moresignificantly', 'affected', 'country', 'continue', 'spread', 'globally', 'north', 'american', 'schedule', 'reduction', 'applies', 'united', 'u', 'canada', 'take', 'effect', 'april', 'though', 'carrier', 'already', 'begin', 'planning', 'similar', 'reduction', 'may', 'say', 'memo', 'sign', 'united', 'chief', 'executive', 'oscar', 'munoz', 'president', 'scott', 'kirby', 'united', 'memo', 'say', 'shave', 'international', 'schedule', 'april', 'similar', 'cut', 'expect', 'may', 'carrier', 'already', 'cut', 'several', 'asia', 'destination', 'suspend', 'service', 'shanghai', 'beijing', 'chengdu', 'hong', 'kong', 'decline', 'international', 'booking', 'combine', 'low', 'demand', 'among', 'u', 'traveller', 'require', 'significant', 'change', 'domestic', 'schedule', 'say', 'memo', 'schedule', 'reduction', 'implement', 'way', 'minimises', 'impact', 'employee', 'operation', 'example', 'reduce', 'number', 'frequency', 'per', 'week', 'find', 'route', 'alternative', 'travel', 'option', 'via', 'united', 'hub', 'delay', 'start', 'date', 'seasonal', 'travel', 'certain', 'destination', 'without', 'closing', 'domestic', 'station', 'say', 'sincerely', 'hope', 'late', 'measure', 'enough', 'dynamic', 'nature', 'outbreak', 'require', 'u', 'nimble', 'flexible', 'move', 'forward', 'add', 'united', 'immediately', 'respond', 'request', 'detail', 'capacity', 'cut', 'u', 'carrier', 'announce', 'coronavirusrelated', 'domestic', 'schedule', 'reduction', 'continue', 'closely', 'monitor', 'situation', 'make', 'update', 'necessary', 'say', 'american', 'united', 'immediately', 'give', 'usbased', 'employee', 'option', 'apply', 'voluntary', 'unpaid', 'leave', 'absence', 'suspend', 'hire', 'critical', 'position', 'exclude', 'least', 'june', 'consider', 'postpone', 'newhire', 'training', 'class', 'united', 'delayed', 'april', 'july', 'merit', 'salary', 'increase', 'management', 'administrative', 'employee', 'memo', 'say', 'unionised', 'staff', 'continue', 'receive', 'contractspecified', 'raise', 'march', 'line', 'pilot', 'association', 'international', 'alpa', 'issue', 'memo', 'make', 'united', 'member', 'pilot', 'aware', 'extraordinary', 'action', 'rapidly', 'change', 'situation', 'memo', 'mention', 'operational', 'route', 'schedule', 'change', 'affect', 'shortterm', 'manpower', 'planning', 'say', 'information', 'available', 'march', 'follow', 'network', 'reoptimisation', 'review', 'process', 'several', 'widebody', 'redeployed', 'domestically', 'hubtohub', 'transcontinental', 'route', 'spring', 'break', 'destination', 'alpa', 'memo', 'say', 'news', 'come', 'day', 'munoz', 'executive', 'discuss', 'virus', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'meeting', 'washington', 'executive', 'urge', 'trump', 'help', 'calm', 'traveller', 'concern', 'munoz', 'stress', 'importance', 'official', 'continue', 'project', 'stability']"
"Investigators have given greater insight into the initial altitude deviation by a descending Boeing 747-400 freighter which preceded the aircraft's capturing a false glideslope and fatally crashing at Bishkek. The inquiry into the accident, at night on 16 January 2017, had already established that the aircraft had been too high on its approach, leaving it susceptible to encountering the false glideslope. But it had not explained why the ACT Airlines aircraft had remained so high after leaving its cruise altitude and commencing its descent towards the Kyrgyz capital. The aircraft had been maintaining 18,000ft over the waypoint RAXAT, and was cleared to descend to 6,000ft to cross TOPKA. These two waypoints were just 27nm apart and the airline's standard descent procedure would only have enabled the 747 to lose 9,000ft rather than the required 12,000ft in such a short distance. “They left us high again,” the captain remarked, one of several comments indicating the crew had been hoping for earlier clearances to a lower altitude. The aircraft was operating in 'flight level change' mode and the crew selected 6,000ft with an airspeed of 262kt. Despite the requirement for a more aggressive loss of altitude, the inquiry says the initial descent was conducted without the use of speedbrakes, and with increasing airspeed – the airspeed was adjusted to 270kt, then to 280kt, and again to 290kt as the aircraft passed through cloud at 16,000ft. Some 1min 40s into the descent the crew changed to 'vertical speed' mode and increased the descent rate to 2,400ft/min. The airspeed continued to rise, reaching a maximum of 317kt. Speedbrakes were deployed manually at 12,200ft – initially to 30° and then to 36° – and the 'flight level change' mode was re-engaged. The aircraft continued to descend but reached only 9,200ft by the time it passed TOPKA. It was also travelling at 270kt, above the 250kt limit dictated by ACT for flight below 10,000ft. “The chart requirements [for passing TOPKA] were not formally violated,” says the inquiry. “But the aircraft was too high for continuing the approach in accordance with the chart without additional manoeuvring for decreasing the altitude.” None of the four crew survived the accident which also resulted in 35 ground fatalities Investigators sought further analysis of the aircraft's flightpath from an airline operating 747s, concluding that – given the short distance in which to lose altitude – the absence of speedbrake deployment at the beginning of the descent was “incorrect”. To descend from 18,000ft at RAXAT and reach 6,000ft by TOPKA the speedbrakes should have been extended from the outset, the inquiry says, and the “significant increase” in airspeed “should have been prevented”. It adds that the crew also ought to have extended the landing-gear some 5-8nm before TOPKA, and deployed 5° of flap while keeping the speedbrakes extended, and reduced airspeed to 210kt in order to achieve a steeper descent. The aircraft remained above the approach profile as it neared Bishkek and inadvertently captured a false 9° glideslope from the ILS to runway 26. Owing to the 747's excessive altitude, it automatically followed a descent path that took it over the airport and it landed beyond the runway in a residential area, resulting in the loss of all four crew members as well as 35 fatalities on the ground.",3,582,7.0,0.5992,"crew, runway, inquiry, land, approach, accident, investigator, captain, incident, pilot","['investigator', 'give', 'great', 'insight', 'initial', 'altitude', 'deviation', 'descend', 'freighter', 'precede', 'capture', 'false', 'glideslope', 'fatally', 'crash', 'bishkek', 'inquiry', 'accident', 'night', 'january', 'already', 'establish', 'high', 'approach', 'leave', 'susceptible', 'encounter', 'false', 'glideslope', 'explain', 'act', 'remain', 'high', 'leave', 'cruise', 'altitude', 'commence', 'descent', 'towards', 'kyrgyz', 'capital', 'maintain', 'waypoint', 'raxat', 'clear', 'descend', 'cross', 'topka', 'waypoints', 'apart', 'standard', 'descent', 'procedure', 'enable', 'lose', 'rather', 'require', 'short', 'distance', 'left', 'u', 'high', 'captain', 'remark', 'several', 'comment', 'indicate', 'crew', 'hop', 'earlier', 'clearance', 'low', 'altitude', 'operating', 'level', 'change', 'mode', 'crew', 'select', 'airspeed', 'despite', 'requirement', 'aggressive', 'loss', 'altitude', 'inquiry', 'say', 'initial', 'descent', 'conduct', 'without', 'use', 'speedbrakes', 'increase', 'airspeed', 'airspeed', 'adjust', 'pass', 'cloud', 'descent', 'crew', 'change', 'speed', 'mode', 'increase', 'descent', 'rate', 'airspeed', 'continued', 'rise', 'reach', 'maximum', 'speedbrakes', 'deployed', 'manually', 'initially', 'level', 'change', 'mode', 'reengaged', 'continued', 'descend', 'reach', 'pass', 'topka', 'travel', 'limit', 'dictate', 'act', 'chart', 'requirement', 'passing', 'topka', 'formally', 'violate', 'say', 'inquiry', 'high', 'continue', 'approach', 'accordance', 'chart', 'without', 'additional', 'manoeuvre', 'decrease', 'none', 'crew', 'survive', 'accident', 'result', 'ground', 'fatality', 'investigator', 'sought', 'far', 'analysis', 'flightpath', 'operating', 'conclude', 'give', 'short', 'distance', 'lose', 'altitude', 'absence', 'speedbrake', 'deployment', 'begin', 'descent', 'incorrect', 'descend', 'raxat', 'reach', 'topka', 'speedbrakes', 'extend', 'outset', 'inquiry', 'say', 'significant', 'increase', 'airspeed', 'prevent', 'add', 'crew', 'ought', 'extend', 'landinggear', 'topka', 'deployed', 'flap', 'keep', 'speedbrakes', 'extend', 'reduce', 'airspeed', 'order', 'achieve', 'steeper', 'descent', 'remain', 'approach', 'profile', 'near', 'bishkek', 'inadvertently', 'capture', 'false', 'glideslope', 'il', 'runway', 'owe', 'excessive', 'altitude', 'automatically', 'follow', 'descent', 'path', 'take', 'airport', 'land', 'beyond', 'runway', 'residential', 'area', 'result', 'loss', 'crew', 'member', 'well', 'fatality', 'ground']"

"China has detailed plans for a funding scheme aimed at incentivising airlines to continue or restore services in the light of the heavy network cuts amid the coronavirus outbreak. In a notice issued today, the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) outlined an initiative to provide support for domestic and foreign carriers to retain or resume international services to mainland China. The reward scheme is split into a CNY0.0176 ($0.0025) per seat kilometre reward for flights on routes served by multiple airlines, and a CNY0.0528 reward per seat kilometre for a route where the carrier is a sole operator. The policy implementation period covers 23 January to 30 June. International services to and from mainland China have been heavily reduced since the outbreak emerged in Wuhan during January. Many international carriers began suspending services to mainland China in late January and have since suspended flights through February and March, with several pushing these suspensions into April. Chinese carriers too have been forced to suspend or reduce services on their international networks. Figures released by IATA today for January show global traffic growth of 2.4% compared with the same month in 2019 – which marked the slowest monthly rate of passenger growth since the volcanic ash cloud in April 2010. “January was just the tip of the iceberg in terms of the traffic impacts we are seeing owing to the Covid-19 outbreak, given that major travel restrictions in China did not begin until 23 January,” says IATA director general Alexandre de Juniac. ”Nevertheless, it was still enough to cause our slowest traffic growth in nearly a decade.” Notably, IATA reports Chinese airliness' domestic traffic fell 6.8% in January, reflecting the impact of flight cancellations and travel restrictions related to the coronavirus outbreak. As capacity was only cut 0.2%, passenger load factor on Chinese domestic routes plunged more than five percentage points to 76.7%.",3,584,5.0,0.2733,"carrier, march, international, outbreak, suspend, capacity, schedule, april, united, coronavirus","['detailed', 'plan', 'funding', 'scheme', 'aim', 'incentivising', 'continue', 'restore', 'service', 'light', 'heavy', 'network', 'cut', 'amid', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'notice', 'issue', 'today', 'civil', 'administration', 'caac', 'outline', 'initiative', 'provide', 'support', 'domestic', 'foreign', 'carrier', 'retain', 'resume', 'international', 'service', 'mainland', 'reward', 'scheme', 'split', 'per', 'seat', 'kilometre', 'reward', 'route', 'serve', 'multiple', 'reward', 'per', 'seat', 'kilometre', 'route', 'carrier', 'sole', 'operator', 'policy', 'implementation', 'period', 'cover', 'january', 'june', 'international', 'service', 'mainland', 'heavily', 'reduce', 'since', 'outbreak', 'emerge', 'wuhan', 'january', 'many', 'international', 'carrier', 'begin', 'suspend', 'service', 'mainland', 'late', 'january', 'since', 'suspend', 'february', 'march', 'several', 'push', 'suspension', 'april', 'chinese', 'carrier', 'force', 'suspend', 'reduce', 'service', 'international', 'network', 'figure', 'release', 'iata', 'today', 'january', 'global', 'traffic', 'growth', 'compare', 'month', 'marked', 'slowest', 'monthly', 'rate', 'passenger', 'growth', 'since', 'volcanic', 'ash', 'cloud', 'april', 'january', 'tip', 'iceberg', 'term', 'traffic', 'impact', 'see', 'owe', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'give', 'major', 'travel', 'restriction', 'begin', 'january', 'say', 'iata', 'director', 'general', 'alexandre', 'de', 'juniac', 'nevertheless', 'still', 'enough', 'cause', 'slowest', 'traffic', 'growth', 'nearly', 'notably', 'iata', 'report', 'chinese', 'domestic', 'traffic', 'fell', 'january', 'reflect', 'impact', 'cancellation', 'travel', 'restriction', 'related', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'capacity', 'cut', 'passenger', 'load', 'factor', 'chinese', 'domestic', 'route', 'plunge', 'percentage', 'point']"
"Middle Eastern carrier Flydubai is looking to extend leases on aircraft which had been due to leave the fleet next year, to help cope with the capacity problems arising from continued grounding of the Boeing 737 Max. Flydubai has 14 Max jets. It says the airline's fleet of 42 737-800s leaves it “severely impeded” in terms of opening new routes or raising frequencies. It has supplemented its fleet with three 737s leased from Smartwings. “We are currently exploring options to extend the term for the lease of aircraft that were due to leave our fleet in 2021,” says Flydubai. While the carrier managed to return to profit last year, the 737 Max problems have “significantly impacted” its growth strategy, says chief executive Ghaith Al Ghaith, and the financial results do not reflect the “loss of market position” and the “unfilled opportunities” the airline could have taken. Flydubai has unveiled a profit of Dhs198 million ($54 million) for the full year to 31 December 2019, despite a 2.6% fall in revenues to Dhs6 billion. Falling prices helped keep fuel expenditure below 26% of operating costs, but the airline points out that it was unable to take advantage of the efficiency expected from 737 Max operations. Al Ghaith says the company has benefited from an interim settlement with Boeing – which remains confidential – for “certain compensation” for the 737 Max situation. “This agreement has contributed towards this year's results,” he acknowledges. “But in no way can it compensate for the loss of business opportunity or market share experienced by the airline. “Discussions are continuing between the parties regarding the ongoing impact of the grounding.”",3,585,2.0,0.217,"executive, chief, cut, add, situation, staff, crisis, make, coronavirus, employee","['middle', 'eastern', 'carrier', 'flydubai', 'look', 'extend', 'lease', 'due', 'leave', 'fleet', 'next', 'help', 'cope', 'capacity', 'problem', 'arise', 'continued', 'ground', 'flydubai', 'jet', 'say', 'fleet', 'leaf', 'severely', 'impede', 'term', 'opening', 'route', 'raise', 'frequency', 'supplement', 'fleet', 'lease', 'smartwings', 'currently', 'explore', 'option', 'extend', 'term', 'lease', 'due', 'leave', 'fleet', 'say', 'flydubai', 'carrier', 'manage', 'return', 'profit', 'problem', 'significantly', 'impact', 'growth', 'strategy', 'say', 'chief', 'executive', 'ghaith', 'al', 'ghaith', 'financial', 'result', 'reflect', 'loss', 'market', 'position', 'unfilled', 'opportunity', 'take', 'flydubai', 'unveiled', 'profit', 'full', 'december', 'despite', 'fall', 'revenue', 'fall', 'price', 'help', 'keep', 'fuel', 'expenditure', 'operating', 'cost', 'point', 'unable', 'take', 'advantage', 'efficiency', 'expect', 'operation', 'al', 'ghaith', 'say', 'benefit', 'interim', 'settlement', 'remains', 'confidential', 'certain', 'compensation', 'situation', 'agreement', 'contribute', 'towards', 'result', 'acknowledges', 'way', 'compensate', 'loss', 'business', 'opportunity', 'market', 'share', 'experienced', 'discussion', 'continue', 'party', 'regard', 'ongoing', 'impact', 'ground']"
"IATA is warning that “tough times are ahead” after cargo tonne-kilometres declined 3.3% in January. “January marked the 10th consecutive month of year-on-year declines in cargo volumes,” the airline association notes. “The air cargo industry started the year on a weak footing.” Initial optimism that easing US-China trade tensions could provide a boost to the sector has been dispelled by disruption to global supply chains from the coronavirus, notes IATA director general Alexandre de Juniac, though the outbreak did not have much of an impact on the January figures. However, he adds that while “the course of future events is unclear”, the sector “has proven its resilience time and again”. Cargo capacity was raised 0.9% in January. Among the regions, Asia-Pacific saw the greatest drop in demand, of 5.9%. “The impact from Covid-19 is expected to affect February's performance,” says IATA.

"Finnair and central European budget carrier Wizz Air have become the latest European carriers to detail more plans for cuts in response to the coronavirus outbreak. The Finnish carrier has extended its suspension of Chinese mainland services to the end of April and has opened talks with unions over potential temporary layoffs. Wizz meanwhile is considering cutting 10% of its capacity across the three months from April to June. Finnair had already suspended services to six mainland China destinations and reduced frequency on Hong Kong flights until the end of the winter season on 28 March. It has now extended these measures until the end of April. But it also making cuts to other countries where there have been spikes in reported cases of the virus. It is suspending its daily flights to Seoul until 16 April and has pushed back the launch of flights to another Korean city, Busan, from the original 31 March start date to 1 July. Finnair is also cutting flights to Milan until 7 April following an updated travel advisory from the Finnish foreign ministry concerning the Italian city. As a result of the cuts, the Oneworld carrier is opening negotiations on planned temporary lay-offs affecting the entire Finnair personnel based in Finland. ”According to the current estimate, the possible lay-offs would be implemented so that all employees within the co-operations process would be temporarily laid off for a 14-30 day period,” it says. Talks are expected to last two weeks. Similar personnel measures will also be taken in countries outside Finland. Meanwhile in a stock market update issued ahead of its financial results for the year ending 31 March 2020, Wizz Air today said it is considering further cutting its network by around 10% for the quarter ending 30 June. Wizz has already reduced services on its network for the period from 11 March to 2 April, in particular cutting its Italian capacity by around 60%. “Subject to further impact on demand from Covid-19, we are considering further adjusting network capacity in the magnitude of 10% in quarter one [for the financial year 2021],” it says. ”At this point in time it is difficult to predict the extent and the duration of the outbreak and the impact on the next financial year, however we remain confident that as the situation normalises, Wizz Air will continue its highly successful trajectory.” ",3,587,5.0,0.2445,"carrier, march, international, outbreak, suspend, capacity, schedule, april, united, coronavirus","['finnair', 'central', 'european', 'budget', 'carrier', 'wizz', 'become', 'late', 'european', 'carrier', 'detail', 'plan', 'cut', 'response', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'finnish', 'carrier', 'extend', 'suspension', 'chinese', 'mainland', 'service', 'end', 'april', 'open', 'talk', 'union', 'potential', 'temporary', 'layoff', 'wizz', 'meanwhile', 'consider', 'cut', 'capacity', 'across', 'month', 'april', 'june', 'finnair', 'already', 'suspend', 'service', 'mainland', 'destination', 'reduce', 'frequency', 'hong', 'kong', 'end', 'winter', 'season', 'march', 'extend', 'measure', 'end', 'april', 'make', 'cut', 'country', 'spike', 'report', 'case', 'virus', 'suspend', 'daily', 'seoul', 'april', 'push', 'back', 'launch', 'another', 'korean', 'city', 'busan', 'original', 'march', 'start', 'date', 'july', 'finnair', 'cut', 'milan', 'april', 'follow', 'update', 'travel', 'advisory', 'finnish', 'foreign', 'ministry', 'concern', 'italian', 'city', 'result', 'cut', 'oneworld', 'carrier', 'opening', 'negotiation', 'plan', 'temporary', 'layoff', 'affect', 'entire', 'finnair', 'personnel', 'base', 'finland', 'accord', 'current', 'estimate', 'possible', 'layoff', 'implement', 'employee', 'within', 'cooperation', 'process', 'temporarily', 'laid', 'day', 'period', 'say', 'talk', 'expect', 'week', 'similar', 'personnel', 'measure', 'take', 'country', 'outside', 'finland', 'meanwhile', 'stock', 'market', 'update', 'issue', 'ahead', 'financial', 'result', 'end', 'march', 'wizz', 'today', 'say', 'consider', 'far', 'cut', 'network', 'around', 'quarter', 'end', 'june', 'wizz', 'already', 'reduce', 'service', 'network', 'period', 'march', 'april', 'particular', 'cut', 'italian', 'capacity', 'around', 'subject', 'far', 'impact', 'demand', 'coronavirus', 'consider', 'far', 'adjust', 'network', 'capacity', 'magnitude', 'quarter', 'financial', 'say', 'point', 'difficult', 'predict', 'extent', 'duration', 'outbreak', 'impact', 'next', 'financial', 'however', 'remain', 'confident', 'situation', 'normalises', 'wizz', 'continue', 'highly', 'successful', 'trajectory']"
"Airbus chief commercial officer Christian Scherer is uncertain whether the air transport impact from the coronavirus outbreak will translate into an effect on the airframer. Speaking during the A4E aviation summit in Brussels, Scherer pointed out that the aircraft manufacturing business “operates to longer cycles”. “It's too early to say if there'll be a ripple effect onto the industrial side,” he says. Scherer notes that the airline representatives at the summit were optimistic of a relatively quick rebound. “History tell us the resilience is there,” he adds, pointing to the outbreak of the SARS virus around 2003. “I don't think we have the answer yet.” At the peak of the SARS crisis, in the second quarter of 2003, Airbus senior executives had publicly insisted that the air transport system was being badly affected by heightened publicity that served to exaggerate the overall seriousness of the situation. SARS was a more lethal illness than coronavirus but Airbus's then-chief Noel Forgeard said in April 2003 that, nevertheless, the problem was being “extremely overstated by the media”. Airbus's then sales head John Leahy – whose role is now occupied by Scherer – had believed the SARS impact would be “relatively short-term”.

"New travel restrictions to limit the spread of the coronavirus take effect in Singapore today, barring the entry of new visitors who visited South Korea, Iran, or northern Italy in the past 14 days. Citizens and permanent residents returning from these regions will have to self-quarantine for 14 days.  “In view of the surge in the number of confirmed cases around the world – in particular in Iran, northern Italy, Japan, and Republic of Korea – the multi-ministry taskforce [for handling the coronavirus outbreak] will put in place further precautionary measures to limit the risk that these affected regions may pose to Singapore,” the health ministry says in an advisory. The ministry adds: “In the days ahead, it is likely that we will see a surge of infected cases in countries around the world, including in America, Europe, the Middle East, and the rest of Asia. Singapore is a small, globally connected city-state, and we are faced with a higher risk of imported cases. As of 3 March, there are more than 93,000 confirmed cases globally, according to data compiled by the Centre for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University. Of these, over 80,000 are in mainland China, 5,328 in South Korea, 2,502 in Italy, and 2,336 in Iran. The latest measures do not extend to Japan, which reported 293 cases, though minister for national development, Lawrence Wong tells the media there will be an advisory on outgoing travel. He cautions that the next wave of coronavirus cases in Singapore could be of “an order of magnitude different from what we have been used to.” “Border controls are still useful at this stage of the epidemic, because we can still identify where the sources of risk are...But we have to be prepared that at some stage, the border controls alone will not be sufficient.” Singapore is a key regional hub connected to nearly 150 cities, according to Cirium schedules data.

"Lockheed Martin has delivered the 500th F-35 fighter, with the fleet also surpassing the 250,000 flight hour mark. The 500th example delivered is an F-35A that will serve with the Vermont Air National Guard, says Lockheed. An image of the jet shows it bears the registration number AF5343. The 500th F-35 delivered will go to the Vermont Air National Guard. Of the 500 aircraft delivered so far, 354 are F-35As, 108 are F-35Bs with short takeoff/vertical landing (STOVL) capability, and 38 are F-35Cs for US Navy carrier operations. The 250,000hr mark includes aircraft used by the USA and international customers for testing, training, and operations. “These milestones are a testament to the talent and dedication of the joint government, military and industry teams,” said Greg Ulmer, Lockheed Martin, Vice President and General Manager of the F-35 programme. “The F-35 is delivering an unprecedented 5th Generation combat capability to the warfighter at the cost of a 4th Generation legacy aircraft.” Though the programme is hitting its stride it still suffers from issues. In January, the Department of Defense's Office of the Director of Operational Test & Evaluation released a report to congress stating that the F-35 has 873 deficiencies. “Although the programme is working to fix deficiencies, new discoveries are still being made, resulting in only a minor decrease in the overall number of deficiencies,” said the report. The F-35's problems include 13 Category 1 deficiencies. Such problems “may cause death or severe injury; may cause loss or major damage to a weapon system; critically restricts the combat readiness capabilities of the using organisation; or results in a production line stoppage,” according to the US Air Force's (USAF) definition. The F-35's deficiencies are compounded by maintenance problems which hobbled the aircraft's mission capable rate below the DoD's goal of 80%.

"Ryanair group chief executive Michael O'Leary would be open to ordering Airbus A320s – provided the European manufacturer can come up with the right offer. “The A320 is a great aircraft,” he told Cirium at the A4E aviation summit in Brussels, although he stresses that so too is the Boeing 737 Max. “The Airbus aircraft are more expensive than the Boeing aircraft, so [A320 operator] Lauda makes less money than Ryanair does,” says O'Leary. “Also, there's more intense competition in Vienna. Ultimately, the difference is like that between the Toyota Corolla and the Volkswagen Golf – they both fulfil exactly the same function, the question is which can you buy cheaper.” O'Leary, who reveals that he “took a call” from Airbus last week, adds: “I would talk to Airbus and Boeing if the price was right and the slots came up.” Asked whether he expected Ryanair to have any Airbus aircraft in its fleet in 10 years' time, he responded: “I doubt it, but I think there's every chance we'll have Airbus aircraft in the Lauda fleet.” Ryanair has 50 Max jets on order, but deliveries have been delayed by the aircraft's grounding, forcing the airline to scale back its expansion plans. It will now not take delivery of its first Max until winter 2020.

"Leaders of some the largest airlines in Europe believe that the coronavirus will only have a limited impact on demand for air travel on the continent. Speaking at the A4E aviation summit in Brussels on 3 March, IAG's outgoing chief executive Willie Walsh acknowledged that the group had seen a significant reduction demand on travel in Asia, focused on China where it has cut back its routes. Until recently, it had only seen a small impact on demand in Europe, although that changed in late February when the virus began spreading rapidly in Italy, highlighting the “fast-moving” and “dynamic” nature of the outbreak. But he rejects the notion that the situation could be compared with the aftermath of 9/11 when passenger aircraft were grounded across the globe. “If [demand] follows the pattern [that was] seen in Asia, it will stabilise in the coming weeks,” says Walsh. IAG is meanwhile seeing large reductions in demand from a fall in business travellers as companies tighten up their foreign travel policies and large events are cancelled. Walsh also argues that the situation does not warrant any state aid, noting that several airlines were seeking government cash even before the coronavirus hit. Ryanair group chief executive Michael O'Leary says the budget carrier is seeing a reduction in leisure demand, but does not see the impact lasting beyond the summer – and perhaps may fade even earlier. Demand will fall for roughly three weeks and “then people will get bored with coronavirus”, he suggests. Ryanair is not currently seeing cancellations for the Easter break, and O'Leary expects May/June demand to be normal. “Bookings through summer are relatively robust,” he notes. Air France-KLM chief executive Ben Smith is similarly dismissive of the notion that the industry may face another downturn along the lines of that post-9/11, although he does assess the coronavirus outbreak's effects to be worse than SARS – something he partly attributes to the heightened profile of social media that is generating anxiety among travellers. While his airline group is seeing problems in Asia and in Europe, he notes that the virus's impact on traffic to African, South American and transatlantic destinations has been “muted”. He recalls that when he was with Air Canada during the SARS epidemic – and Toronto was the centre of that outbreak in North America – travel bounced back strongly once the situation was brought under control. “[Demand] was relatively quick [to return] once there was an understanding of the virus,” he says.

"IAG chief Willie Walsh is firmly rejecting any notion that airlines which were struggling before the coronavirus outbreak should be granted state aid to help cope with its impact. He told the A4E aviation summit in Brussels on 3 March that the outbreak was “not an excuse” for such carriers to ask for state assistance.  Walsh speaking at A4E Aviation Summit 2020 “I don't believe it's appropriate for governments to provide financial support to weak airlines,” he said. Lufthansa Group chief Carsten Spohr outlined the effect of the coronavirus situation on its operations, stating that the company had withdrawn the equivalent of 23 of 200 long-haul aircraft and up to 25% of its short-haul fleet, depending on developments. He says the outbreak has affected about a third of its Italian capacity. While the fatality rate from coronavirus is relatively low, Walsh would not opine on whether the outbreak had generated an overreaction. “I think it would be wrong for us to just dismiss it,” Walsh told FlightGlobal during the event. Air France-KLM chief Ben Smith said that there were a number of weak carriers in parts of the world, including Asia, and that he believed the outbreak would “accelerate consolidation” within the industry. A4E has backed IATA's request for a temporary suspension of 80:20 slot-use regulations while the outbreak persists. The European organisation used the coronavirus situation to reinforce its call, during the summit, for a review of air transport rules over taxation and legislation – pointing out that it amounts to an “extraordinary circumstance”, which effectively frees airlines from compensation obligations. A4E said the cost of compliance with passenger compensation legislation has increased 30% every year since 2011, costs which have eaten substantially into average yields, but managing director Thomas Reynaert said he was encouraged by the Croatian EU presidency's putting forward a revised framework on passenger rights.",3,593,8.0,0.1461,"government, uk, carrier, business, state, share, south, airway, financial, plan","['iag', 'chief', 'willie', 'walsh', 'firmly', 'reject', 'notion', 'struggle', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'grant', 'state', 'aid', 'help', 'cope', 'impact', 'told', 'summit', 'brussels', 'march', 'outbreak', 'excuse', 'carrier', 'ask', 'state', 'assistance', 'walsh', 'speak', 'summit', 'believe', 'appropriate', 'government', 'provide', 'financial', 'support', 'weak', 'say', 'lufthansa', 'chief', 'carsten', 'spohr', 'outline', 'effect', 'coronavirus', 'situation', 'operation', 'state', 'withdrawn', 'equivalent', 'longhaul', 'shorthaul', 'fleet', 'depend', 'development', 'say', 'outbreak', 'affected', 'third', 'italian', 'capacity', 'fatality', 'rate', 'coronavirus', 'relatively', 'low', 'walsh', 'opine', 'whether', 'outbreak', 'generate', 'overreaction', 'think', 'wrong', 'u', 'dismiss', 'walsh', 'told', 'flightglobal', 'event', 'franceklm', 'chief', 'ben', 'smith', 'say', 'number', 'weak', 'carrier', 'part', 'world', 'include', 'asia', 'believe', 'outbreak', 'accelerate', 'consolidation', 'within', 'industry', 'back', 'iata', 'request', 'temporary', 'suspension', 'slotuse', 'regulation', 'outbreak', 'persists', 'european', 'organisation', 'use', 'coronavirus', 'situation', 'reinforce', 'call', 'summit', 'review', 'transport', 'rule', 'taxation', 'legislation', 'point', 'amount', 'extraordinary', 'circumstance', 'effectively', 'free', 'compensation', 'obligation', 'say', 'cost', 'compliance', 'passenger', 'compensation', 'legislation', 'increase', 'every', 'since', 'cost', 'eat', 'substantially', 'average', 'yield', 'manage', 'director', 'thomas', 'reynaert', 'say', 'encourage', 'croatian', 'eu', 'presidency', 'put', 'forward', 'revise', 'framework', 'passenger', 'right']"
"Europe's much-vaunted single aviation market remains an incomplete initiative, costing airlines €37 billion ($41 billion) per year in terms of disunity in legislation and application of regulations, according to an independent air transport research group. Half of this figure – some €17.4 billion – could be saved by implementing an updated regulatory framework for the Single European Sky programme, says a study from a University of Bergamo specialist centre. Other savings potentially arise from taxation, airport charge, and border-control changes. The International Centre for Competitiveness Studies in the Aviation Industry has conducted the analysis, Cost of Non-Europe in Aviation, for the industry group Airlines for Europe, A4E, which is holding its annual aviation summit in Brussels this week. A4E says the European Union's 'open skies' competitive arena and reduction of air fares remain crucial achievements, after the single aviation market emerged in 1992, but the absence of a seamless airspace structure and revised regulatory framework is still costing airlines substantial sums. The €17.4 billion figure is more than treble the €5 billion saving estimate put forward by the European Commission in 2013, says A4E managing director Thomas Reynaert. “[Full Single European Sky] implementation would allow airlines to put these funds to better use, for example investing them in new aircraft technologies or sustainable aviation fuels,” he says. The ICCSAI study looked at known bottlenecks in the current system as well as new areas that have not been previously quantified. Improvements across five key areas would strengthen the competitiveness of Europe's aviation sector over the long term, it finds. While patching the airspace inefficiencies which fall under the Single European Sky is the primary cost concern, another €16.7 billion could be saved by abolishing “unilateral” aviation taxes which distort the market, says A4E. More effective regulation and better enforcement of the European Union's directive on airport charges could provide €2 billion in savings annually, it adds, while inefficiencies in border controls, inadequate staffing, passenger delays, and inconsistency in customs rules implementation are costing over €1 billion. “Aviation is easily impacted by disruptions in the value chain and therefore requires a holistic approach,” says Reynaert. “We call on the European Commission to take the necessary steps to finally and fully complete the single market for aviation in Europe to unlock these savings for airlines and travellers alike.” A4E leaders attending the Brussels summit insisted that such measures were crucial to ensuring the success of environmental efforts in the industry. ”Failing is simply not an option,” says A4E chairman and Air France-KLM chief Benjamin Smith. A4E carriers are to invest €169 billion in aircraft technologies which, on average, are 25% cleaner and less noisy than their predecessors, the group claims. British Airways and Iberia parent IAG's chief, Willie Walsh, told the summit that the Boeing 737-200s he had flown decades ago were effectively following the same flightpaths that currently exist, and that little had changed in the last 40 years. “Quite honestly, that is a scandal,” he says. “Airlines are doing their share. But in some areas, like air traffic management, we need action from other parts of the industry and EU leaders in order to succeed. Modernisation of European airspace is both urgent and long overdue.” Walsh says some 25 million tonnes of carbon emissions per year could be cut through a redesign of airspace and creation of an integrated system of flightpaths, adding: “Creation of a Single European Sky has been debated for 20 years – we cannot afford to wait any longer.”",3,594,11.0,0.2358,"pilot, faa, issue, safety, include, report, require, training, ground, order","['europe', 'muchvaunted', 'single', 'market', 'remains', 'incomplete', 'initiative', 'cost', 'per', 'term', 'disunity', 'legislation', 'application', 'regulation', 'accord', 'independent', 'transport', 'research', 'half', 'figure', 'save', 'implement', 'update', 'regulatory', 'framework', 'single', 'european', 'sky', 'programme', 'say', 'study', 'university', 'bergamo', 'specialist', 'centre', 'saving', 'potentially', 'arise', 'taxation', 'airport', 'charge', 'bordercontrol', 'change', 'international', 'centre', 'competitiveness', 'study', 'industry', 'conduct', 'analysis', 'cost', 'noneurope', 'industry', 'europe', 'hold', 'annual', 'summit', 'brussels', 'week', 'say', 'european', 'union', 'sky', 'competitive', 'arena', 'reduction', 'fare', 'remain', 'crucial', 'achievement', 'single', 'market', 'emerge', 'absence', 'seamless', 'airspace', 'structure', 'revise', 'regulatory', 'framework', 'still', 'cost', 'substantial', 'sum', 'figure', 'treble', 'save', 'estimate', 'put', 'forward', 'european', 'commission', 'say', 'manage', 'director', 'thomas', 'reynaert', 'full', 'single', 'european', 'sky', 'implementation', 'allow', 'put', 'fund', 'well', 'use', 'example', 'invest', 'technology', 'sustainable', 'fuel', 'say', 'iccsai', 'study', 'look', 'know', 'bottleneck', 'current', 'system', 'well', 'area', 'previously', 'quantify', 'improvement', 'across', 'key', 'area', 'strengthen', 'competitiveness', 'europe', 'sector', 'long', 'term', 'find', 'patch', 'airspace', 'inefficiency', 'fall', 'single', 'european', 'sky', 'primary', 'cost', 'concern', 'another', 'save', 'abolish', 'unilateral', 'tax', 'distort', 'market', 'say', 'effective', 'regulation', 'well', 'enforcement', 'european', 'union', 'directive', 'airport', 'charge', 'provide', 'saving', 'annually', 'add', 'inefficiency', 'border', 'control', 'inadequate', 'staff', 'passenger', 'delay', 'inconsistency', 'custom', 'rule', 'implementation', 'cost', 'easily', 'impact', 'disruption', 'value', 'chain', 'therefore', 'require', 'holistic', 'approach', 'say', 'reynaert', 'call', 'european', 'commission', 'take', 'necessary', 'step', 'finally', 'fully', 'complete', 'single', 'market', 'europe', 'unlock', 'saving', 'traveller', 'leader', 'attend', 'brussels', 'summit', 'insist', 'measure', 'crucial', 'ensure', 'success', 'environmental', 'effort', 'industry', 'fail', 'simply', 'option', 'say', 'chairman', 'franceklm', 'chief', 'benjamin', 'smith', 'carrier', 'invest', 'technology', 'average', 'cleaner', 'less', 'noisy', 'predecessor', 'claim', 'british', 'airway', 'iberia', 'parent', 'iag', 'chief', 'willie', 'walsh', 'told', 'summit', 'flown', 'decade', 'ago', 'effectively', 'follow', 'flightpaths', 'currently', 'exist', 'little', 'change', 'quite', 'honestly', 'scandal', 'say', 'share', 'area', 'like', 'traffic', 'management', 'need', 'action', 'part', 'industry', 'eu', 'leader', 'order', 'succeed', 'modernisation', 'european', 'airspace', 'urgent', 'long', 'walsh', 'say', 'tonne', 'carbon', 'emission', 'per', 'cut', 'redesign', 'airspace', 'creation', 'integrate', 'system', 'flightpaths', 'add', 'creation', 'single', 'european', 'sky', 'debate', 'afford', 'wait', 'longer']"
"Global airline capacity in 2020 has declined by nearly 3% as of 2 March compared to the same period in 2019, Rob Morris, global head of Ascend by Cirium, disclosed at an ISTAT event today. Through the week ended 1 March, global capacity had declined by 2% year-over-year, Cirium schedules data shows. By the time Morris took the stage in Austin the morning of 2 March, this slipped to 2.8%. IATA had forecast on 19 December 4.7% growth in global airline capacity for full-year 2020. That was before the coronavirus spread in China and, ultimately, across the globe. “The black swan has flown in,” Morris said. Airlines facing the biggest threats are those that are exposed to the Chinese market and have large portions of their fleet leased and, consequently, have greater difficulty raising capital, he said. “The word, I think, for the scenario today is chaos. Airlines are hunkering down and are moving into disaster recovery. They're getting ready to just survive a disaster and hopefully come out on the other side. There are no significant airline failures as of today but who knows what tomorrow will bring.” The overarching questions for the global aviation industry are: how much further will demand and capacity drop, and which airlines might not survive the crisis? “How bad can it get? It's very hard to put specific numbers on it,” said Peter Negline, head of strategy and market research for BOC Aviation, at the same event. “We know now that there are problems with the spread of the virus here in the United States. Until we know the extent of all of that we might not know how active the airlines need to be. It might make sense for them to err on the side of caution if need be and shut down a bit more capacity than maybe is justified. [The capacity] will come back fairly quickly as the demand is restored and the virus is hopefully controlled.” “In the current market, it is all about the coronavirus,” said another panelist, Mark Streeter, credit analyst at JP Morgan, emphasising that other issues threatening aviation's growth, such as the grounding of Boeing's 737 Max and expanding trade barriers between nations were now of secondary concern, if that. Streeter said he was “feeling still pretty good” about the ability of major US airlines to manage their way through the crisis. “If we look at the IATA figures for global profitability, US airlines make up about 20% of global capacity, yet 65% of global profits have been in North America. The extreme profitability in North America relative to the rest of the world gives the US airlines a much stronger ability to weather the storm.” US majors will also most likely benefit from their practice of not hedging fuel prices, he added. “In Asia and Europe hedging is still the more common practice. So you have, right now, this massive hit to revenue. And the offset in the US from [low] fuel costs is very significant.” Streeter's concerns about survivability rests more with some low-cost European and US airlines. Negline, putting the human cost aside, suggested that a shakeout of some airlines as demand continues to drop globally would not necessarily be a bad thing for aviation's appeal to investors. “Let's face it, every year for the last 10 years we've had at least five airlines [fail],” he said. “The industry would be doing a lot better if you cut out the 20 largest loss-making airlines.” Streeter said: “Last year in 2019, we had a record number of airlines globally fail, and a record number of aircraft subject to the bankruptcy process. “And that's when economy was still pretty good. Fast-forward to 2020, and we're dealing with the coronavirus. Obviously, this is causing some sort of near-term global recession.” As for last year's “black swan” event – the grounding of the global Max fleet – the absence of expected aircraft from airlines' fleets has eased some of the pain from the sudden drop in customer demand. “Max unavailability for airlines at the moment is a positive,” Cirium's Morris said. “Those aircraft not being there has allowed airlines to reduce capacity and manage their capacity. The scenario of how it returns to service depends on how the coronavirus and demand play out.”",3,595,9.0,0.3826,"industry, crisis, demand, coronavirus, global, iata, market, level, cargo, expect","['global', 'capacity', 'decline', 'nearly', 'march', 'compare', 'period', 'rob', 'morris', 'global', 'head', 'ascend', 'disclose', 'istat', 'event', 'today', 'week', 'end', 'march', 'global', 'capacity', 'decline', 'yearoveryear', 'schedule', 'data', 'morris', 'take', 'stage', 'austin', 'morning', 'march', 'slip', 'iata', 'forecast', 'december', 'growth', 'global', 'capacity', 'fullyear', 'coronavirus', 'spread', 'ultimately', 'across', 'globe', 'black', 'swan', 'flown', 'morris', 'say', 'face', 'big', 'threat', 'expose', 'chinese', 'market', 'large', 'portion', 'fleet', 'lease', 'consequently', 'great', 'difficulty', 'raise', 'capital', 'say', 'word', 'think', 'scenario', 'today', 'chaos', 'hunker', 'move', 'disaster', 'recovery', 'get', 'ready', 'survive', 'disaster', 'hopefully', 'come', 'side', 'significant', 'failure', 'today', 'know', 'tomorrow', 'overarch', 'question', 'global', 'industry', 'much', 'far', 'demand', 'capacity', 'drop', 'might', 'survive', 'crisis', 'bad', 'get', 'hard', 'put', 'specific', 'number', 'say', 'peter', 'negline', 'head', 'strategy', 'market', 'research', 'boc', 'event', 'know', 'problem', 'spread', 'virus', 'united', 'state', 'know', 'extent', 'might', 'know', 'active', 'need', 'might', 'make', 'sense', 'err', 'side', 'caution', 'need', 'shut', 'bit', 'capacity', 'maybe', 'justified', 'capacity', 'come', 'back', 'fairly', 'quickly', 'demand', 'restore', 'virus', 'hopefully', 'current', 'market', 'coronavirus', 'say', 'another', 'panelist', 'mark', 'streeter', 'credit', 'analyst', 'jp', 'morgan', 'emphasise', 'issue', 'threaten', 'growth', 'ground', 'expand', 'trade', 'barrier', 'nation', 'secondary', 'concern', 'streeter', 'say', 'feel', 'still', 'pretty', 'good', 'ability', 'major', 'u', 'manage', 'way', 'crisis', 'look', 'iata', 'figure', 'global', 'profitability', 'u', 'make', 'global', 'capacity', 'yet', 'global', 'profit', 'north', 'america', 'extreme', 'profitability', 'north', 'america', 'relative', 'rest', 'world', 'give', 'u', 'much', 'strong', 'ability', 'weather', 'u', 'major', 'likely', 'benefit', 'practice', 'hedge', 'fuel', 'price', 'add', 'asia', 'europe', 'hedge', 'still', 'common', 'practice', 'right', 'massive', 'hit', 'revenue', 'offset', 'u', 'low', 'fuel', 'cost', 'streeter', 'concern', 'survivability', 'rest', 'lowcost', 'european', 'u', 'negline', 'put', 'human', 'cost', 'aside', 'suggest', 'shakeout', 'demand', 'continue', 'drop', 'globally', 'necessarily', 'bad', 'thing', 'appeal', 'investor', 'let', 'face', 'every', 'least', 'fail', 'say', 'industry', 'lot', 'well', 'cut', 'large', 'lossmaking', 'streeter', 'say', 'record', 'number', 'globally', 'fail', 'record', 'number', 'subject', 'bankruptcy', 'process', 'economy', 'still', 'pretty', 'good', 'fastforward', 'deal', 'coronavirus', 'obviously', 'cause', 'sort', 'nearterm', 'global', 'black', 'swan', 'event', 'ground', 'global', 'fleet', 'absence', 'expect', 'fleet', 'ease', 'pain', 'sudden', 'drop', 'customer', 'demand', 'unavailability', 'moment', 'positive', 'morris', 'say', 'allow', 'reduce', 'capacity', 'manage', 'capacity', 'scenario', 'return', 'service', 'depends', 'coronavirus', 'demand', 'play']"
"Hainan Airlines' parent company, the HNA Group, has requested the Hainan provincial government to set up a working group to look into its risk management efforts. HNA states that it has faced increased liquidity risk of late, in light of the coronavirus outbreak, and was unable to manage the risks by itself. The joint working group, which the provincial government will set up with other relevant parties, will “fully assist” in HNA's risk management work. Gu Gang, chairman of Hainan Development Holdings, the government's investment arm, will lead the joint working group. HNA's appeal for government help comes amid news reports that the group might be taken over by the Chinese government. HNA has faced a liquidity crunch for the past few years. Reports have also suggested that state-owned carriers Air China and China Eastern were preparing to discuss a takeover of HNA's aviation assets. Airlines in the HNA Group, such as Hainan Airlines, have been hard hit by weakened travel demand following the coronavirus outbreak. Hainan Airlines, for example, is reported to have put its foreign pilots on un-paid leave in an attempt to stave off losses.

"Boeing has resurrected and is showing off its Powered JDAM concept believing that the US Air Force (USAF) is keen to buy low-cost cruise missiles. The company has increased development work on the concept within the last 18 months, it says at the Air Force Association Air Warfare Symposium in Orlando, Florida on 28 February. The project was originally begun about eight years ago, but had been put on the back burner due to lukewarm interest from the service. The idea has new life now that the USAF is pursuing glide bomb swarms, such as the Air Force Research Laboratory's Golden Horde project. It is also relevant because of the service's desire for long-range strike options. “Our entire Air Force customer set keeps saying, 'We need range, we need range, we need range,” says Wade Kirkbride, senior marketing representative with Boeing. The Powered JDAM shares a lot of similarities to the glide variant of the JDAM. The Powered JDAM uses a derivative wing kit that is sized between the 2,000lb-class and 500lb-class glider JDAM wing kits. The warhead on the cruise missile variant is also a standard Mark 84 and it would use a regular Guidance Control Unit, says Kirkbride. The important difference between the gliding JDAM and the cruise missile version is a small jet turbine engine. While jet turbines are typically one of the most expensive parts of a cruise missile, the Powered JDAM uses an undisclosed low-cost engine from an undisclosed manufacturer, says Kirkbride. Boeing declines to disclose the cruise missile's exact range, but says that it is comparable to more expensive and sophisticated cruise missiles, such as JASSM, which has a range of 200nm (370km). The cruise missile also doesn't have a stealthy shape and can't fly below-radar, nap-of-the-earth routes like the JASSM. However, it could be networked with other weapons to autonomous attack a target in a swarm, similar to the Golden Horde programme's effort to network gliding GBU-39B Small Diameter Bombs. “We can take that exact same type of capability and put it into Powered JDAM,” says Kirkbride. Ultimately, the idea behind the Powered JDAM is to overwhelm and bankrupt an enemy. “No matter what the enemy tries to shoot down that [cruise missile] with, they're going to lose the battlefield calculus equation,” says Jim Leary, global sales and marketing for weapons with Boeing. “They're going to have to tap some kind of exquisite [and expensive] missile to shoot something like that down. It's going to cost a lot more.”",3,597,1.0,0.5861,"test, force, helicopter, fire, system, service, attack, design, usaf, missile","['resurrect', 'power', 'jdam', 'concept', 'believe', 'u', 'force', 'usaf', 'keen', 'buy', 'lowcost', 'cruise', 'missile', 'increase', 'development', 'work', 'concept', 'within', 'month', 'say', 'force', 'association', 'warfare', 'symposium', 'orlando', 'florida', 'february', 'project', 'originally', 'begin', 'ago', 'put', 'back', 'burner', 'due', 'lukewarm', 'interest', 'service', 'idea', 'life', 'usaf', 'pursue', 'glide', 'bomb', 'swarm', 'force', 'research', 'laboratory', 'golden', 'horde', 'project', 'relevant', 'service', 'desire', 'longrange', 'strike', 'option', 'entire', 'force', 'customer', 'set', 'keep', 'say', 'need', 'range', 'need', 'range', 'need', 'range', 'say', 'wade', 'kirkbride', 'senior', 'marketing', 'representative', 'power', 'jdam', 'share', 'lot', 'similarity', 'glide', 'variant', 'jdam', 'power', 'jdam', 'derivative', 'wing', 'kit', 'size', 'glider', 'jdam', 'wing', 'kit', 'warhead', 'cruise', 'missile', 'variant', 'standard', 'mark', 'use', 'regular', 'guidance', 'control', 'unit', 'say', 'kirkbride', 'important', 'difference', 'glide', 'jdam', 'cruise', 'missile', 'version', 'small', 'jet', 'turbine', 'engine', 'jet', 'turbine', 'typically', 'expensive', 'part', 'cruise', 'missile', 'power', 'jdam', 'undisclosed', 'lowcost', 'engine', 'undisclosed', 'manufacturer', 'say', 'kirkbride', 'decline', 'disclose', 'cruise', 'missile', 'exact', 'range', 'say', 'comparable', 'expensive', 'sophisticated', 'cruise', 'missile', 'jassm', 'range', 'cruise', 'missile', 'stealthy', 'shape', 'ca', 'fly', 'belowradar', 'napoftheearth', 'route', 'like', 'jassm', 'however', 'networked', 'weapon', 'autonomous', 'attack', 'target', 'swarm', 'similar', 'golden', 'horde', 'programme', 'effort', 'network', 'glide', 'small', 'diameter', 'bomb', 'take', 'exact', 'type', 'capability', 'put', 'power', 'jdam', 'say', 'kirkbride', 'ultimately', 'idea', 'behind', 'power', 'jdam', 'overwhelm', 'bankrupt', 'enemy', 'matter', 'enemy', 'try', 'shoot', 'cruise', 'missile', 'go', 'lose', 'battlefield', 'calculus', 'equation', 'say', 'jim', 'leary', 'global', 'sale', 'marketing', 'weapon', 'go', 'tap', 'kind', 'exquisite', 'expensive', 'missile', 'shoot', 'something', 'like', 'go', 'cost', 'lot']"
"German start-up Lilium says the start of flight testing of the second electric-powered Lilium Jet prototype could be delayed by several weeks as it determines what caused the first test aircraft to catch fire during maintenance on 27 February. Lilium says the aircraft was “damaged beyond repair” at its base at Oberpfaffenhofen airport near Munich, but the second example, which is near completion and was being readied for its maiden sortie in the second quarter, was untouched by the blaze. “Flight-testing of the second Lilium Jet will only begin when we have discovered the root cause of the fire and implemented any necessary updates into the aircraft,” says Lilium. “Safety is our key concern.” The company says the fire is “not a major setback” for the programme as it “intended to transition to the second prototype as soon as it was ready”. Since its first flight on 4 May 2019 the initial test article had made “hundreds of air and ground tests”, says Lilium, including the crucial transition from vertical to horizontal flight. “We were working towards full wing-borne flight with the aircraft,” the company adds. The five-seat Lilium Jet is powered by 36 electrically driven fans distributed across two sets of wings. It has a projected range of 160nm (300km) and a maximum speed of 160kt (296km/h). Service entry, initially as a manned aircraft, remains on track for 2025, with the jet designed for inter-city and short regional flights.

"IATA is contacting aviation regulators to request the suspension of rules governing airport slots for the remainder of the current season and for the upcoming summer timetable as airlines pull back capacity in the light of the spread of the coronavirus. Existing slot rules at co-ordinated airports require airlines to operate at least 80% of their allocated slots under normal circumstances or risk losing the slots for the following season. IATA says 43% of all passengers depart from the more than 200 slot co-ordinated airports. IATA director general Alexandre de Juniac says there are precedents for the suspension of slot rules Airlines have been paring back capacity as a result of the drop in air travel demand related to the coronavirus outbreak. Many carriers had suspended flights to mainland China, the source of the initial outbreak of the virus, through to the end of March and are now extending these suspensions into April. But capacity reductions across wider networks are becoming increasingly common as new pockets of incidence of the coronavirus emerge. ”Given these extraordinary circumstances as a result of the public health emergency, the collective view of the airline industry is that the application the 80% rule during the upcoming season inappropriate,” IATA argues. ”Flexibility is needed for airlines to adjust their schedules according to extraordinary demand developments.” It notes regulators have already been waiving the slot rules on a rolling basis during the crisis primarily for operations to China and Hong Kong. It argues suspending the requirement for the entire season running to October would enable airlines to respond to market conditions with appropriate capacity levels, avoiding any need to run empty services in order to maintain slots. ”IATA research has shown that traffic has collapsed on key Asian routes and that this is rippling throughout the air transport network globally, even between countries without major outbreaks of COVID-19,” says IATA director general Alexandre de Juniac. ”There are precedents for previous suspension of the slot use rules and we believe the circumstances again calls for a suspension to be granted.” In initial guidance issued on 20 February, IATA indicated air travel could fall for the first year in more than a decade if the coronavirus had a similar impact as the SARS virushad on demand.",3,599,9.0,0.3785,"industry, crisis, demand, coronavirus, global, iata, market, level, cargo, expect","['iata', 'contact', 'regulator', 'request', 'suspension', 'rule', 'govern', 'airport', 'slot', 'remainder', 'current', 'season', 'upcoming', 'summer', 'timetable', 'pull', 'back', 'capacity', 'light', 'spread', 'coronavirus', 'exist', 'slot', 'rule', 'coordinate', 'airport', 'require', 'operate', 'least', 'allocate', 'slot', 'normal', 'circumstance', 'risk', 'lose', 'slot', 'follow', 'season', 'iata', 'say', 'passenger', 'depart', 'slot', 'coordinate', 'airport', 'iata', 'director', 'general', 'alexandre', 'de', 'juniac', 'say', 'precedent', 'suspension', 'slot', 'rule', 'par', 'back', 'capacity', 'result', 'drop', 'travel', 'demand', 'related', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'many', 'carrier', 'suspend', 'mainland', 'source', 'initial', 'outbreak', 'virus', 'end', 'march', 'extend', 'suspension', 'april', 'capacity', 'reduction', 'across', 'wider', 'network', 'become', 'increasingly', 'common', 'pocket', 'incidence', 'coronavirus', 'emerge', 'give', 'extraordinary', 'circumstance', 'result', 'public', 'health', 'emergency', 'collective', 'view', 'industry', 'application', 'rule', 'upcoming', 'season', 'inappropriate', 'iata', 'argues', 'flexibility', 'need', 'adjust', 'schedule', 'accord', 'extraordinary', 'demand', 'note', 'regulator', 'already', 'waive', 'slot', 'rule', 'roll', 'basis', 'crisis', 'primarily', 'operation', 'hong', 'kong', 'argues', 'suspend', 'requirement', 'entire', 'season', 'run', 'october', 'enable', 'respond', 'market', 'condition', 'appropriate', 'capacity', 'level', 'avoid', 'need', 'run', 'empty', 'service', 'order', 'maintain', 'slot', 'iata', 'research', 'traffic', 'collapse', 'key', 'asian', 'route', 'ripple', 'throughout', 'transport', 'network', 'globally', 'even', 'country', 'without', 'major', 'outbreak', 'coronavirus', 'say', 'iata', 'director', 'general', 'alexandre', 'de', 'juniac', 'precedent', 'previous', 'suspension', 'slot', 'use', 'rule', 'believe', 'circumstance', 'call', 'suspension', 'initial', 'guidance', 'issue', 'february', 'iata', 'indicate', 'travel', 'fall', 'decade', 'coronavirus', 'similar', 'impact', 'sars', 'virushad', 'demand']"
"Thai Airways International's losses widened by Bt3.4 billion ($109 million) to Bt12.4 billion in 2019, as revenues fell despite increased passenger numbers. Operating revenue declined by 7.7% to Bt184 billion, as passenger revenue fell 7% to Bt149 billion while the cargo segment plunged 20.4% to Bt17.8 billion. Among the factors cited by the carrier are the civil unrest in Hong Kong, suspension of its Pakistan services due to airspace closure, strong competition from low-cost and Middle Eastern operators, and impact from the US-China trade war. Even though passenger numbers gained 1% to 24.5 million, yields fell by 6.8% to Bt2.04 due to currency losses. With RPKs down 1% against a 2.7% decline in ASKs, load factor gained 1.5 points to 79.1%. Total operating expenses declined 5.8% to Bt196 billion, on lower fuel costs and other operating expenses. Despite the sharp decline in operating losses, net loss widened by just Bt417 million to Bt12 billion in 2019, largely due Bt4.4 billion “gain on foreign currency exchange”. As at 31 December 2019, cash and cash equivalents amounted to Bt21.7 billion, up from Bt13.7 billion one year before. The airline's fleet remained unchanged at 103 aircraft, including the 20 Airbus A320s operated by its subsidiary Thai Smile. It has also put up 15 Airbus and Boeing jets for sale. Looking ahead, Thai says the impact of the coronavirus has pushed the carrier to reduce flights and it is in the process of establishing a working group to monitor the situation. Other negative factors include the US-China trade war, political uncertainties after Brexit, and USA-Iran conflicts. The Star Alliance member will focus on raising revenue through greater digitalisation and use of data, effective cost control, as well as improving operational efficiency by expediting the stalled aircraft acquisition plan and selling older aircraft.

"Indonesia's Lion Air Group has put on hold plans for an initial public offering, a source tells Cirium. The company was expected to make the call at the end of February, but the person says some investors have been reluctant to hold face-to-face meetings amid the coronavirus outbreak. Moreover, it has been difficult to get investors on board given the regional and global downturn in airline stocks. “Even if the traffic in Indonesia is still very strong, the reality is investors cannot understand that. There is no point trying to launch it now,” a person with knowledge of the IPO says. Citing unidentified sources close to the matter, reports by Reuters indicate that the company planned to raise as much as $500 million. It launched a pre-marketing drive in January to gauge investor appetite and held roadshows across global finance centres in the early part of February. Lion Air Group tells Cirium the company “does not comment on market speculation”. The company first expressed an interest to go public in 2011, proposing that around 30% of its shares could be floated in 2012 to raise around $1 billion. Lion Air founder Rusdi Kirana said in an April 2014 interview that the IPO would only take place after the group gained a 65% market share in Indonesia. In November 2014, John Duffy, then head of the company's aircraft leasing arm, indicated that Lion was “seriously considering an IPO in the second half” of 2015. In a February 2015 interview, Kirana explained that one of the rationales for the IPO was to fund an airport project in Lebak Regency, an hour's drive from the capital Jakarta. This would help meet its expansion needs, which were constrained by the congestion at Soekarno-Hatta international airport. That airport project was eventually scrapped amid Jakarta's concern of possible disruption to air traffic at a nearby airport. Only in February 2017 did Kirana admit that all plans for an IPO had been put on ice as market conditions were not conducive. Last November, Lion told Cirium that it was postponing the IPO plan in 2019 because it “wanted to determine the right timing [to conduct the IPO]”.

"United Airlines has suspended some of its flights to Tokyo, Osaka, Singapore and Seoul and extended its flight cancellations to mainland China and Hong Kong through 30 April. The Chicago-based airline has cancelled flights from Los Angeles and Houston to Tokyo Narita between 8 March and 24 April, and flights from Chicago O'Hare to Tokyo Narita between 8 and 27 March. After 28 March, the Chicago route will switch to Tokyo Haneda. As of 28 February, United states that it will proceed with its regularly scheduled flights to Tokyo Haneda in March and April. Flights from Newark to Tokyo Narita will be reduced to five times weekly from daily in April, and flights from Honolulu to Tokyo Narita will be downgauged the same month.

"Bangkok Airways boosted operating profit 18% to Bt1.68 billion ($53.2 million) last year, despite a decline in revenue from the passenger segment. Revenue rose 2.4% to Bt28.6 billion. However, passenger revenue fell 6.9% to nearly Bt18.9 billion, which the carrier attributed to a strengthening of the Thai baht against major currencies, a 1.6% decline in overall passenger numbers to 5.86 million, and strong competition. Net profit climbed 41% to nearly Bt351 million. Passenger load factor declined marginally to 68.1%, as increases in the domestic figure could not compensate a fall in the international one. Passenger yield fell 4.2%. Traffic was down 3.1%, as capacity was cut 2.4%. Unit costs including fuel edged up 2.6% and was up 4% ex-fuel.

"American Airlines and Delta Air Lines cancelled their flights to northern Italy as passengers become increasingly skittish about traveling to areas where the coronavirus, also known as COVID-19, has rapidly spread in the past few days. “Due to the reduction in demand, American Airlines is suspending operations to and from Milan, Italy, and New York and Miami,” American says in a statement on 29 February. “Flights to Milan are scheduled to resume April 25. American continues to review the airline's flight schedule to ensure that customers' needs are accommodated and will make additional refinements as necessary.” American Airlines Boeing 777 American, headquartered in Fort Worth, operates flights from John F Kennedy international airport to Milan-Malpensa four times every week, and from Miami six times. It also says on Sunday that it will be waiving all change fees for any flights booked in its network during the first two weeks of March. Delta Air Lines joins American, saying on Sunday, “Delta is temporarily suspending its daily flight between New York - John F. Kennedy International Airport and Milan Malpensa Airport. Delta's last east-bound flight from JFK to Milan will depart on Monday, March 2, and the last west-bound flight from Milan to JFK will depart on Tuesday, March 3. Service to and from Milan will resume starting on May 1 and May 2, respectively.” The Atlanta-based airline adds that its daily flights from New York and Atlanta to Rome are unaffected. United Airlines, which operates a daily flight to Milan from its Newark hub, could not be reached for comment. Last week, United reduced capacity to Japan, Singapore and South Korea. Hawaiian Airlines suspended its five-times weekly service to Seoul. All US airlines stopped flying to mainland China and Hong Kong in early February. According to the World Health Organization, as of 1 March, the coronavirus has sickened more than 87,000 people worldwide, and killed almost 3,000. The majority of those cases are in China and Hong Kong, but South Korea and Italy have registered 3,736 and 1,128 cases respectively. Last Wednesday, the US government announced a coronavirus task force designed to keep tabs on the spread of the disease, but in the past few days, government experts have been inconsistent in messages about the potential spread as well as making contingency plans and taking protective measures. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a warning that outbreaks of coronavirus in the USA are inevitable, however top government officials dispute those expectations. Washington state announced the first US death from the virus on 29 February, and state health authorities say on Sunday that the disease has probably been spreading in the region for the past six weeks. The United States is currently reporting 64 cases of the coronavirus. On 1 March the US government outlined new travel restrictions, adding Iran to the list of countries from which entry will be curtailed. Any non-US citizen who has visited Iran and China in the past 14 days will not be permitted to enter the country. US citizens and permanent residents who meet those criteria must enter the country at one of 11 “approved airports”.

"Rolls-Royce insists the Trent 1000 remains a competitive powerplant despite the technical problems, and the defection of high-profile customers to the rival General Electric GEnx. Japan's All Nippon Airways has opted for the GEnx, rather than the incumbent Trent, for its latest batch of Boeing 787s. Air New Zealand also selected the GEnx for a follow-on order last year. But Rolls-Royce chief executive Warren East, while admitting that the company is “obviously disappointed” by the ANA decision, has shrugged off the switch. “We look at it from a fairly macro position,” he said during a 28 February briefing. “It's not just about share on the 787 it's about share of widebody orders.” East points out that Rolls-Royce's position on this broader front is “a reasonable result”, and that the ANA decision should be put into perspective, given that it has over 80 Trent-powered 787s. “To be 100%-dependent on Rolls-Royce when you have a choice is, perhaps, an unrealistic assumption when you get to a fleet growing to that sort of size,” he says. “To have 15 aircraft and a few options going to GE is not something that particularly surprises us.” He stresses that all of ANA's Trent-powered 787s will be “in the air, rather than on the ground” over the next few weeks, ahead of the Olympic Games in Tokyo. “There are Trent 1000 [order] opportunities for us this year – we do hope to take orders this year,” adds East, highlighting the powerplant's overall performance and reliability. East acknowledges that a lack of spare engines – a consequence of being short on capacity – contributed to Rolls-Royce's burden as it strived to deal with the technical problems, and stresses that the company is working to address this.",2,606,6.0,0.211,"engine, maintenance, fuel, takeoff, result, failure, system, problem, power, issue","['rollsroyce', 'insists', 'trent', 'remains', 'competitive', 'powerplant', 'despite', 'technical', 'problem', 'defection', 'highprofile', 'customer', 'rival', 'general', 'electric', 'genx', 'japan', 'nippon', 'airway', 'opt', 'genx', 'rather', 'incumbent', 'trent', 'late', 'batch', 'zealand', 'select', 'genx', 'followon', 'order', 'rollsroyce', 'chief', 'executive', 'warren', 'east', 'admit', 'obviously', 'disappointed', 'ana', 'decision', 'shrug', 'switch', 'look', 'fairly', 'macro', 'position', 'say', 'february', 'briefing', 'share', 'share', 'widebody', 'east', 'point', 'rollsroyce', 'position', 'broader', 'front', 'reasonable', 'result', 'ana', 'decision', 'put', 'perspective', 'give', 'trentpowered', 'dependent', 'rollsroyce', 'choice', 'perhaps', 'unrealistic', 'assumption', 'get', 'fleet', 'grow', 'sort', 'size', 'say', 'option', 'go', 'ge', 'something', 'particularly', 'surprise', 'stress', 'ana', 'trentpowered', 'rather', 'ground', 'next', 'week', 'ahead', 'olympic', 'game', 'tokyo', 'trent', 'order', 'opportunity', 'u', 'hope', 'take', 'order', 'add', 'east', 'highlight', 'powerplant', 'overall', 'performance', 'reliability', 'east', 'acknowledges', 'lack', 'spare', 'engine', 'consequence', 'short', 'capacity', 'contribute', 'rollsroyce', 'burden', 'strive', 'deal', 'technical', 'problem', 'stress', 'work', 'address']"
"One of Kenyan regional carrier Fly540's Bombardier Dash 8-300 turboprops has made an emergency landing, apparently on open ground, after an engine failure. The aircraft (5Y-CGH) came down near Kapese, an airfield in north-western Kenya. Fly540 says the aircraft sustained a “suspected foreign-object strike” which resulted in an engine failure. The captain decided to carry out an emergency landing at Kapese, although images purportedly captured at the scene indicate the aircraft came to rest in an open area of rough ground. Fly540 has not indicated the distance from the runway, nor confirmed the number of occupantsd.

"Safran believes it now understands the reasons behind the crash of a Patroller unmanned air vehicle (UAV) last December – an incident that took place shortly before the initial example was due to be delivered to the French army. The aircraft was destroyed when it came down near the town of Saint-Mitre-Les-Remparts on 6 December during an “industrial reception flight” from Istres air base in the south of the country. Speaking on a full-year earnings call on 27 February, Safran chief executive Philippe Petitcolin said: “we know what happened in terms of the failure of the system” during the flight test. “We are now doing our job in order to clean all this system and make it completely in line with the requirements of the customer,” he adds. However, Petitcolin provides no further detail on the causes of the crash or the modifications made to the platform. Paris ordered 14 examples for its army in 2016, with first delivery due last year.

"Airbus's A350-900 helped Rolls-Royce to cut its average unit losses on its large engine programmes last year, and contributed to the powerplant manufacturer's achieving a record 510 Trent engine deliveries. Average original equipment unit losses for its large engines fell by 14%, from £1.4 million to £1.2 million, last year as production of the A350-900 – powered by the Trent XWB-84 – continued to mature. Rolls-Royce says the specific deficit on the XWB-84 was reduced by over 20% last year and it expects to deliver its first break-even XWB-84 by the end of this year. Airbus's ramp-up of A330neo output also assisted Rolls-Royce's delivery figures, with the manufacturer handing over 106 Trent 7000 engines for the twinjet – with 80 flying – compared with just eight in the previous year. Rolls-Royce says the powerplant has achieved 99.9% dispatch reliability. Total installed large Rolls-Royce engines passed the 5,000 mark during 2019 as a result of the higher deliveries. The company puts the installed base at 5,029 powerplants, of which 32% are Trent 700s for earlier models of the A330. As of last year the A350 accounts for the second-largest number of Trent engines by volume. Early Trent XWB-84 engines have reached the company's original expectations for time-on-wing, says Rolls-Royce, with fleet-leading engines flying over 22,000h without a shop visit. Rolls-Royce also produces the Trent 900 for the A380, the final example of which is nearing final assembly in Toulouse following the decision to terminate the programme. While it had recorded an additional exceptional charge of £59 million in the first half of last year, following an updated impact assessment from the termination, this has been revised down to £48 million at year-end.",2,609,6.0,0.288,"engine, maintenance, fuel, takeoff, result, failure, system, problem, power, issue","['help', 'rollsroyce', 'cut', 'average', 'unit', 'loss', 'large', 'engine', 'programme', 'contribute', 'powerplant', 'manufacturer', 'achieve', 'record', 'trent', 'engine', 'delivery', 'average', 'original', 'equipment', 'unit', 'loss', 'large', 'engine', 'fell', 'production', 'power', 'trent', 'continued', 'mature', 'rollsroyce', 'say', 'specific', 'deficit', 'reduce', 'expect', 'deliver', 'breakeven', 'end', 'rampup', 'output', 'assist', 'rollsroyce', 'delivery', 'figure', 'manufacturer', 'hand', 'trent', 'engine', 'twinjet', 'fly', 'compare', 'previous', 'rollsroyce', 'say', 'powerplant', 'achieve', 'dispatch', 'reliability', 'total', 'instal', 'large', 'rollsroyce', 'engine', 'pass', 'mark', 'result', 'high', 'delivery', 'put', 'instal', 'base', 'powerplants', 'trent', 'earlier', 'model', 'account', 'secondlargest', 'number', 'trent', 'engine', 'volume', 'early', 'trent', 'engine', 'reach', 'original', 'expectation', 'timeonwing', 'say', 'rollsroyce', 'fleetleading', 'engine', 'fly', 'without', 'shop', 'visit', 'rollsroyce', 'produce', 'trent', 'final', 'example', 'near', 'final', 'assembly', 'toulouse', 'follow', 'decision', 'terminate', 'programme', 'record', 'additional', 'exceptional', 'charge', 'half', 'follow', 'update', 'impact', 'assessment', 'termination', 'revise', 'yearend']"
"Finnair is taking a more pessimistic view of the potential impact from the coronavirus outbreak, expecting it to result in significantly lower operating profits for the first half. It is looking to trim costs by €40-50 million ($44-55 million) to cope with the threat to its revenue streams, and is considering measures such as temporary lay-offs, recruitment adjustment, and changes to sales and marketing activity. The airline had initially predicted, just two weeks ago, a relatively limited impact from the outbreak, and still intended a 4% capacity increase for 2020. But in a revised outlook it says the situation is “fast-developing” and that coronavirus is having a wider than estimated effect on the air transport market. It has already backed away from its capacity plans, and says it will adjust capacity to meet demand – without indicating how great that demand might be. But the airline believes its comparable operating result for the first quarter will be lower than the previous year, and that there will be a negative impact on revenues in the second quarter, leading to a “significantly lower” operating result for the period.  Finnair's Asia network strategy has left it exposed to Chinese route disruption Finnair is exposed to the coronavirus through its Chinese and other Asia-Pacific operations, as well as its short-haul network given the spread of the outbreak to Europe. “It is difficult to foresee how the situation will evolve during the coming months,” says chief executive Topi Manner. “As the coronavirus situation has entered a new phase with outbreaks in several new countries, we will take appropriate measures to adapt our costs, operations and resources to better match our revenues.”",2,610,3.0,0.2366,"passenger, loss, operating, revenue, traffic, month, increase, capacity, decline, result","['finnair', 'take', 'pessimistic', 'view', 'potential', 'impact', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'expect', 'result', 'significantly', 'low', 'operating', 'profit', 'half', 'look', 'trim', 'cost', 'cope', 'threat', 'revenue', 'stream', 'consider', 'measure', 'temporary', 'layoff', 'recruitment', 'adjustment', 'change', 'sale', 'marketing', 'activity', 'initially', 'predict', 'week', 'ago', 'relatively', 'limited', 'impact', 'outbreak', 'still', 'intend', 'capacity', 'increase', 'revise', 'outlook', 'say', 'situation', 'fastdeveloping', 'coronavirus', 'wider', 'estimate', 'effect', 'transport', 'market', 'already', 'back', 'away', 'capacity', 'plan', 'say', 'adjust', 'capacity', 'meet', 'demand', 'without', 'indicate', 'great', 'demand', 'might', 'believe', 'comparable', 'operating', 'result', 'quarter', 'low', 'previous', 'negative', 'impact', 'revenue', 'second', 'quarter', 'lead', 'significantly', 'low', 'operating', 'result', 'period', 'finnair', 'asia', 'network', 'strategy', 'left', 'expose', 'chinese', 'route', 'disruption', 'finnair', 'expose', 'coronavirus', 'chinese', 'asiapacific', 'operation', 'well', 'shorthaul', 'network', 'give', 'spread', 'outbreak', 'europe', 'difficult', 'foresee', 'situation', 'evolve', 'come', 'month', 'say', 'chief', 'executive', 'topi', 'manner', 'coronavirus', 'situation', 'enter', 'phase', 'outbreak', 'several', 'country', 'take', 'appropriate', 'measure', 'adapt', 'cost', 'operation', 'resource', 'well', 'match', 'revenue']"
"AirAsia X will ask lessors for lease reductions across its entire fleet as the coronavirus crisis puts a strain on its business. The Malaysian low-cost long-haul carrier has targeted a 30% lease reduction and plans to renegotiate maintenance reserves. It is also seeking the early return of five leased aircraft to save costs, according to an investor presentation released alongside the airline's 2019 financial results. Cirium reported earlier this month that AirAsia X approached lessors for lease rental deferrals, though it declined to confirm then. In addition to renegotiating lease rentals, the LCC says it will defer delivery of its new generation Airbus A330-900neos and intends to sell two A330-300s for gross cash proceeds of up to $100 million. It adds that it has short-term wet lease arrangements in the pipeline. “The Covid-19 outbreak has impacted AirAsia X particularly as we are one of the largest foreign airlines operating into China, a market which represents 30% of our capacity,” says chief executive, Benyamin Ismail. He adds that the airline is considering using 236-seater A321s for medium-haul thin routes as this would “better match demand than the 377-seater A330”. The A330s will continue to serve routes longer than six hours. “Despite these very challenging circumstances we wish to provide assurance that efforts are in place to counter the impact of the current situation.”",2,611,2.0,0.2316,"executive, chief, cut, add, situation, staff, crisis, make, coronavirus, employee","['airasia', 'x', 'ask', 'lessor', 'lease', 'reduction', 'across', 'entire', 'fleet', 'coronavirus', 'crisis', 'put', 'strain', 'business', 'malaysian', 'lowcost', 'longhaul', 'carrier', 'target', 'lease', 'reduction', 'plan', 'renegotiate', 'maintenance', 'reserve', 'seek', 'early', 'return', 'lease', 'save', 'cost', 'accord', 'investor', 'presentation', 'release', 'alongside', 'financial', 'result', 'report', 'earlier', 'month', 'airasia', 'x', 'approach', 'lessor', 'lease', 'rental', 'deferral', 'though', 'decline', 'confirm', 'addition', 'renegotiate', 'lease', 'rental', 'lcc', 'say', 'defer', 'delivery', 'generation', 'intend', 'sell', 'gross', 'cash', 'proceeds', 'add', 'shortterm', 'wet', 'lease', 'arrangement', 'pipeline', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'impact', 'airasia', 'x', 'particularly', 'large', 'foreign', 'operating', 'market', 'represent', 'capacity', 'say', 'chief', 'executive', 'benyamin', 'ismail', 'add', 'consider', 'use', 'mediumhaul', 'thin', 'route', 'well', 'match', 'demand', 'continue', 'serve', 'route', 'longer', 'hour', 'despite', 'challenge', 'circumstance', 'wish', 'provide', 'assurance', 'effort', 'place', 'counter', 'impact', 'current', 'situation']"
"British Airways and Iberia parent IAG's operating profit before exceptional items slipped 5.7% for the full year in 2019 to €3.29 billion ($3.6 billion) as its fuel costs rose. However notably the group says the impact of the coronavirus outbreak, which has already caused a drop in air travel demand in its short and long-haul business, makes it impossible to issue guidance for the year ahead. For 2019 IAG lifted group revenues 5.1% to €25.5 billion including positive currency effects, while total costs rose 7% to €22.8 billion. Notably its fuel, oil and emissions costs were 10% higher, largely as hedging benefits from 2018 unwound. The Group's operating margin slipped by 1.5 points to 12.9 per cent. ”These results reflect the industrial action at British Airways and disruption at London Heathrow in the summer, which had an adverse impact of approximately €170 million. In the second half of the year, weakness and disruption faced by the Group's low-cost segments had a further adverse impact of approximately €45 million,” IAG says. BA still delivered the bulk of group profits for 2019. The UK carrier delivered an operating profit before exceptional items of €1.92 billion - down 5.1%. Iberia profits were down 6.7% to €497 million; Aer Lingus profits fell 11.4% to €274 million; while Spanish low-cost operator Vueling recorded a 9.3% fall in profits to €240 million. IAG chief executive Willie Walsh - who steps down in June - says: ”These are good results in a year affected by disruption and higher fuel prices. We demonstrated our robust and flexible model once again through additional cost control and by reducing capacity growth to reflect market conditions.” But the group adds the earnings outlook is adversely affected by weaker demand as a result of coronavirus outbreak. ”We are currently experiencing demand weakness on Asian and European routes and a weakening of business travel across our network resulting from the cancellation of industry events and corporate travel restrictions,” IAG says. The carrier has suspended flights to malnland China and reduced capacity on some other Asian services. It has also reduced capacity on Italian routes, following the spread of the outbreak to northern Italy. “Further capacity reductions will be activated over the coming days. We also expect to make some capacity reductions across our wider short-haul network. Short-haul capacity is not being redeployed at this stage,” it adds. ”Our operating companies will continue to take mitigating actions to better match supply to demand in line with the evolving situation. Cost and revenue initiatives are being implemented across the business. ”Given the ongoing uncertainty on the potential impact and duration of COVID-19, it is not possible to give accurate profit guidance for full-year 2020 at this stage,” IAG says.",2,612,3.0,0.281,"passenger, loss, operating, revenue, traffic, month, increase, capacity, decline, result","['british', 'airway', 'iberia', 'parent', 'iag', 'operating', 'profit', 'exceptional', 'item', 'slip', 'full', 'fuel', 'cost', 'rise', 'however', 'notably', 'say', 'impact', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'already', 'cause', 'drop', 'travel', 'demand', 'short', 'longhaul', 'business', 'make', 'impossible', 'issue', 'guidance', 'ahead', 'iag', 'lift', 'revenue', 'include', 'positive', 'currency', 'effect', 'total', 'cost', 'rise', 'notably', 'fuel', 'oil', 'emission', 'cost', 'high', 'largely', 'hedge', 'benefit', 'unwound', 'operating', 'margin', 'slip', 'point', 'per', 'cent', 'result', 'reflect', 'industrial', 'action', 'british', 'airway', 'disruption', 'london', 'heathrow', 'summer', 'adverse', 'impact', 'approximately', 'second', 'half', 'weakness', 'disruption', 'face', 'lowcost', 'segment', 'far', 'adverse', 'impact', 'approximately', 'iag', 'say', 'ba', 'still', 'deliver', 'bulk', 'profit', 'uk', 'carrier', 'deliver', 'operating', 'profit', 'exceptional', 'item', 'iberia', 'profit', 'aer', 'lingus', 'profit', 'fell', 'spanish', 'lowcost', 'operator', 'vueling', 'record', 'fall', 'profit', 'iag', 'chief', 'executive', 'willie', 'walsh', 'step', 'june', 'say', 'good', 'result', 'affected', 'disruption', 'high', 'fuel', 'price', 'demonstrate', 'robust', 'flexible', 'model', 'additional', 'cost', 'control', 'reduce', 'capacity', 'growth', 'reflect', 'market', 'add', 'earnings', 'outlook', 'adversely', 'affected', 'weaker', 'demand', 'result', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'currently', 'experience', 'demand', 'weakness', 'asian', 'european', 'route', 'weaken', 'business', 'travel', 'across', 'network', 'result', 'cancellation', 'industry', 'event', 'corporate', 'travel', 'restriction', 'iag', 'say', 'carrier', 'suspend', 'malnland', 'reduce', 'capacity', 'asian', 'service', 'reduce', 'capacity', 'italian', 'route', 'follow', 'spread', 'outbreak', 'northern', 'italy', 'far', 'capacity', 'reduction', 'activate', 'come', 'day', 'expect', 'make', 'capacity', 'reduction', 'across', 'wider', 'shorthaul', 'network', 'shorthaul', 'capacity', 'redeployed', 'stage', 'add', 'operating', 'continue', 'take', 'mitigate', 'action', 'well', 'match', 'supply', 'demand', 'line', 'evolve', 'situation', 'cost', 'revenue', 'initiative', 'implement', 'across', 'business', 'give', 'ongoing', 'uncertainty', 'potential', 'impact', 'duration', 'coronavirus', 'possible', 'give', 'accurate', 'profit', 'guidance', 'fullyear', 'stage', 'iag', 'say']"
"AirAsia X narrowed its operating loss to MYR90.1 million ($21.3 million), despite a decline in passenger numbers which affected its total revenue. The loss posted in 2019 is an improvement to the MYR204 million loss made in 2018. Revenue for the year ended 31 December 2019 declined 4% to MYR4.4 billion, as the number of passengers fell 8.3% to 6.07 million due to capacity cuts it undertook, and weaker travel demand in the first nine months of 2019. Total expenses fell 5.8% to MYR4.05 billion, on lower expenditures related to fuel, user charges, and other operating expenses. Unit cost without fuel were 1.9 cents, and including fuel, this was 2.5% lower year-on-year to 3.1 cents. While RASK was unchanged at 3 cents, RPKs were down 3%. Seat load factor was flat at 81%, and that seat capacity declined 2%. Net loss, however, swelled to more than MYR489 million, on significant increases in finance costs and the adoption of a new accounting standard on leases. As of 31 December 2019, the company's cash and cash equivalents stood at nearly MYR308 million, up from the MYR253 million last year. Overseas units in Indonesia and Thailand saw a mixed performance. Indonesia AirAsia X cut its losses while Thai AirAsia X reversed its previously profitable streak. Indonesia AirAsia X reduced its operating losses by more than half to MYR36.7 million, after ceasing scheduled services for charter and wet-lease operations at the start of 2019. Revenue for the year stood at MYR76.6 million, while loss before tax was MYR47.3 million. Thai AirAsia X posted an operating loss of more than MYR137 million for 2019, reversing the operating profit of MYR48.7 million in 2018. Revenue grew 17.3% to MYR1.79 billion, while loss before tax came in at MYR86.5 million. AirAsia X's Malaysia chief Benyamin Ismail says the airline has seen “significant improvements” in its business performance, as it focused on improving yields in core markets. It also began a Kuala Lumpur-Singapore service to support the route's strong demand, as well as Kuala Lumpur-Tokyo Narita. In its outlook detailed in an investor presentation, AirAsia X plans to cancel unprofitable routes such as Jaipur, Lanzhou and Tianjin, and explore route suspensions as it tries to overcome the challenges from the coronavirus outbreak. It notes that China represents a third of its capacity, and this “poses [a] severe impact” on the company. An “aggressive” capacity management will be made in the first half of 2020, with more than 600 flights cancelled in March.

"Nok Air saw efficiency gains from implementing a turnaround programme last year and narrowed financial losses, but ended 2019 in a weaker cash position. The Thai low-cost carrier says it is expanding route and flight network, aircraft utilisation rate and “efficiency in business operation”, while reducing its fleet will allow it to save on costs like aircraft rental, maintenance and personnel. During the year, Nok increased average aircraft utilisation from 9.36h per day in 2018 to 9.96h in 2019. It ended the period with a fleet of 24 aircraft, having removed two ATR 72-500s while adding one Boeing 737-800. The airline and its subsidiaries posted a net loss of Bt3 billion ($93.8 million) for the year ended 31 December 2019, down from 2018's Bt4 billion net loss.

Nok says items that “highly affected” cash flow are “trade and other current payables, aircraft maintenance reserves and aircraft maintenance paid”. The carrier says that it raised over Bt1.5 billion this month from issuing new stock, which will help improve its financial status.

The crash occurred at 13:16 local time on 23 January near Peak View, New South Wales, killing all three crew members. The aircraft involved was operated by Coulson Aviation, and bore the registration N134CG (MSN4904). After departing from RAAF Richmond at 12:05 the aircraft was diverted from its initial drop zone to a secondary tasking. “Witnesses reported seeing the aircraft complete a number of circuits, prior to completing the retardant drop,” says the ATSB. “The drop was conducted on a heading of about 190°, at about 200ft above ground level, with a drop time of approximately 2 seconds. The crew released about 1,200 US gallons (4,500 L) of fire retardant during the drop.” After the drop, say ground observers, the aircraft banked left and was obscured by smoke for about 15 seconds. When the aircraft reappeared it was “flying at a very low height above the ground, in a left wing down attitude. Shortly after, at about 13:16, the aircraft collided with terrain and a post-impact fuel-fed fire ensued. The three crew were fatally injured and the aircraft was destroyed.” No distress calls were made prior to impact. The initial investigation suggests the aircraft hit a tree when in the left wing down attitude prior to colliding with the ground. An emergency dump of retardant was not activated. Meteorological information on the day of the crash indicated gusting winds and “severe turbulence below 5,000ft above ground level.” The ATSB recovered the aircraft's cockpit voice recorder, but found no audio from the accident flight, only audio from a previously flight in the United States. The investigation will also look into this issue. According to Cirium fleets data, the aircraft was delivered new to the US Navy in 1981. It later served with NASA for experimental work from 1992 to 1993, at which point it was placed in storage. Coulson acquired it in 2017 and converted the aircraft to perform aerial firefighting work.

"While Asian airlines have borne the brunt of the coronavirus crisis so far, US carriers are closely monitoring the situation, and will likely take a short-term hit as the US government sends mixed messages and bookings begin declining. As of 27 February, 47 countries on all continents except Antarctica have been affected by the virus, also called COVID-19. More than 81,000 people have been infected, and 2,800 deaths have been registered, most of those in mainland China, according to the World Health Organization. “[The coronavirus] is going to hit US carriers the least,” says consultant Mike Boyd of Boyd Aviation international said on Wednesday. “The majority of revenues are domestic, and the US is actually taking this very seriously. Other airlines are international in revenue streams and that means one strange cough from a guy in Warsaw, and flights might get zapped.” Major US airlines have cancelled many flights to China and Hong Kong, and Delta Air Lines and Hawaiian Airlines on Tuesday suspended flights to South Korea as well, where authorities have reported almost 2,000 cases alone. Hawaiian cited a decline in demand for the flights, making it financially unviable to operate them. All US carriers with scheduled flights to Japan and Italy – two other coronavirus hotspots which reported large outbreaks in past weeks - are currently still flying there. But reported coronavisus cases in those countries are growing. Among US carriers, United Airlines is most exposed to Japan, carrying 245,000 seats between the countries in both directions in February, Cirium schedules data shows. Delta will carry 132,000 seats on US-Japan routes this month, Hawaiian will carry 81,000 and American Airlines will carry 55,000. To Italy, Delta leads US airlines, carrying 37,000 seats between the countries this month, following by American and United, Cirium schedules data shows. Both American and United say on Thursday they have made no further adjustments to schedules, though they, along with low-cost carrier JetBlue Airways, are offering waivers and refunds for selected routes and cancelled flights, as well as for passengers who wish to change their travel plans. Aerospace analyst Michel Merluzeau with consultantcy AIR suspects the coronavirus could potentially have significant short-term impacts on the airline and aerospace industry, but thinks the industry's broader, long-term prospects remain unchanged and positive, noting underlying demand for air travel and a growing middle class. “If there is any disruption, it's going to be short-term disruption,” Merluzeau says. “For Airbus and Boeing, this is going to be a six-month blip of uncertainty that doesn't take anything away from the larger trend.” Boyd notes that the US and China are the only two markets where airlines' primary revenue is from domestic traffic. “China...is a mess. When this situation settles, our forecasts indicate at least 400 million fewer passengers through China's airports, and the Chinese airline system stuck with 150-200 excess airplanes. No snapback – the bubble is bursting, and it's also affected by the creaking Chinese economy.” On Tuesday, United suspended its 2020 earnings guidance after it stopped all flights to mainland China and Hong Kong until at least 24 April. According to Cirium schedules data, United operates the most routes to mainland China and Hong Kong among US majors (nine routes to mainland China from the USA and two routes to Hong Kong). The China and Hong Kong routes represent approximately 5% of United's planned capacity for 2020, with its other trans-Pacific routes representing an additional 10% of its planned capacity. Southwest Airlines does not fly to any Asian destinations, but its wide network across the western United States connects to locations where US cases have been reported. In addition, it caters primarily to leisure travelers who may be more likely to cancel discretionary travel as the crisis drags on. A spokesman says that the airline's experts “are keeping apprised in real-time of CDC guidance, always are engaged in contingency planning, and utmost are focused on the safety of our customers and employees.” Aircraft lessors and other leisure carriers like Spirit Airlines, Allegiant Air and Frontier Airlines could face more of an impact than major US network carriers since leisure travelers will be more likely to scrap discretionary plans, says Merluzeau. “We are going to see, over the next 60 days, unpredictable [airline] schedules driven by the fact that people are going to start cancelling their trips,” Merluzeau adds. “Delta, American, United, they are more resilient because they are more diverse in terms of their customer base.” On Wednesday, the US government announced a coronavirus task force designed to keep tabs on the spread of the disease, but in the past few days, government experts have been inconsistent in messages about the potential spread as well as making contingency plans and taking protective measures. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a warning earlier this week that outbreaks of coronavirus in the USA are inevitable, however top government officials dispute those expectations. Meantime, European carriers have taken more drastic measures. Budapest-based Wizz Air and British Airways are cutting their capacity to Italy, where 17 people have died, while Lufthansa Group is freezing new hiring and offering staff unpaid leave. IATA, which represents 290 carriers comprising 82% of global air traffic, said in a statement last week that carriers outside of the Asia-Pacific region are forecast to bear a revenue loss of $1.5 billion, assuming the loss of demand is limited to markets linked to China. “This would bring total global lost revenue to $29.3 billion (5% lower passenger revenues compared to what IATA forecast in December) and represent a 4.7% hit to global demand,” the lobby group said. The only blueprint for this type of situation was the SARS outbreak in 2003, which hit Asian economies but did not have strong ripple effects around the world that the coronavirus is having now. However, analysts note, total air traffic to, from, and in Asia today is considerably greater than it was 17 years ago, and social media was not then a factor in the rapid dissemination of information. “The group thinking and the hysteria and paranoia is really, fundamentally the most disruptive” factor of the current crisis, Merluzeau says. He warns that a fresh outbreak in a US city with a major aerospace cluster could significantly impact US aerospace production. “If you got a cluster of contamination that happens in Seattle...people could stop [coming] to work,” Merluzeau says. “Entire communities could be put under quarantine.” IATA's estimates are based upon a similar V-shaped impact on demand as was experienced during SARS – a six-month period with a sharp decline followed by an equally quick recovery. In 2003, SARS was responsible for the 5.1% fall in Asia-Pacific airlines' revenue passenger kilometres (RPKs).

"UK freighter operator CargoLogicAir has confirmed to FlightGlobal sister publicationAir Cargo Newsthat it has suspended operations as its exposure to China takes its toll. In a short statement, the Boeing 747 carrier – and the UK's only maindeck freighter operator – said that “due to the latest market development, specifically the drastic decrease of the market demand, CLA finds it extremely difficult to continue its commercial operations”. “Most importantly, CLA operations have been severely affected as it had placed a significant portion of its commercial activities in the Chinese market,” it adds. “As a result, a decision was made to suspend the flights.” The China market has taken a hit as result of the trade war with the USA and more recently the outbreak of the coronavirus that has seen factories extend Chinese New Year closures as part of efforts to contain the outbreak. London Stansted-baed CLA has requested a three-month suspension of its operating licence and air operator's certificate from 27 February, says the UK Civil Aviation Authority. CLA says it will would continue to fulfil its contractual, financial and regulatory obligations and added that it is in close communication with the CAA. Flight-tracking data, while unverified, indicated that the airline's freighters had stopped flying earlier this month. The airline has been active for around four years and its story is a mirror of the cargo industry over that time. Its first flights took place in early 2016, just ahead of the air cargo industry entering into a bumper 24-month period. At its height the airline operated a fleet of four 747Fs – three -400s and one -8F – and employed around 200 people. But over the past two years the situation has declined, with CLA cancelling freighter connections from Frankfurt to Chicago O'Hare, Atlanta, Chicago via Atlanta and Oslo, and services from Moscow-Sheremetyevo to Hong Kong. It subsequently revealed it would halve its fleet in early 2020 to two aircraft as it battled “challenging market conditions”. CLA's most recent full-year financial figures, for 2018, show its revenues almost doubled – to £213.7 million – but net losses deepened sharply to £18 million with a similar figure for its operating loss.",2,617,4.0,0.1486,"airport, fleet, service, data, carrier, operation, passenger, number, operate, operator","['uk', 'freighter', 'operator', 'cargologicair', 'confirm', 'flightglobal', 'sister', 'publicationair', 'cargo', 'newsthat', 'suspend', 'operation', 'exposure', 'take', 'toll', 'short', 'statement', 'carrier', 'uk', 'maindeck', 'freighter', 'operator', 'say', 'due', 'late', 'market', 'development', 'specifically', 'drastic', 'decrease', 'market', 'demand', 'cla', 'find', 'extremely', 'difficult', 'continue', 'commercial', 'operation', 'importantly', 'cla', 'operation', 'severely', 'affected', 'place', 'significant', 'portion', 'commercial', 'activity', 'chinese', 'market', 'add', 'result', 'decision', 'make', 'suspend', 'market', 'take', 'hit', 'result', 'trade', 'war', 'usa', 'recently', 'outbreak', 'coronavirus', 'see', 'factory', 'extend', 'chinese', 'closure', 'part', 'effort', 'contain', 'outbreak', 'london', 'stanstedbaed', 'cla', 'request', 'threemonth', 'suspension', 'operating', 'licence', 'operator', 'certificate', 'february', 'say', 'uk', 'civil', 'authority', 'cla', 'say', 'continue', 'fulfil', 'contractual', 'financial', 'regulatory', 'obligation', 'add', 'close', 'communication', 'caa', 'flighttracking', 'data', 'unverified', 'indicate', 'freighter', 'stop', 'fly', 'earlier', 'month', 'active', 'around', 'story', 'mirror', 'cargo', 'industry', 'take', 'place', 'early', 'ahead', 'cargo', 'industry', 'enter', 'bumper', 'period', 'height', 'operate', 'fleet', 'employ', 'around', 'people', 'past', 'situation', 'decline', 'cla', 'cancel', 'freighter', 'connection', 'frankfurt', 'chicago', 'atlanta', 'chicago', 'via', 'atlanta', 'oslo', 'service', 'moscowsheremetyevo', 'hong', 'kong', 'subsequently', 'reveal', 'halve', 'fleet', 'early', 'battle', 'challenge', 'market', 'condition', 'cla', 'recent', 'fullyear', 'financial', 'figure', 'revenue', 'almost', 'double', 'net', 'loss', 'deepen', 'sharply', 'similar', 'figure', 'operating', 'loss']"
"Dassault chief executive Eric Trappier regrets the breakdown of the UK-France defence partnership that would have seen his company team with BAE Systems on a next-generation unmanned combat air vehicle, saying a “political decision” was behind last year's launch of the Franco-German Future Combat Air System initiative. Dassault and BAE began collaborating after the Lancaster House agreement in 2010 between then president Nicolas Sarkozy and prime minister David Cameron. However, following the UK's vote to leave the EU in 2016, pressure grew for Paris and Berlin to develop an alternative solution. Last year, both governments announced that Dassault and Airbus Defence & Space would lead the initiative, along with companies including MBDA, Safran, Thales, and Indra of Spain, which is also to join the partnership. Trappier does not rule out an eventual merger between Franco-German efforts and the UK-Italian-Swedish Tempest project, launched at the 2018 Farnborough air show, and a “reaction”, he says, to the decision by France and Germany. However, he admits that “to stop the train [in the short- to medium-term] will be difficult”. He welcomes January's formal go-ahead for the Franco-German effort, which had originally been planned for 2018. “It took a certain time to achieve, but what is important is that we now have a concrete contract. It's now real work.” Speaking at Dassault's annual results presentation in Paris on 27 February, Trappier confirmed that the company's Rafale backlog stands at 75 units, with 47 of these allocated for export customers and 28 for France. Dassault delivered a total of 26 Rafales in 2019, all for export. Following this spike in activity it expects to hand over 13 examples to international buyers this year, with the next French deliveries to take place between 2022 and 2024.",2,618,0.0,0.2404,"order, business, jet, delivery, production, customer, deliver, commercial, quarter, include","['dassault', 'chief', 'executive', 'eric', 'trappier', 'regret', 'breakdown', 'ukfrance', 'defence', 'partnership', 'see', 'team', 'bae', 'system', 'nextgeneration', 'unmanned', 'combat', 'vehicle', 'say', 'political', 'decision', 'behind', 'launch', 'francogerman', 'future', 'combat', 'system', 'initiative', 'dassault', 'bae', 'begin', 'collaborate', 'lancaster', 'house', 'agreement', 'president', 'nicolas', 'sarkozy', 'prime', 'minister', 'david', 'cameron', 'however', 'follow', 'uk', 'vote', 'leave', 'eu', 'pressure', 'grow', 'paris', 'berlin', 'develop', 'alternative', 'solution', 'government', 'announce', 'dassault', 'defence', 'space', 'lead', 'initiative', 'along', 'include', 'mbda', 'safran', 'thales', 'indra', 'spain', 'join', 'partnership', 'trappier', 'rule', 'eventual', 'merger', 'francogerman', 'effort', 'ukitalianswedish', 'tempest', 'project', 'launch', 'farnborough', 'reaction', 'say', 'decision', 'france', 'germany', 'however', 'admits', 'stop', 'train', 'short', 'mediumterm', 'difficult', 'welcome', 'january', 'formal', 'goahead', 'francogerman', 'effort', 'originally', 'plan', 'take', 'certain', 'achieve', 'important', 'concrete', 'contract', 'real', 'speak', 'dassault', 'annual', 'result', 'presentation', 'paris', 'february', 'trappier', 'confirm', 'rafale', 'backlog', 'stand', 'unit', 'allocate', 'export', 'customer', 'france', 'dassault', 'deliver', 'total', 'rafales', 'export', 'follow', 'spike', 'activity', 'expect', 'hand', 'example', 'international', 'buyer', 'next', 'french', 'delivery', 'take', 'place']"
"AirAsia Grouphas reported a full-year net loss of MYR286 million ($67.9 million) for 2019, after a MYR1.7 billion net profit the previous year. The airline group says the negative result was due partly to “accounting treatment” associated with its move from owning to leasing aircraft, and partly to losses atAirAsia India.  Revenue rose 17% to MYR12.4 billion. The group narrowed its fourth-quarter net loss to MYR385 million from MYR457 million in the corresponding period of 2018. Fourth-quarter revenue was up 19% at MYR3.4 billion. AirAsia Philippines unit “turned profitable” in 2019 while losses narrowed at AirAsia Indonesia, the group notes. Acting chief executive Bo Lingam acknowledges that the coronavirus outbreak has made for a “challenging start to 2020”, but says the group is in a good position to recover quickly. “We continue to monitor the developments and have put in place proactive mitigating actions to limit the downside impact from COVID-19,” he states. “This includes active capacity management since early February, aggressive marketing push to pursue market share, redeploying capacity to domestic and intra-Asean flights as well as engaging and collaborating with industry stakeholders and authorities for incentives, discounts and rebates. “With our proactive approach in managing the situation through these measures, in addition to stricter implementation of internal cost control, we believe we will recover as soon as possible and come out stronger, as we have shown in previous aviation shocks.”",2,619,3.0,0.2688,"passenger, loss, operating, revenue, traffic, month, increase, capacity, decline, result","['airasia', 'grouphas', 'report', 'fullyear', 'net', 'loss', 'net', 'profit', 'previous', 'say', 'negative', 'result', 'due', 'partly', 'accounting', 'treatment', 'associate', 'move', 'lease', 'partly', 'loss', 'atairasia', 'india', 'revenue', 'rise', 'narrow', 'fourthquarter', 'net', 'loss', 'correspond', 'period', 'fourthquarter', 'revenue', 'airasia', 'philippine', 'unit', 'turn', 'profitable', 'loss', 'narrow', 'airasia', 'indonesia', 'note', 'act', 'chief', 'executive', 'bo', 'lingam', 'acknowledges', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'make', 'challenge', 'start', 'say', 'good', 'position', 'recover', 'quickly', 'continue', 'monitor', 'development', 'put', 'place', 'proactive', 'mitigate', 'action', 'limit', 'downside', 'impact', 'coronavirus', 'state', 'include', 'active', 'capacity', 'management', 'since', 'early', 'february', 'aggressive', 'marketing', 'push', 'pursue', 'market', 'share', 'redeploy', 'capacity', 'domestic', 'intraasean', 'well', 'engage', 'collaborate', 'industry', 'stakeholder', 'authority', 'incentive', 'discount', 'rebate', 'proactive', 'approach', 'manage', 'situation', 'measure', 'addition', 'stricter', 'implementation', 'internal', 'cost', 'control', 'believe', 'recover', 'soon', 'possible', 'come', 'strong', 'previous', 'shock']"
"Dassault Aviation is promising to reveal more details about its “Future Falcon” business jet by June, as it prepares to take on new launches from rivals Bombardier and Gulfstream. However, speaking at the company's annual results presentation in Paris today, chief executive Eric Trappier refused to be drawn on a precise launch date, or what segment the type will serve, other than to confirm that its mission will be “different to the 6X”. The 6X, Dassault's in-development twinjet, which is due to fly in the first quarter of 2021, has a range of 5,500nm (10,200km). Dassault is also holding firm to its forecast for 40 Falcon deliveries this year despite growing concerns about the impact of coronavirus and other economic headwinds on the business aviation sector. In 2019, the French airframer shipped five fewer examples than its original forecast of 45. Its Falcon backlog stood at 53 at the end of December. Trappier says Dassault's “first target” is to have the Pratt & Whitney Canada PW812D-powered 6X ready to fly in quarter one next year and enter service in 2022. He admits that the decision to abandon the previous 5X programme in 2017 after problems with the Safran Silvercrest engine set the company's fortunes back several years. “Obviously we lost what we had in the book for the 5X, but we would have continued to get more orders since 2017, so we are suffering because we do not have that in the inventory,” he says. Noting that the PW812 is now being tested and the first units for the 6X are being assembled, he adds: “Our focus now is being on time for 2022. We are confident as the engine is on time.” Trappier also says the new Falcon will be the first to be designed totally using the 3DExperience software platform from sister company Dassault Systemes.",2,620,0.0,0.3489,"order, business, jet, delivery, production, customer, deliver, commercial, quarter, include","['dassault', 'promising', 'reveal', 'detail', 'future', 'falcon', 'business', 'jet', 'june', 'prepares', 'take', 'launch', 'rival', 'bombardier', 'gulfstream', 'however', 'speak', 'annual', 'result', 'presentation', 'paris', 'today', 'chief', 'executive', 'eric', 'trappier', 'refuse', 'drawn', 'precise', 'launch', 'date', 'segment', 'type', 'serve', 'confirm', 'mission', 'different', 'dassault', 'indevelopment', 'twinjet', 'due', 'fly', 'quarter', 'range', 'dassault', 'hold', 'firm', 'forecast', 'falcon', 'delivery', 'despite', 'grow', 'concern', 'impact', 'coronavirus', 'economic', 'headwind', 'business', 'sector', 'french', 'airframer', 'ship', 'example', 'original', 'forecast', 'falcon', 'backlog', 'stood', 'end', 'december', 'trappier', 'say', 'dassault', 'target', 'pratt', 'whitney', 'canada', 'ready', 'fly', 'quarter', 'next', 'enter', 'service', 'admits', 'decision', 'abandon', 'previous', 'programme', 'problem', 'safran', 'silvercrest', 'engine', 'set', 'fortune', 'back', 'several', 'obviously', 'lose', 'book', 'continued', 'get', 'order', 'since', 'suffer', 'inventory', 'say', 'note', 'test', 'unit', 'assemble', 'add', 'focus', 'confident', 'engine', 'trappier', 'say', 'falcon', 'design', 'totally', 'use', 'software', 'platform', 'sister', 'dassault', 'systemes']"
"Hawaiian Airlines says it is suspending flights to Seoul Incheon International airport in South Korea, becoming the second US carrier to stop flying to the country since the outbreak of the coronavirus, also known as COVID-19, several weeks ago. Earlier in the day, Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines said it was suspending its Minneapolis/St. Paul to Seoul flight beginning on 29 February, and reduced to five-times weekly its flights to Seoul from Atlanta, Detroit and Seattle through 30 April. Delta's Atlanta and Detroit routes to Seoul normally operate daily, Cirium schedules data shows. The airline's Minneapolis/St Paul and Seattle routes to Seoul usually operate six-times weekly. “We believe a temporary service suspension is prudent given the escalation of COVID-19 in South Korea and the impact the illness has had on demand for leisure travel from that country,” says Peter Ingram, Hawaiian's president and chief executive. “We will continue to closely monitor the situation and extend our support for public health efforts to contain the virus. We apologise for this inconvenience and are working to support impacted guests.” Hawaiian operates non-stop service from its home airport Honolulu to Seoul five times a week, using an Airbus A330-200 on the route. The suspension of the flight will begin on 2 March and run through 30 April, the airline says. It has issued travel waivers to passengers departing to, from, or connecting through airports in Korea on codeshare flights. As of early Wednesday, South Korea has reported 1,200 cases of the virus. ”This Hawaiian move is a sound one,” says Mike Boyd, president and CEO of Boyd Group International. “Now with hundreds of infected people, the bookings on any airline to Korea are going to be near zero. This is particularly true with leisure traffic – which is likely the vast majority going between Hawaii and Korea.” US carriers are being prudent and taking the crisis seriously, he added. Most of the US airlines' revenues come from domestic operations, and the virus is likely to hit them least. Also on Wednesday, several European carriers said they were taking measures to reduce costs due to the virus. Lufthansa Group is implementing a hiring freeze and offering staff unpaid leave. While the airline group says it is too early to estimate the earnings impact, its network operators Lufthansa, Swiss and Austrian Airlines have cancelled all flights to mainland China until the end of March and adjusted capacity to Hong Kong. Lufthansa says this is the equivalent of having 13 aircraft grounded. United Airlines, which suspended flights from its US hubs to mainland China and Hong Kong through 24 April, withdrew its earnings guidance for 2020 earlier in the week, as it assesses the effects the virus will have on its business. The China and Hong Kong routes represent approximately 5% ofUnited's planned capacity for 2020, with its other trans-Pacific routes representing an additional 10% of its planned capacity.

"Iranian investigators believe failure to switch an Iran Air ATR 72-600's avionics to follow a new approach resulted in the aircraft's landing on the wrong runway following a service to Tabriz. The aircraft, arriving from Baku as IR779 on 10 February, had been conducting an approach with clearance for runway 30L. But the aircraft instead landed on the parallel runway 30R, says the Iranian Civil Aviation Organisation. The ATR (EP-ITM) had descended to 17,000ft and been told to expect the ILS1 arrival pattern to 30R. Its crew requested information on the runway condition and, based on the better braking data, sought instead the ILS2 approach to 30L. But the inquiry states that the crew failed to configure the avionics to follow the switched approach path. Despite the subsequent air-ground communications confirming the 30L approach, the ATR ultimately landed on 30R. The two runways are separated by less than 190m. The inquiry says that the 30R runway lights were turned off at the time, to assist the crew, although cockpit-voice recorder information confirms the crew observed precision-approach path indicator lamps. The lamps are located between the two runways. While the first officer sought to go around, owing to the runway lights being off, the aircraft proceeded to land. “Lack of effective communication between the two pilots is evident,” the inquiry states.",2,622,7.0,0.4993,"crew, runway, inquiry, land, approach, accident, investigator, captain, incident, pilot","['iranian', 'investigator', 'believe', 'failure', 'switch', 'iran', 'atr', 'avionics', 'follow', 'approach', 'result', 'land', 'wrong', 'runway', 'follow', 'service', 'tabriz', 'arrive', 'baku', 'february', 'conduct', 'approach', 'clearance', 'runway', 'instead', 'land', 'parallel', 'runway', 'say', 'iranian', 'civil', 'organisation', 'atr', 'epitm', 'descend', 'told', 'expect', 'arrival', 'pattern', 'crew', 'request', 'information', 'runway', 'condition', 'base', 'well', 'brake', 'data', 'sought', 'instead', 'approach', 'inquiry', 'state', 'crew', 'fail', 'configure', 'avionics', 'follow', 'switch', 'approach', 'path', 'despite', 'subsequent', 'airground', 'communication', 'confirm', 'approach', 'atr', 'ultimately', 'land', 'runway', 'separate', 'less', 'inquiry', 'say', 'runway', 'light', 'turn', 'assist', 'crew', 'although', 'cockpitvoice', 'recorder', 'information', 'confirms', 'crew', 'observe', 'precisionapproach', 'path', 'indicator', 'lamp', 'lamp', 'locate', 'runway', 'officer', 'sought', 'go', 'around', 'owe', 'runway', 'light', 'proceed', 'land', 'lack', 'effective', 'communication', 'pilot', 'evident', 'inquiry', 'state']"
"South Africa's government has set aside R16.4 billion ($1.1 billion) over the medium term for South African Airways to repay guaranteed debt and to cover debt-service costs. The national treasury has disclosed the figure in its newly-released 2020 budget review. It states that the government also anticipates that additional funding will be required to cover restructuring costs, following SAA's placement under business rescue. SAA has incurred net losses of more than R32 billion in the past decade, while those of regional operator SA Express – also under business rescue – have reached R1.2 billion over the same period. The government will need to “assess its appetite” for continued ownership of SA Express, says the review, given its “limited role” in the local aviation market. In an effort to progress towards fiscal sustainability the government has cut the baseline of budget expenditure by R156.1 billion over the next three years – the equivalent of about 1% of GDP per year – compared with 2019 budget projections. Increased support to financially-distressed state-owned companies – including SAA and energy firm Eskom – has increased by R60.1 billion over the medium term, it says, adding to the government's spending pressures. The government has set aside R16.4 billion for SAA to repay guaranteed debt and interest costs over the next three years. “Costs of this adjustment are still being finalised, and will be financed from existing provisional allocations for state-owned companies,” says the budget review. It points out that the market attaches increased risk to state-owned companies, which are paying “substantially more” to borrow – with the highest cost for guaranteed debt.

"The price of jet kerosene is continuing to move sharply lower in line with weaker crude, amid mounting concerns about the impact of the coronavirus on global economic growth. A tonne of jet kerosene for barge delivery to Rotterdam on 25 February was assessed at $501.75 per tonne, according to energy data provider ICIS – a reduction of $29.25 over one week. At the start of the year, the same delivery of jet kerosene would have been priced at around $660 per tonne. “European jet kerosene spot market continues to bear the brunt of coronavirus outbreak as flight cancellations are not only seeing reduced consumption rates but also inducing length in the market,” notes ICIS, which is a corporate sibling of Cirium's, within RELX. “While prices have continued downwards trajectory, staying at two-year lows, amid limited buying interest seen, additional supplies from East are likely to hit the region providing further downside.” Similar downward pressure is being seen in US markets. Kerosene prices for barge delivery to New York harbour have declined to 153-153.25 US cents per gallon from 171.50-171.75 four weeks ago. ICIS says the spread of coronavirus is the largest factor influencing crude prices in the near term. Prices are continuing to decline as the outbreak's impact is increasingly felt outside China. Asia is currently well-supplied with product because of the shutdown of economic activity in China, from which it is likely that an additional 2 million tonnes of jet kerosene will be routed west, one major airline has told ICIS, as higher prices in Europe have opened a fuel arbitrage. Jet-fuel buyers in Asia have stepped into the market in recent days, tempted by low prices, but this has not prevented prices from declining further. Barge deliveries of jet fuel to Singapore are assessed in the range of $62.72-63.12 per barrel, a reduction of $1.28 over a week, and down from $66.78-67.18 per barrel four weeks ago. At the start of 2020, they were assessed at over $80 per barrel. “With winter drawing to a close, no further support is expected from the heating kerosene market.

"Thai AirAsia's parent company posted an operating loss of Bt100 million ($3.14 million) for the whole of 2019, as costs outpaced revenues. This contrasts with a Bt660 million operating profit in 2018. Asia Aviation's revenue for the year ended 31 December 2019 rose 3% to Bt41.6 billion. The company attributed this to a 3% increase in passenger numbers, even as average fares remained flat while load factor was unchanged at 85%. Expenses were up by 5% to Bt41.7 billion, primarily due to higher costs associated with operating more flights and increased labour costs, the company said in its management and discussion analysis for the year. Net loss came in at Bt474 million, reversing last year's Bt70 million net profit. During the year, revenue per ASK fell 4% to Bt1.49. Unit cost declined 2% to Bt1.55, but excluding fuel, this was up by 3% to Bt1.03. In its outlook for 2020, Asia Aviation sees the greatest impact from fluctuation in fuel prices, foreign exchange, and interest rates. It also noted that revenue from international routes “remained under pressure” in the fourth quarter of 2019 as the Thai baht appreciated against the Chinese yuan, among other currencies. Thai AirAsia has since revised its 2020 passenger target downwards to 20.5 million, “to align with the situation of the [coronavirus] outbreak,” alongside a load factor of 84%. To manage the situation, the airline is adjusting flights according to demand, while implementing cost saving initiatives. Referring to a 10-aircraft deal with Avolon announced in January, the airline says it has completed transactions on four aircraft, with the remaining six to close within the first quarter of 2020. Separately, Thai AirAsia says it has received its IATA Operational Safety Audit (IOSA) certification. It is the fourth AirAsia Group carrier to pass the safety audit, after Malaysia AirAsia, Philippines AirAsia, and Indonesia AirAsia gained certification in 2018.

"The Federal Aviation Administration intends to prohibit 737 Max flights until each aircraft undergoes inspections related to risks posed by lightning strikes. The agency on 25 February proposed an order related to the lightning concern, which differs from the flight control software issue that has left the Max grounded since last March.  The proposed order says inadequate “electrical bonding” of panels atop the 737 Max's CFM International Leap-1B turbofans could allow a lightning strike to disable both the Max's engines. Electric bonding protects critical systems from lightning strikes. The issue does not affect 737NGs, says the FAA. “We are coordinating with our customers to complete the work prior to safe return to service,” Boeing says. The company in December 2019 issued a service bulletin in which it recommended inspections and a fix. But Boeing's bulletin only applied to some 737 Max and suggested airlines complete the work within six months. The FAA proposal, however, would require inspections on all 737 Max 8 and 737 Max 9 aircraft “before further flight”. “The proposed compliance time is based on the potential for a common-cause failure of both engines,” says the FAA's proposal. “This condition, if not addressed, could result in a forced off-airport landing or excessive flight crew workload due to loss of thrust control on both engines.” The FAA says the work would impose nominal costs on airlines because Boeing will cover it under warrantees. “Certain exterior fairing panels on the top of the engine nacelle and strut (the thumbnail fairing and mid-strut fairing panels) may not have the quality of electrical bonding necessary to ensure adequate shielding of the underlying wiring from the electromagnetic effects of lightning strikes or high-intensity radiated fields,” the proposal says. “Excessive rework” to the fairings can cause cuts in aluminium foil inside the fairings, it adds. “This metallic layer functions as part of the shielding for aircraft wiring, including wiring associated with the engine control systems.” Cuts to the foil could enable lightning strikes to cause “spurious signals” being sent through engine wires, potentially causing loss of control of one or both engines.

"Several carriers are suspending their operations to Iran in response to the ongoing coronavirus outbreak in the country. The United Arab Emirates has become the latest nation to ban flights to Iran. “All passenger and cargo aircraft traveling to and from Iran will be suspended for a period of one week, and could be up for extension,” the UAE's General Civil Aviation Authority is quoted as saying by the state-owned WAM news agency. “The decision is a precautionary measure undertaken by the UAE to ensure strict monitoring and prevention of the spread of the new coronavirus.” The UAE is a transit hub for Iranians given the restrictions placed on operations to their country by US sanctions. Emirates and Flydubai both operate to Iran. Cirium schedules data lists a total of 128 weekly flights in each direction between the two nations for February. Turkish Airlines said 24 February that it had ceased flying to all destinations in Iran bar Tehran until 10 March. The Star Alliance member has also extended its cancellation of services to mainland China until 29 February. “In addition, due to the decree of Turkey's official authorities, foreign citizens who were in China and Iran in the last 14 days will not be granted entry to Turkey,” it says. This represents 28 flights per week to Iran, Cirium data shows. Oman's civil aviation authority also took the step of temporarily suspending flights from 24 February, in addition to its decision to suspend flights to mainland China. Kuwait suspended flights to Iran on 20 February, the country's national airline says, and has now cancelled flights to Thailand and Italy. Iraq, Afghanistan, Georgia and Tajikistan have also reportedly cancelled flights to and from Iran. Iranian carriers have also been told to suspend flights to China. Combined, these seven countries plus Turkish Airlines' non-Tehran Iranian flights and Iranian carriers' flights to China represent a total of 724 each-way services per week, Cirium data shows, out of a total of 3,667 Iranian flights. Some 246 weekly flights were scheduled to operate from Iran to countries outside the Middle East, the majority to Turkey or Asia. A large proportion of these are now suspended. The impact of the restriction is relatively limited because US sanctions mean that few international carriers operate to Iran, with many other airlines have cancelled their services to the country after the shootdown of a Ukraine International Airlines jet outside Tehran in January. At least 15 people have now died from coronavirus in Iran, according to John Hopkins University tracking data, giving the country the highest death toll outside mainland China.",2,629,10.0,0.3069,"international, authority, civil, state, investigation, case, add, january, airasia, crash","['several', 'carrier', 'suspend', 'operation', 'iran', 'response', 'ongoing', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'country', 'united', 'arab', 'emirate', 'become', 'late', 'nation', 'ban', 'iran', 'passenger', 'cargo', 'travel', 'iran', 'suspend', 'period', 'week', 'extension', 'uae', 'general', 'civil', 'authority', 'quote', 'say', 'stateowned', 'wam', 'news', 'agency', 'decision', 'precautionary', 'measure', 'undertaken', 'uae', 'ensure', 'strict', 'monitoring', 'prevention', 'spread', 'uae', 'transit', 'hub', 'iranian', 'give', 'restriction', 'place', 'operation', 'country', 'u', 'sanction', 'emirate', 'flydubai', 'operate', 'iran', 'schedule', 'data', 'list', 'total', 'weekly', 'direction', 'nation', 'february', 'turkish', 'say', 'february', 'cease', 'fly', 'destination', 'iran', 'bar', 'tehran', 'march', 'star', 'alliance', 'member', 'extend', 'cancellation', 'service', 'mainland', 'february', 'addition', 'due', 'decree', 'turkey', 'official', 'authority', 'foreign', 'citizen', 'iran', 'day', 'grant', 'entry', 'turkey', 'say', 'represent', 'per', 'week', 'iran', 'data', 'oman', 'civil', 'authority', 'take', 'step', 'temporarily', 'suspend', 'february', 'addition', 'decision', 'suspend', 'mainland', 'kuwait', 'suspend', 'iran', 'february', 'country', 'national', 'say', 'cancel', 'thailand', 'italy', 'iraq', 'afghanistan', 'georgia', 'tajikistan', 'reportedly', 'cancel', 'iran', 'iranian', 'carrier', 'told', 'suspend', 'combine', 'country', 'plus', 'turkish', 'nontehran', 'iranian', 'iranian', 'carrier', 'represent', 'total', 'eachway', 'service', 'per', 'week', 'data', 'total', 'iranian', 'weekly', 'schedule', 'operate', 'iran', 'country', 'outside', 'middle', 'east', 'majority', 'turkey', 'asia', 'large', 'proportion', 'suspend', 'impact', 'restriction', 'relatively', 'limited', 'u', 'sanction', 'mean', 'international', 'carrier', 'operate', 'iran', 'many', 'cancel', 'service', 'country', 'shootdown', 'ukraine', 'international', 'jet', 'outside', 'tehran', 'january', 'least', 'people', 'die', 'coronavirus', 'iran', 'accord', 'john', 'hopkins', 'university', 'track', 'data', 'give', 'country', 'high', 'death', 'toll', 'outside', 'mainland']"

"The Transportation Safety Board of Canada (TSB) is investigating a landing gear issue and fire involving a Jazz Aviation turboprop in Montreal on 25 February. Jazz say no passengers or crew were injured in the incident, which occured after landing and involved a Jazz De Havilland of Canada Dash 8-300 arriving from Ottawa, according to FlightStats.com. The TSB is deploying an investigator following “an incident during the taxi phase of an Air Canada aircraft after landing”, the agency says. The TSB provides no additional details and did not respond immediately to requests for more information. Montreal-Trudeau airport also did not immediately respond to an inquiry.  A Jazz Dash 8 turboprop. In a statement, Halifax-based Jazz confirms the incident involved flight 8970, which was carrying 48 passengers and three crew. “After a normal landing and while taxiing at Montreal international airport, the aircraft operating Air Canada Express flight AC8970 experienced an issue with the right landing gear. As per our standard operational procedures the crew requested emergency vehicles meet the flight, as a precautionary measure – the safety of our passengers and crew is our top priority,” Jazz says. “The fire department inspected and cleared the aircraft and the passengers deplaned normally at the gate. Our maintenance personnel will conduct a thorough inspection of the aircraft to determine the cause and proceed with the necessary repairs.” “Flames were seen on taxiing to the gate and were quickly extinguished.

"US regulators have adopted new measures intended to improve pilot skills by providing leadership and mentoring training for captains, as well as opportunities for new-hire pilots to observe flight operations before becoming a crew member. The US FAA says the intention of the change, which also includes curriculum revision, is to “mitigate” incidents of “unprofessional pilot behaviour” and reduce the risk of potentially catastrophic errors. Its adoption follows proposals originally put forward over three years ago, and which have origins dating back more than 15 years. The FAA cites the fatal accident involving a Pinnacle Airlines Bombardier CRJ200 in October 2004 – attributed to poor airmanship, unprofessional behaviour and deviation from standard procedures – in its justification for establishing the new rules. Investigators noted at the time that the airline provided only 2h of leadership training during the upgrade to captaincy, and that there was a high initial upgrade failure rate. Pinnacle subsequently expanded the training to 8h with specific detailed modules, and substantially improved the upgrade rate. The FAA says a “problem still exists” within the industry with respect to some pilots not adhering to operating procedures including the 'sterile cockpit' – which requires crews to limit discussion and attention exclusively to aircraft operation below 10,000ft. Its amendments include additional carrier training for captains, including leadership and mentoring, and further qualification for new-hire pilots including operational familiarisation through sitting on the observer seat, with a headset, for at least two cycles. Recurrent leadership training for captains will be required every 36 months. But initial plans to require operators to establish and maintain a pilot professional development committee, to administer and oversee mentoring schemes, have been ditched. Little opposition was presented to the FAA over its general proposal, but a number of airline and pilot association respondents suggested changes, some of which have been incorporated into the final regulation. The rule becomes effective from 27 April.",2,633,11.0,0.379,"pilot, faa, issue, safety, include, report, require, training, ground, order","['u', 'regulator', 'adopt', 'measure', 'intend', 'improve', 'pilot', 'skill', 'provide', 'leadership', 'mentor', 'training', 'captain', 'well', 'opportunity', 'newhire', 'pilot', 'observe', 'operation', 'become', 'crew', 'member', 'u', 'faa', 'say', 'intention', 'change', 'include', 'curriculum', 'revision', 'mitigate', 'incident', 'unprofessional', 'pilot', 'behaviour', 'reduce', 'risk', 'potentially', 'catastrophic', 'error', 'adoption', 'follow', 'proposal', 'originally', 'put', 'forward', 'ago', 'origin', 'date', 'back', 'faa', 'cite', 'fatal', 'accident', 'involve', 'pinnacle', 'bombardier', 'october', 'attribute', 'poor', 'airmanship', 'unprofessional', 'behaviour', 'deviation', 'standard', 'procedure', 'justification', 'establish', 'rule', 'investigator', 'note', 'provide', 'leadership', 'training', 'upgrade', 'captaincy', 'high', 'initial', 'upgrade', 'failure', 'rate', 'pinnacle', 'subsequently', 'expand', 'training', 'specific', 'detailed', 'module', 'substantially', 'improve', 'upgrade', 'rate', 'faa', 'say', 'problem', 'still', 'exists', 'within', 'industry', 'respect', 'pilot', 'adhere', 'operating', 'procedure', 'include', 'cockpit', 'require', 'crew', 'limit', 'discussion', 'attention', 'exclusively', 'operation', 'amendment', 'include', 'additional', 'carrier', 'training', 'captain', 'include', 'leadership', 'mentor', 'far', 'qualification', 'newhire', 'pilot', 'include', 'operational', 'familiarisation', 'sit', 'observer', 'seat', 'headset', 'least', 'cycle', 'recurrent', 'leadership', 'training', 'captain', 'require', 'every', 'month', 'initial', 'plan', 'require', 'operator', 'establish', 'maintain', 'pilot', 'professional', 'development', 'committee', 'administer', 'oversee', 'mentor', 'scheme', 'ditch', 'little', 'opposition', 'present', 'faa', 'general', 'proposal', 'number', 'pilot', 'association', 'respondent', 'suggest', 'change', 'incorporate', 'final', 'regulation', 'rule', 'becomes', 'effective', 'april']"
"South African investigators have disclosed that a Cessna Citation II calibration aircraft suddenly entered a steep descent and excessive right bank before colliding with high terrain about 10min after departing George airport. None of the three occupants survived after the jet, operated by the South African Civil Aviation Authority, crashed into a mountainous slope at a height of 2,192ft above sea level. It had been performing an ILS calibration for runway 11 on 23 January, initial findings from the CAA inquiry state. This calibration required the aircraft to fly along a 70° clockwise arc – sweeping 35° either side of the centreline – at 17nm distance from the runway threshold. The jet had taken off from runway 11, turning right to head for the southern end of the arc, then turning right to follow it, tracking from radial 250 to about radial 330 relative to George airport. As the aircraft turned onto the arc over Mossel Bay it was flying at 3,000ft and – as it approach the higher terrain at around radial 310 – it began to climb towards 4,000ft. Preliminary flight-data recorder information reveals the aircraft levelled off at about 3,900ft and started banking to right at 35°. It then began to pitch nose-down, initially at about 10° but increasing over the space of 5s to more than 32°. The jet's airspeed rose to 275kt and its bank increased to an excessive level of 105° before reducing to 75°. During the rapid descent it lost some 1,500ft in the space of a few seconds, the inquiry says, reaching an altitude of 2,400ft. Recorder data shows the steep nose-down attitude was reduced to 17.5° and its right bank brought back to just 10°. The inquiry says that, 3s before the terrain collision, the aircraft's nose “pitched up”. But the jet was not carrying – nor was it required to carry – a cockpit-voice recorder, and investigators have been unable to determine whether its terrain-warning system sounded. Meteorological information from the South African Weather Service mentioned “significant” clouds at less than 1,500ft above ground level. Based on this information, says the inquiry, the mountain tops at the northern end of the calibration arc would have been “obscured” by cloud. Wreckage at the crash site indicates the aircraft struck an upslope terrain at a shallow angle and an airspeed of 286kt. The inquiry has given no indication as to the reason for the extreme roll and sudden descent. But the CAA is investigating an accident involving its own aircraft and has recommended that, given the circumstances, the South African transport ministry should consider whether the investigation ought to be delegated to a different investigation authority.",2,634,7.0,0.5656,"crew, runway, inquiry, land, approach, accident, investigator, captain, incident, pilot","['south', 'african', 'investigator', 'disclose', 'cessna', 'citation', 'ii', 'calibration', 'suddenly', 'enter', 'steep', 'descent', 'excessive', 'right', 'bank', 'collide', 'high', 'terrain', 'depart', 'george', 'airport', 'none', 'occupant', 'survive', 'jet', 'operate', 'south', 'african', 'civil', 'authority', 'crashed', 'mountainous', 'slope', 'height', 'sea', 'level', 'perform', 'il', 'calibration', 'runway', 'january', 'initial', 'finding', 'caa', 'inquiry', 'state', 'calibration', 'require', 'fly', 'along', 'clockwise', 'arc', 'sweep', 'either', 'side', 'centreline', 'distance', 'runway', 'threshold', 'jet', 'take', 'runway', 'turn', 'right', 'head', 'southern', 'end', 'arc', 'turn', 'right', 'follow', 'track', 'radial', 'radial', 'relative', 'george', 'airport', 'turn', 'onto', 'arc', 'mossel', 'bay', 'fly', 'approach', 'high', 'terrain', 'around', 'radial', 'begin', 'climb', 'towards', 'preliminary', 'flightdata', 'recorder', 'information', 'reveals', 'level', 'start', 'banking', 'right', 'begin', 'pitch', 'nosedown', 'initially', 'increase', 'space', 'jet', 'airspeed', 'rise', 'bank', 'increase', 'excessive', 'level', 'reduce', 'rapid', 'descent', 'lose', 'space', 'second', 'inquiry', 'say', 'reach', 'altitude', 'recorder', 'data', 'steep', 'nosedown', 'attitude', 'reduce', 'right', 'bank', 'brought', 'back', 'inquiry', 'say', 'terrain', 'collision', 'nose', 'pitch', 'jet', 'carry', 'require', 'carry', 'cockpitvoice', 'recorder', 'investigator', 'unable', 'determine', 'whether', 'terrainwarning', 'system', 'sound', 'meteorological', 'information', 'south', 'african', 'weather', 'service', 'mention', 'significant', 'cloud', 'less', 'ground', 'level', 'base', 'information', 'say', 'inquiry', 'mountain', 'top', 'northern', 'end', 'calibration', 'arc', 'obscure', 'cloud', 'wreckage', 'crash', 'site', 'indicates', 'struck', 'upslope', 'terrain', 'shallow', 'angle', 'airspeed', 'inquiry', 'give', 'indication', 'reason', 'extreme', 'roll', 'sudden', 'descent', 'caa', 'investigate', 'accident', 'involve', 'recommend', 'give', 'circumstance', 'south', 'african', 'transport', 'ministry', 'consider', 'whether', 'investigation', 'ought', 'delegate', 'different', 'investigation', 'authority']"
"Alitalia's new commissioner has detailed proposals for trimming part of the Italian carrier's operations, during meetings with key unions. Commissioner Giuseppe Leogrande took over as a single commissioner for the carrier, which remains in extraordinary administration, after plans fell through for a consortium of investors to take over the airline. Union FIT-CISL says Leogrande informed members of proposals to close unprofitable routes and reduce the fleet by three aircraft, from 113 to 110. The aircraft would be withdrawn through the end of leases. Union FILT-CGIL says the network closures would be aimed at long-haul routes. FILT-CGIL chief Fabrizio Cuscito says: “There was also talk of the possible impact of route closures on the extent of lay-offs for pilots and cabin crew.” But no details have been finalised, he adds. Cuscito warns that the need for sacrifices regarding Alitalia's reshaping “cannot fall again on workers”. FIT-CISL says the commissioner advised that the entire company is being examined for areas of improvement. But the union says the economic development minister needs to convene a meeting with the workers' representatives and “tell us what he wants to do with Alitalia”.

"The Federal Aviation Administration has agreed to pay the US government $90,000 to settle allegations it retaliated against a staffer who raised concerns about unqualified safety inspectors. Those inspectors' lack of training and of required certifications has called “into question the operational review of several aircraft, including the Boeing 737 Max and the Gulfstream GVII”, says the US Office of Special Counsel, an agency with investigation and prosecution authority. The GVII includes Gulfstream's G500 and G600 business jets.  The FAA certificated Gulfstream's G600, seen here, in 2019. “The whistleblower disclosed that flight inspectors were certifying pilots and conducting safety check rides even though they lacked the necessary formal training and certifications required to perform that oversight,” says the Special Counsel, which disclosed the FAA's settlement on 24 February. It adds that the FAA's Office of Audit and Evaluation has since substantiated the whistleblower's allegations, concluding that “after disclosing the problem, the whistleblower faced retaliation”. “After he made the disclosures, his managers also allegedly removed his duties and denied training requests, flight certifications, and job training opportunities,” the Special Counsel says. “The whistleblower decided to take a new position in another city in order to escape what he believed was pervasive harassment.” Boeing did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Gulfstream declines to specifically comment about the whistleblower's allegations or FAA's settlement, but notes its G500 and G600 jets have flown more than 9,000h and that the company has “a more than 60-year history of successfully developing pilot training materials”. The FAA certificated the G500 in 2018 and the G600 in 2019. The FAA says it “takes all whistleblower allegations seriously and does not tolerate retaliation against those who raise safety concerns”. In September 2019, following the FAA's investigation into the allegations, the Special Counsel told the US Congress and President Donald Trump that “the FAA's failure to ensure safety inspector competency for these aircraft puts the flying public at risk”. The FAA investigation found that 16 of 22 safety inspectors, including those as the FAA's Seattle Aircraft Evaluation Group, had not completed formal training. Eleven of the 16 inspectors lacked “flight instructor certificates, which are a basic position requirement”, the Special Counsel said last September.

"Senior executives at South Korea's Asiana Airlines have offered to take a pay cut to help the company through a rough patch. Chief executive Han Chang-soo has pledged to return 40% of his annual salary, while other executives and team leaders will return 30% and 20%, respectively. The leadership team have also submitted their collective resignation, though this is largely symbolic and unlikely to be accepted at this juncture. “The intention is that management will take the lead in overcoming the crisis,” Han states. Asiana faces a crisis due to a severe decline in air travel demand, Han notes, first from last year's diplomatic row between South Korea and Japan and then from this year's coronavirus outbreak. The company is acting to reduce costs and improve profitability, and its efforts are aligned with its three unions: the Asiana Airlines Pilot Labor Union, Asiana Airlines General Union, and Asiana Airlines Open Pilot Union. All staff have been asked to take 10 days of unpaid leave whileAsianaworks to “drastically reduce non-operating activities that are not directly related to profitability.” While minimising staffing levels across functions, the airline will reduce its number of routes to China, by 79%, and to Southeast Asia, by 25%. Cirium schedules data shows that from January to February, Asiana reduced capacity on routes to China about 50% and to Southeast Asia 10%, while total capacity was reduced 12%.

"Share prices in the three main European alliance carriers have fallen sharply in early trading, apparently in response to increasing concerns over the international spread of the coronavirus. While major European stock indices – including those in Germany, France, the Benelux states and the UK – slipped by around 3-4% as markets opened on 24 February, the impact on the airline stocks has been more substantial. Budget airlines, which rely heavily on short-haul operations within Europe, seemed to be affected particularly hard. EasyJet was down by more than 12% and Ryanair by over 10%, with Wizz Air stock falling 8.5%. Air France-KLM's stock dropped by more than 9% and that of Scandinavia's SAS fell by 8.5%. Lufthansa Group's share price similarly fell by nearly 8% while that for British Airways and Iberia parent IAG declined by more than 7%. Leisure company TUI Group has similarly suffered with stock down 8%. The spread of the coronavirus to European territories, particularly Italy, appears to have contributed to investors' agitation. Italy's government has approved new legislation introducing “urgent” actions, it says, to address the spread of the Covid-19 strain. The measures include “all appropriate containment measures” – including cutting off access – for municipalities in which the source of transmission is undetermined. The government detailed the decree on 23 February. Its defensive measures also limit the risk of spread by suspending demonstrations, events, and other public gatherings, closure of non-essential public facilities and services, such as museums, and quarantine of individuals who have come into contact with infected people. European health commissioner Stella Kyriakides says the situation in Italy has been followed “very closely”. While the number of coronavirus cases in the European Union is still low, she says: “These rapid developments over the past days confirm that the situation can change very quickly.” Daily contacts at technical level are taking place with the Italian authorities, the Commission, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and the World Health Organization's European arm to discuss the evolving situation. “We have asked the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control to update their risk assessment to take into consideration the developing situation in Italy and possible scenarios and actions that need to be taken in view of this,” says Kyriakides.",2,638,12.0,0.2502,"travel, government, country, coronavirus, measure, restriction, passenger, state, march, canada","['share', 'price', 'main', 'european', 'alliance', 'carrier', 'fall', 'sharply', 'early', 'trading', 'apparently', 'response', 'increase', 'concern', 'international', 'spread', 'coronavirus', 'major', 'european', 'stock', 'index', 'include', 'germany', 'france', 'benelux', 'state', 'uk', 'slip', 'around', 'market', 'open', 'february', 'impact', 'stock', 'substantial', 'budget', 'rely', 'heavily', 'shorthaul', 'operation', 'within', 'europe', 'seem', 'affected', 'particularly', 'hard', 'easyjet', 'ryanair', 'wizz', 'stock', 'fall', 'franceklm', 'stock', 'drop', 'scandinavia', 'sa', 'fell', 'lufthansa', 'share', 'price', 'similarly', 'fell', 'nearly', 'british', 'airway', 'iberia', 'parent', 'iag', 'decline', 'leisure', 'tui', 'similarly', 'suffer', 'stock', 'spread', 'coronavirus', 'european', 'territory', 'particularly', 'italy', 'appear', 'contribute', 'investor', 'agitation', 'italy', 'government', 'approve', 'legislation', 'introduce', 'urgent', 'action', 'say', 'address', 'spread', 'coronavirus', 'strain', 'measure', 'include', 'appropriate', 'containment', 'measure', 'include', 'cut', 'access', 'municipality', 'source', 'transmission', 'undetermined', 'government', 'detailed', 'decree', 'february', 'defensive', 'measure', 'limit', 'risk', 'spread', 'suspend', 'demonstration', 'event', 'public', 'gathering', 'closure', 'nonessential', 'public', 'facility', 'service', 'museum', 'quarantine', 'individual', 'come', 'contact', 'infect', 'people', 'european', 'health', 'commissioner', 'stella', 'kyriakides', 'say', 'situation', 'italy', 'follow', 'closely', 'number', 'coronavirus', 'case', 'european', 'union', 'still', 'low', 'say', 'rapid', 'development', 'past', 'day', 'confirm', 'situation', 'change', 'daily', 'contact', 'technical', 'level', 'take', 'place', 'italian', 'authority', 'commission', 'european', 'centre', 'disease', 'prevention', 'control', 'world', 'health', 'organization', 'european', 'arm', 'discus', 'evolve', 'situation', 'ask', 'european', 'centre', 'disease', 'prevention', 'control', 'update', 'risk', 'assessment', 'take', 'consideration', 'develop', 'situation', 'italy', 'possible', 'scenario', 'action', 'need', 'take', 'view', 'say', 'kyriakides']"
"Incorrectly calculated take-off speeds caused a Jetstar Airbus A320 to suffer flap and landing gear retraction overspeeds, Australian aviation safety investigators have revealed. Releasing the final investigation report into the 2018 incident, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) says the flight crew also did not independently verify and cross check their calculations. The flight crew were preparing for their flight from Sydney to Melbourne on the evening of 29 September 2018, their third leg in the day. “This incident highlights the importance of independent validation and cross-check of flight performance data, in particular performance speeds and aircraft weight” - ATSB transport safety director Stuart Godley During pre-flight preparation, the crew's electronic flight bags, which helped automate functions such as take-off speed calculations, were not updated at the start of the day, as stipulated by the carrier. As a result, when both crew members calculated the take-off performance data, they received inconsistent data. The first officer, the pilot monitoring, had updated his software before the flight, but the captain, the pilot flying, had an older software version. The captain was unable to update his software, so they decided to employ the back-up procedure: calculating speeds manually. The first officer “recalled that he performed the calculations” and that the captain “agreed with the results”.  The first officer “did not recall [the captain] independently performing the task”, the ATSB notes. Using manually-calculated data, the crew performed take off from Sydney later that night. Shortly after take off, the maximum flap extended speed was exceeded. Flight data also reveals that the crew did not make the “positive climb” and “gear up” calls, which were usual procedure. The first officer, who was monitoring, told his colleague that the aircraft was exceeding the maximum flap extended speed. A short while later, the overspeed warning was also triggered. The captain retarded thrust levers in response – instead of increasing the aircraft pitch – at an altitude of 144ft (43.9m) above ground level. The ATSB notes that this was below the safe thrust reduction altitude of 800ft. After the flaps were retracted, the crew reported hearing a “buffeting noise.” They initially attributed this to the aircraft's auxiliary power unit (APU) still being switched on and delivering bleed air. However, the noise continued after the APU was shut off and the crew realised that the landing gear was still extended. Flight data reveals that when the gear was retracted a retraction overspeed event occured. The aircraft continued on to Melbourne without further incident. There were no injuries recorded. In its safety analysis, the ATSB notes that the use of manual calculations was a “rarely practised” procedure by the crew. “It was unlikely the flight crew completed the full procedure for the manual calculation,” states the bureau. It found that the calculated rotation speed was based on an aircraft weight that was “significantly heavier” than the actual take-off weight. It adds that the reduction of speed below the safe altitude “had the potential to affect safety of the flight”. Following the incident, the ATSB notes that Jetstar has issued its own internal safety summary, with safety reminders to its flight crew. On the incident, ATSB transport safety director Stuart Godley says: “This incident highlights the importance of independent validation and cross-check of flight performance data, in particular performance speeds and aircraft weight.” “This investigation emphasises the importance of considering reasonability and accuracy checks, consulting company procedures manuals in the event of electronic flight bag issues, and conducting a normal rotation followed by reference to the Speed Reference System,” Godley adds. Cirium fleets data indicates that VH-VFX was delivered to the low-cost carrier in November 2013.

"AirAsia X is looking to delay lease rental payments to tide itself over during the coronavirus crisis, sources tell Cirium. An executive at one of the carrier's lessors tells Cirium that it is unlikely the company will allow AirAsia X to skip lease payments entirely but may be open to letting it postpone payments.  Another executive at a different lessor with exposure to the airline says this is not the first time that AirAsia X has asked for lease rental payment deferrals. The source says that his lessor values long-term relationships with its airline customers and will therefore be open to discussing deferrals with customers experiencing cash flow issues. However, he says “we are not a soft touch”, adding that, for example, a three-month rental holiday would not be acceptable. Cirium fleets data shows that AirAsia X has 17 Airbus A330-300s on lease, from Aircastle, BOC Aviation, Castlelake, DAE Capital, ICBC Leasing, Macquarie AirFinance, Minsheng Financial Leasing, Skyworks Leasing and Stratos.

"South Africa's auditor general's office has testified to the chaotic condition of South African Airways' organisation during a judicial commission examining allegations of corruption and fraud in state companies. The office participated for the first time in the audit of SAA's full-year financial statement covering 2016-17. SAA was experiencing liquidity problems and could not provide the office with the financial statements until October 2017, five months behind schedule. Auditor general business executive Polani Sokombela described as “quite dire” some aspects of SAA's organisation, and detailed multiple concerns picked up during its audit of the company's financial state. Sokombela told the inquiry on 21 February that the airline was experiencing “a lot of instability” at the time, with more than 40% of its executive committee positions filled in an acting capacity. There was no permanent chief executive, or head of finances, commercial activity, and strategy, and SAA did not have sufficient aviation specialists at board level. Nor did the carrier have enough individuals with “appropriate competencies” regarding preparation of financial statements, understanding of regulations for supply-chain management, or compliance with the South African treasury's framework on performance reporting. “That had a negative impact. We ended up having a lot of findings in those areas,” said Sokombela, adding that compliance with legislation was a “serious challenge” at SAA. The airline's annual report, he pointed out, admitted to irregular expenditure of R125 million, a sharp rise on the previous year's figure. But Sokombela says the auditor general's office could not find evidence of “consequence management” – namely any sanction against transgressors. He also pointed to a lack of capacity in the legal divisions tasked with overseeing SAA contract management. While successful suppliers were notified by letter when awarded a tender, he said, this was not always accompanied by a formal contract. “That, in our view, was a big risk for SAA,” said Sokombela. “Because if you don't have a contract signed with your suppliers, how are you going to control them?” He told the inquiry that this situation – with little control over quality or even existence of supply – had probably been “going on for quite some time”. SAA had a “very big” contract register, he said, but for the “majority” of them the auditor general's office “could not find the signed contracts”, meaning the credibility of the register was “questionable”. “When we were there and we looked at the state of affairs, it was quite dire,” he added. Sokombela described SAA's record-keeping as a “significant concern”, telling the inquiry that obtaining information would sometimes take three months. “This has resulted in significant limitations of scope on our side, due to that issue, especially in the areas of supply-chain management and also assets of SAA,” he said.

"Bell has revealed an experimental 429 helicopter with four electric-motor-powered tail rotors. The Electrically Distributed Anti-Torque (EDAT) tail rotors first flew on the light, twin-engined 429 helicopter in May 2019, says Bell on 21 February. The aircraft is being tested at the company's Mirabel, Canada facility and has about 25h of flight time. The EDAT tail rotor system stops moving once the aircraft is on the ground, reducing danger to bystanders, says Bell. It also costs less to operate, has fewer mechanical components and is significantly quieter. Moreover, because it is turboelectric-powered, instead of shaft-driven, it reduces the helicopter's carbon emissions, the company says. Rotors driven by electric motors might be advantageous for a number of other reasons too. Turboelectric hybrid systems are generally more efficient than pure jet turbine power, reducing fuel consumption. Power to electric motor-driven rotors can be controlled more precisely, which might make the system nimbler than a turboshaft-driven tail rotor. Electric motors can also increase power more quickly by drawing from a reserve of battery energy, compared to gas turbines. Fewer mechanical parts, in particular the tail rotor drive shaft and gears, might also save weight. A smaller number of mechanical parts also could reduce maintenance needs of an aircraft. Electric-powered rotors contained within fenestrons are less likely to be damaged should the helicopter's tail strike an object. Having four rotors also adds redundancy in case one blade should fail or be damaged. Turboelectric hybrid aircraft are getting a second look as aircraft manufacturers look for ways to reduce carbon emissions and improve fuel efficiency. The powerplants are also seen as a way to increase the range of nascent electric-vertical-take-off-and-landing rotorcraft.

BEA adds that a low-speed alarm was triggered. “The crew carried out a new approach and landed without further incident,” says the authority. It has yet to elaborate on the contributing circumstances to the incident. Cirium fleets data lists F-HREV as being leased from AerCap. The Rolls-Royce Trent XWB-powered aircraft was delivered to the airline, part of Groupe Debreuil, in March 2018.",2,643,7.0,0.3281,"crew, runway, inquiry, land, approach, accident, investigator, captain, incident, pilot","['french', 'investigator', 'probe', 'incident', 'involve', 'french', 'bee', 'goaround', 'paris', 'orly', 'twinjet', 'fhrev', 'conduct', 'approach', 'runway', 'february', 'follow', 'service', 'san', 'francisco', 'french', 'investigation', 'authority', 'bea', 'state', 'approach', 'aborted', 'owe', 'windshear', 'miss', 'approach', 'procedure', 'say', 'deviation', 'observe', 'head', 'altitude', 'bea', 'add', 'lowspeed', 'alarm', 'trigger', 'crew', 'carry', 'approach', 'land', 'without', 'far', 'incident', 'say', 'authority', 'yet', 'elaborate', 'contribute', 'circumstance', 'incident', 'fleet', 'data', 'list', 'fhrev', 'lease', 'aercap', 'rollsroyce', 'trent', 'xwbpowered', 'deliver', 'part', 'groupe', 'debreuil', 'march']"
"Kazakhstan's government has released an animation detailing the take-off sequence of the Bek Air Fokker 100 involved in a fatal accident at Almaty. The sequence clearly shows the difficulties the crew experienced in controlling the aircraft as it rotated from runway 05R while departing for Nur-Sultan on 27 December. It oscillates on lift-off but fails to gain altitude, striking the runway several times before overrunning and veering into a building. The airline recently issued, extraordinarily, purported audio conversations between accident investigators and the first officer of the flight, who initially survived the accident but subsequently passed away on 28 January, shortly after the discussion. Bek Air says the recordings were captured by the airline's employees who were present at the time. The transcript of the discussion includes question on how the crew checked the surface of the wings for ice, following suggestions that no check was conducted. But the first officer apparently replies that he made a tactile check in three places, pointing out that he was able to check the front of the wing – which was “clean and dry” – more easily because he was taller than the captain. He says the de-icing of the stabiliser – and only the stabiliser – was the captain's decision, because it could not be checked from the ground. The first officer also says that the aircraft was able to track the runway centreline during the departure but had passed the V1 decision speed when problems emerged, and the crew therefore did not consider aborting the take-off roll. Control difficulties began, he says, after the nose-wheel lifted. He retracted the landing-gear, but only on the second attempt – and after a second call from the captain – because the aircraft was rolling sharply.",2,644,7.0,0.3597,"crew, runway, inquiry, land, approach, accident, investigator, captain, incident, pilot","['kazakhstan', 'government', 'release', 'animation', 'detail', 'takeoff', 'sequence', 'bek', 'fokker', 'involve', 'fatal', 'accident', 'almaty', 'sequence', 'clearly', 'difficulty', 'crew', 'experienced', 'control', 'rotate', 'runway', 'depart', 'nursultan', 'december', 'oscillates', 'liftoff', 'fails', 'gain', 'altitude', 'strike', 'runway', 'several', 'overrun', 'veer', 'building', 'recently', 'issue', 'extraordinarily', 'purport', 'audio', 'conversation', 'accident', 'investigator', 'officer', 'initially', 'survive', 'accident', 'subsequently', 'pass', 'away', 'january', 'shortly', 'discussion', 'bek', 'say', 'recording', 'capture', 'employee', 'present', 'transcript', 'discussion', 'include', 'question', 'crew', 'checked', 'surface', 'wing', 'ice', 'follow', 'suggestion', 'check', 'conduct', 'officer', 'apparently', 'reply', 'make', 'tactile', 'check', 'place', 'point', 'able', 'check', 'front', 'wing', 'clean', 'dry', 'easily', 'taller', 'captain', 'say', 'deice', 'stabiliser', 'stabiliser', 'captain', 'decision', 'checked', 'ground', 'officer', 'say', 'able', 'track', 'runway', 'centreline', 'departure', 'pass', 'decision', 'speed', 'problem', 'emerge', 'crew', 'therefore', 'consider', 'abort', 'takeoff', 'roll', 'control', 'difficulty', 'begin', 'say', 'nosewheel', 'lift', 'retract', 'landinggear', 'second', 'attempt', 'second', 'call', 'captain', 'roll', 'sharply']"
"Kenyan investigators have disclosed that the crew of a Fokker 50 continued a take-off roll, despite multiple alerts apparently warning of a serious engine problem, before the aircraft crashed some 50s after becoming airborne. The inquiry into the accident, involving a Skyward International Aviation turboprop departing Nairobi's main international airport, found that 27 high-level 'triple-chime' alerts had sounded as the aircraft rolled along runway 06. Aural alerts had commenced as early as 8s after the take-off was initiated but, while the aircraft was well below the V1 decision speed, the crew did not act to abort the take-off roll. Flight-data recorder information indicates the left-hand Pratt & Whitney Canada PW125 engine was exhibiting problems, with increasing torque but declining propeller speed compared with the right-hand engine. “On [its] ground roll for take-off, the aircraft seemed to take [more] runway than anticipated before attaining the take-off speed,” the Kenyan air accident investigation department states, indicating that the roll lasted over 90s. The aircraft lifted off from the high-elevation airport at about 100kt but “barely climbing”, the inquiry says, reaching no more than 50ft above ground after about 20s while continually deviating to the left of the extended centreline. It subsequently collided with a building 2,100m north-north-east of the runway end. None of the four occupants – two pilots, an engineer and a loadmaster – survived. None of the four occupants survived after the Fokker 50 struck a building The aircraft had been conducting a cargo service to Mogadishu, in darkness, on 2 July 2014. Investigators found discrepancies in the loadsheet for the aircraft and analysis of the cargo, including a shipment of the mild narcotic qat, indicated that the aircraft was 500-1,500kg above its maximum certified gross weight at take-off. The captain, who had been flying, had logged over 6,800h in command of Fokker 50s, although the inquiry says it was “unable to determine” whether either pilot had demonstrated an ability to fly the turboprop with one engine inoperable. Analysis of recordings from the previous positioning flight by the aircraft (5Y-CET) showed a 'three-chime' alert had occurred, and that the crew spent time trying to diagnose the problem. Despite the evidence from the cockpit-voice recorder, the monitoring pilot for the flight “denied knowledge” of any anomalies, says the inquiry. Investigators could not obtain any evidence that any problem was recorded in the technical log, nor that any maintenance was conducted in relation to the apparent anomaly. At least one of the crew members – possibly the captain – from the positioning flight was among those fatally injured during the subsequent accident. While the 'three-chime' alert sounded repeatedly during the ill-fated flight's take-off roll, the inquiry says “it is not clear” why the crew continued to proceed with the flight, particularly given that Fokker documentation requires an abort under such circumstances. Cirium fleets data shows the aircraft was originally delivered to Lufthansa CityLine in 1992 and served with Air Nostrum and Avianca Brazil before being transferred to Skyward from Dutch operator Denim in May 2014. It had been operated in Kenya for just 92h before the crash. Although the accident occurred in 2014, the inquiry was only signed off at the end of November last year and published by the transport ministry in January.",2,645,7.0,0.4088,"crew, runway, inquiry, land, approach, accident, investigator, captain, incident, pilot","['kenyan', 'investigator', 'disclose', 'crew', 'fokker', 'continued', 'takeoff', 'roll', 'despite', 'multiple', 'alert', 'apparently', 'warn', 'serious', 'engine', 'problem', 'crashed', 'become', 'airborne', 'inquiry', 'accident', 'involve', 'skyward', 'international', 'turboprop', 'depart', 'nairobi', 'main', 'international', 'airport', 'found', 'highlevel', 'alert', 'sound', 'roll', 'along', 'runway', 'aural', 'alert', 'commenced', 'early', 'takeoff', 'initiate', 'well', 'decision', 'speed', 'crew', 'act', 'abort', 'takeoff', 'roll', 'flightdata', 'recorder', 'information', 'indicates', 'lefthand', 'pratt', 'whitney', 'canada', 'engine', 'exhibit', 'problem', 'increase', 'torque', 'decline', 'propeller', 'speed', 'compare', 'righthand', 'engine', 'ground', 'roll', 'takeoff', 'seem', 'take', 'runway', 'anticipate', 'attain', 'takeoff', 'speed', 'kenyan', 'accident', 'investigation', 'department', 'state', 'indicate', 'roll', 'lift', 'highelevation', 'airport', 'barely', 'climb', 'inquiry', 'say', 'reach', 'ground', 'continually', 'deviate', 'left', 'extend', 'centreline', 'subsequently', 'collide', 'building', 'northnortheast', 'runway', 'end', 'none', 'occupant', 'pilot', 'engineer', 'loadmaster', 'survive', 'none', 'occupant', 'survive', 'fokker', 'struck', 'building', 'conduct', 'cargo', 'service', 'mogadishu', 'darkness', 'july', 'investigator', 'found', 'discrepancy', 'loadsheet', 'analysis', 'cargo', 'include', 'shipment', 'mild', 'narcotic', 'qat', 'indicate', 'maximum', 'certify', 'gross', 'weight', 'takeoff', 'captain', 'fly', 'log', 'command', 'fokker', 'although', 'inquiry', 'say', 'unable', 'determine', 'whether', 'either', 'pilot', 'demonstrate', 'ability', 'fly', 'turboprop', 'engine', 'inoperable', 'analysis', 'recording', 'previous', 'position', 'alert', 'occur', 'crew', 'spent', 'try', 'diagnose', 'problem', 'despite', 'evidence', 'cockpitvoice', 'recorder', 'monitoring', 'pilot', 'deny', 'knowledge', 'anomaly', 'say', 'inquiry', 'investigator', 'obtain', 'evidence', 'problem', 'record', 'technical', 'log', 'maintenance', 'conduct', 'relation', 'apparent', 'anomaly', 'least', 'crew', 'member', 'possibly', 'captain', 'position', 'among', 'fatally', 'injured', 'subsequent', 'accident', 'alert', 'sound', 'repeatedly', 'illfated', 'takeoff', 'roll', 'inquiry', 'say', 'clear', 'crew', 'continued', 'proceed', 'particularly', 'give', 'fokker', 'documentation', 'require', 'abort', 'circumstance', 'fleet', 'data', 'originally', 'deliver', 'lufthansa', 'cityline', 'serve', 'nostrum', 'avianca', 'brazil', 'transfer', 'skyward', 'dutch', 'operator', 'denim', 'may', 'operate', 'kenya', 'crash', 'although', 'accident', 'occur', 'inquiry', 'sign', 'end', 'november', 'publish', 'transport', 'ministry', 'january']"
"The first of up to four ex-Air France Airbus A380s has been positioned into Ireland West Airport for storage, signalling the start of the airline's superjumbo retirement process. The Engine Alliance GP7200-powered A380 (F-HPJB) touched down at the airport on 20 February where it will be stored at the facilities of Eirtrade Aviation. The airport says that the A380 is the largest-ever aircraft to land at the airport near Knock in County Mayo. It adds that its arrival “is expected to lead to further similar projects in the near term” for Eirtrade's facility. FlightGlobal understands that three more ex-Air France A380s are due to be ferried to the airport. Eirtrade declines to comment on the arrangements and plans for this A380 or any further aircraft. F-HPJB is one of 10 A380s operated by Air France. The airline confirmed last year that theentire fleet would be retired over the next couple of years.

"The coronavirus could cause demand for air travel to fall for the first time since the global financial crisis, with operators in Asia-Pacific hardest hit, according to an initial impact assessment from IATA. Based on a scenario where the coronavirus has a “V-shaped impact” similar to that seen during the SARS outbreak in 2003 – which was characterised by a six-month period with a sharp decline followed by an equally quick recovery – global demand measured in RPKs would be 4.7% down on IATA's previous 2020 outlook. In that outlook, it predicted a 4.1% rise in passenger demand for the year, hence its new assessment suggests a 0.6% net contraction. Demand for air travel has risen every year since 2009, when RPKs fell by 3.5%. Global airline revenues would be some $29.3 billion (€27.1 billion) lower under IATA's latest assessment, which is a 5% drop from the association's previous forecast for 2020. “Airlines are making difficult decisions to cut capacity and in some cases routes,” states IATA director general Alexandre de Juniac. “Lower fuel costs will help offset some of the lost revenue [but] this will be a very tough year for airlines.” Carriers in Asia-Pacific would see a 13% drop in full-year passenger demand, IATA estimates, which would translate to an 8.2% net contraction compared with 2019 levels. The region's carriers would see revenue lower by $27.8 million – the bulk borne by China-registered operators. Some $12.8 billion would be lost in China's domestic market alone. Outside Asia-Pacific, carriers would see a revenue loss of $1.5 billion – but only if the demand fall is limited to markets linked to China. “If [the coronavirus] spreads more widely to Asia-Pacific markets then impacts on airlines from other regions would be larger,” IATA says. The association adds that it is too early to predict what lost revenue would mean for global profitability.",2,648,9.0,0.3998,"industry, crisis, demand, coronavirus, global, iata, market, level, cargo, expect","['coronavirus', 'cause', 'demand', 'travel', 'fall', 'since', 'global', 'financial', 'crisis', 'operator', 'asiapacific', 'hardest', 'hit', 'accord', 'initial', 'impact', 'assessment', 'iata', 'base', 'scenario', 'coronavirus', 'vshaped', 'impact', 'similar', 'see', 'sars', 'outbreak', 'characterise', 'sixmonth', 'period', 'sharp', 'decline', 'follow', 'equally', 'quick', 'recovery', 'global', 'demand', 'measure', 'rpks', 'iata', 'previous', 'outlook', 'outlook', 'predict', 'rise', 'passenger', 'demand', 'hence', 'assessment', 'suggests', 'net', 'contraction', 'demand', 'travel', 'risen', 'every', 'since', 'rpks', 'fell', 'global', 'revenue', 'low', 'iata', 'late', 'assessment', 'drop', 'association', 'previous', 'forecast', 'make', 'difficult', 'decision', 'cut', 'capacity', 'case', 'route', 'state', 'iata', 'director', 'general', 'alexandre', 'de', 'juniac', 'low', 'fuel', 'cost', 'help', 'offset', 'lose', 'revenue', 'tough', 'carrier', 'asiapacific', 'see', 'drop', 'fullyear', 'passenger', 'demand', 'iata', 'estimate', 'translate', 'net', 'contraction', 'compare', 'level', 'region', 'carrier', 'see', 'revenue', 'low', 'bulk', 'borne', 'chinaregistered', 'operator', 'lose', 'domestic', 'market', 'alone', 'outside', 'asiapacific', 'carrier', 'see', 'revenue', 'loss', 'demand', 'fall', 'limited', 'market', 'link', 'coronavirus', 'spread', 'widely', 'asiapacific', 'market', 'impact', 'region', 'large', 'iata', 'say', 'association', 'add', 'early', 'predict', 'lose', 'revenue', 'mean', 'global', 'profitability']"
"Qantas and Jetstar are cutting back flights to Asia and regional destinations for the next three months as demand declines amid the coronavirus outbreak. Flights to China, Hong Kong and Singapore will be affected. The overall reduction of around 16% will last “until at least the end of May”, says Qantas. The Australian airline had been planning to suspend its Sydney-Shanghai route only until the end of March, but will now further defer resumption of the service. On the Melbourne-Singapore route, capacity will be reduced by around 250 seats per flight as the airline deploys Boeing 787s to replace Airbus A380s. Frequencies to Hong Kong will be cut from four times per day to 16 times per week, by means of halving the Sydney flights to daily while scaling the Brisbane service down from daily to four times per week and the Melbourne one from daily to five times per week. Flights between Australia and New Zealand will be reduced 6%, affecting the Sydney and Melbourne routes from Auckland as well as Brisbane-Christchurch. Jetstar will meanwhile cut up to two flights per week from its routes from Cairns to Tokyo Narita and Osaka and from Gold Coast to Narita. Flights from Melbourne and Sydney to Phuket will also be affected. Jetstar Asia, Jetstar Japan and Jetstar Pacific have all suspended flights to China and are cutting flights to other parts of Asia, but Singapore-based Jetstar Asia appears to be the most affected, with a capacity cut of some 15%. The redeployment of an A320 by Jetstar is also on the cards. It is looking to transfer the narrowbody to QantasLink for use in Western Australia, to meet rising demand from the resources sector. However, it is unclear if the aircraft will come from the Australian airline or one of its Asian affiliates. To better match demand, Qantas and Jetstar will also cut its total domestic capacity by 2.3% in the second half of its financial year, which ends 30 June. The cancellations are mainly focused on off-peak flights between major Australian state capital cities, notes Qantas. Its plans to scale back services were disclosed as it announced its first-half results. Underlying profit before tax came in flat at A$771 million ($512 million), as higher revenues helped to offset external headwinds. Group revenue rose 3% to A$9.46 billion, and statutory net profit declined 4% to A$445 million.

"Qantas saw its half-year underlying profit before tax come in flat at A$771 million ($512 million), with higher revenues helping to offset external headwinds. Group revenue for the first half of its 2020 fiscal year, which ended 31 December, rose 3% to A$9.46 billion. A 3% climb in passenger revenue helped the carrier to offset a 6% decline in cargo revenue. The increase in group revenue was notable, despite what the carrier calls “temporary headwinds” from the protests in Hong Kong, weaker freight demand from the US-China trade war, increases in non-fuel costs due to foreign exchange, and a loss of earnings from the sale of its domestic terminals to airport operators. The airline also saw its statutory net profit declining 4% to A$445 million. Qantas's domestic unit saw its underlying earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) declining 2.7% to A$465 million, with revenue coming in at A$3.22 billion. It attributed the results to mixed demand conditions. The airline's international unit delivered a 2.5% lift in EBIT to A$122 million. The 4.1% rise in revenue to A$3.84 billion was partially aided by capacity contraction from its competitors, Qantas growing its Boeing 787 fleet and phasing out 747s, and recording a continued strong performance on the Perth-London route. Having chosen Airbus A350-1000s as the preferred aircraft for ultra-long-haul services, Qantas is working to obtain regulatory approval for such flights. A decision to proceed has been deferred to end-March, pending negotiations with pilots. At low-cost unit Jetstar, EBIT fell 13% to A$220 million as weaker domestic demand, higher fuel costs and foreign exchange, and employee industrial action offset 3.5% revenue growth to A$2.12 billion. Jetstar's Asian also had a challenging six months. While Jetstar Japan remained profitable, Jetstar Pacific has been impacted by “aggressive expansion” by competitors. Jetstar Asia sees continued challenges from rising airport charges. Cash and cash equivalents across the group as of 31 December 2019 amounted to A$1.75 billion, up from A$1.5 billion at the start of 2019. In its outlook, Qantas group chief executive Alan Joyce says the impact of the coronavirus outbreak has led to the suspension of its Sydney-Shanghai service, and that it is seeing demand weakness from other Asian routes. As a result, the company will cut capacity to Asia by 15% “at least until the end of May,” domestic capacity by 2%, and on trans-Tasman services, by 6%. “We have a lot of flexibility in how we respond across the group. We can extend these cuts, cut deeper if we need to, or add capacity back in. Maintaining our strategic position is also key,” says Joyce. It will also look to bring forward the maintenance of 18 aircraft. “When you combine the capacity action we're taking, with the drop in fuel price since coronavirus [outbreak] escalated, we expect to mitigate the total impact on our bottom line to somewhere between A$100 million and A$150 million in the second half,” adds Joyce.",2,650,3.0,0.3869,"passenger, loss, operating, revenue, traffic, month, increase, capacity, decline, result","['qantas', 'saw', 'halfyear', 'underlie', 'profit', 'tax', 'come', 'flat', 'high', 'revenue', 'help', 'offset', 'external', 'headwind', 'revenue', 'half', 'fiscal', 'end', 'december', 'rise', 'climb', 'passenger', 'revenue', 'help', 'carrier', 'offset', 'decline', 'cargo', 'revenue', 'increase', 'revenue', 'notable', 'despite', 'carrier', 'call', 'temporary', 'headwind', 'protest', 'hong', 'kong', 'weaker', 'freight', 'demand', 'uschina', 'trade', 'war', 'increase', 'nonfuel', 'cost', 'due', 'foreign', 'exchange', 'loss', 'earnings', 'sale', 'domestic', 'terminal', 'airport', 'operator', 'saw', 'statutory', 'net', 'profit', 'decline', 'qantas', 'domestic', 'unit', 'saw', 'underlie', 'earnings', 'interest', 'tax', 'ebit', 'decline', 'revenue', 'come', 'attribute', 'result', 'mixed', 'demand', 'condition', 'international', 'unit', 'deliver', 'lift', 'ebit', 'rise', 'revenue', 'partially', 'aid', 'capacity', 'contraction', 'competitor', 'qantas', 'grow', 'fleet', 'phase', 'record', 'continued', 'strong', 'performance', 'perthlondon', 'route', 'chosen', 'prefer', 'ultralonghaul', 'service', 'qantas', 'work', 'obtain', 'regulatory', 'approval', 'decision', 'proceed', 'defer', 'endmarch', 'pending', 'negotiation', 'pilot', 'lowcost', 'unit', 'jetstar', 'ebit', 'fell', 'weaker', 'domestic', 'demand', 'high', 'fuel', 'cost', 'foreign', 'exchange', 'employee', 'industrial', 'action', 'offset', 'revenue', 'growth', 'jetstar', 'asian', 'challenge', 'month', 'jetstar', 'japan', 'remain', 'profitable', 'jetstar', 'pacific', 'impact', 'aggressive', 'expansion', 'competitor', 'jetstar', 'asia', 'see', 'continued', 'challenge', 'rise', 'airport', 'charge', 'cash', 'cash', 'equivalent', 'across', 'december', 'amount', 'start', 'outlook', 'qantas', 'chief', 'executive', 'alan', 'joyce', 'say', 'impact', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'lead', 'suspension', 'sydneyshanghai', 'service', 'see', 'demand', 'weakness', 'asian', 'route', 'result', 'cut', 'capacity', 'asia', 'least', 'end', 'may', 'domestic', 'capacity', 'transtasman', 'service', 'lot', 'flexibility', 'respond', 'across', 'extend', 'cut', 'cut', 'deeper', 'need', 'add', 'capacity', 'back', 'maintain', 'strategic', 'position', 'key', 'say', 'joyce', 'look', 'bring', 'forward', 'maintenance', 'combine', 'capacity', 'action', 'take', 'drop', 'fuel', 'price', 'since', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'escalate', 'expect', 'mitigate', 'total', 'impact', 'bottom', 'line', 'somewhere', 'second', 'half', 'add', 'joyce']"

"Boeing has asked for its tax breaks to be suspended amid an acrimonious and escalating trade war between the USA and the European Union, targeting its respective aircraft manufacturers, that threatens to play long-term havoc on aircraft deliveries on both continents. Lawmakers in the northwestern US state of Washington, where Boeing has a sizable presence, say they will introduce bills to stop giving the Chicago-headquartered plane-maker preferential tax incentives, dating back to 2003, until the USA and the European Union resolve their trade disputes. Boeing says it supports these changes. “Boeing applauds the actions today by Washington State leaders to introduce this legislation,” the company says in a statement on 19 February. “We fully support and have advocated for this action. When enacted, this legislation will resolve the sole finding against the United States in the long-running trade disputes between Europe and the United States over government support for the production of large commercial airplanes. This legislation demonstrates the commitment of Washington–and of the United States–to fair and rules-based trade, and to compliance with the WTO's rulings.” The request is the latest move in an escalating trade dispute between US and European regulators. Last week, the Office of the US Trade Representative raised its tariffs on large European aircraft to 15%, up from the 10% levy implemented last October, in an ongoing disagreement over subsidies. At the centre of the ruling last October were EU subsidies for Boeing's European rival Airbus, which the arbitrator heavily criticised as being “WTO-inconsistent”, and causing adverse effects to the USA. While the USTR was permitted to impose up to 100% tariffs on $7.5 billion of goods – including Airbus jets – the office said at the time it would initially impose 10% levies on new commercial aircraft of more than 30t, and 25% levies on other products such as Irish and Scotch whiskey, German machinery, and cheese. Airbus said earlier this week that it “deeply regrets” the increase, and warns that, as well as escalating the dispute, it creates “more instability” for those US carriers which are “already suffering from a shortage of aircraft”. The aerospace industry is waiting for a second case, currently before the WTO, to be resolved. It targets subsidies that Boeing received through various federal, state and local authorities, particularly in Washington and South Carolina as well as the city of Wichita, Kansas. European trade regulators promised a counterstrike to the USTR measures against European companies once a decision is made. The European Commission already drew up a list of US export targets collectively worth about $20 billion – far greater than the $7.5 billion of countermeasures granted by the WTO to the US government, which had been pursuing remedies for $11 billion of harm caused by EU subsidies. Airbus says it hopes the US Trade Representative will change its position once the World Trade Organization authorises these countermeasures – which are set to affect imports of the 777, 787 and 737 Max – around May-June. Washington State Governor Jay Inslee on Wednesday urged legislators to address the trade issues, “in order to avoid retaliatory tariffs that would damage not just our commercial aircraft industry, but other important Washington exports.” ”The potential negative impact of that is highlighted by the fact that Boeing has said it would like that tax incentive at least suspended until the issue is fully settled with the European Union,” Inslee says. He calls the bills in Congress “just a starting point”. In Wednesday's statement, Boeing addresses “the billions of dollars of illegal 'launch aid' subsidies that have been provided to Airbus, which the WTO has repeatedly found to violate global trade rules, stand unresolved.” “Now is the time for Airbus and the European Union to finally come into compliance by ending illegal launch aid subsidies once and for all and addressing the harm they have caused the United States aerospace industry and its workers,” Boeing adds.",2,652,12.0,0.3991,"travel, government, country, coronavirus, measure, restriction, passenger, state, march, canada","['ask', 'tax', 'break', 'suspend', 'amid', 'acrimonious', 'escalate', 'trade', 'war', 'usa', 'european', 'union', 'target', 'respective', 'manufacturer', 'threatens', 'play', 'longterm', 'havoc', 'delivery', 'continent', 'lawmaker', 'northwestern', 'u', 'state', 'washington', 'sizable', 'presence', 'say', 'introduce', 'bill', 'stop', 'give', 'chicagoheadquartered', 'planemaker', 'preferential', 'tax', 'incentive', 'date', 'back', 'usa', 'european', 'union', 'resolve', 'trade', 'dispute', 'say', 'support', 'change', 'applauds', 'action', 'today', 'washington', 'state', 'leader', 'introduce', 'legislation', 'say', 'statement', 'february', 'fully', 'support', 'advocate', 'action', 'enact', 'legislation', 'resolve', 'sole', 'find', 'united', 'state', 'longrunning', 'trade', 'dispute', 'europe', 'united', 'state', 'government', 'support', 'production', 'large', 'commercial', 'airplane', 'legislation', 'demonstrates', 'commitment', 'united', 'fair', 'rulesbased', 'trade', 'compliance', 'wto', 'request', 'late', 'move', 'escalate', 'trade', 'dispute', 'u', 'european', 'regulator', 'week', 'office', 'u', 'trade', 'representative', 'raise', 'tariff', 'large', 'european', 'levy', 'implement', 'october', 'ongoing', 'disagreement', 'subsidy', 'centre', 'ruling', 'october', 'eu', 'subsidy', 'european', 'rival', 'arbitrator', 'heavily', 'criticise', 'wtoinconsistent', 'cause', 'adverse', 'effect', 'usa', 'ustr', 'permit', 'impose', 'tariff', 'good', 'include', 'jet', 'office', 'say', 'initially', 'impose', 'levy', 'commercial', 'levy', 'product', 'irish', 'scotch', 'whiskey', 'german', 'machinery', 'cheese', 'say', 'earlier', 'week', 'deeply', 'regret', 'increase', 'warns', 'well', 'escalate', 'dispute', 'creates', 'instability', 'u', 'carrier', 'already', 'suffer', 'shortage', 'industry', 'wait', 'second', 'case', 'currently', 'wto', 'resolve', 'target', 'subsidy', 'receive', 'various', 'federal', 'state', 'local', 'authority', 'particularly', 'washington', 'south', 'carolina', 'well', 'city', 'wichita', 'kansa', 'european', 'trade', 'regulator', 'promise', 'counterstrike', 'ustr', 'measure', 'european', 'decision', 'make', 'european', 'commission', 'already', 'drew', 'list', 'u', 'export', 'target', 'collectively', 'worth', 'far', 'great', 'countermeasure', 'grant', 'wto', 'u', 'government', 'pursue', 'remedy', 'harm', 'cause', 'eu', 'subsidy', 'say', 'hope', 'u', 'trade', 'representative', 'change', 'position', 'world', 'trade', 'organization', 'authorises', 'countermeasure', 'set', 'affect', 'import', 'around', 'mayjune', 'washington', 'state', 'governor', 'jay', 'inslee', 'wednesday', 'urge', 'legislator', 'address', 'trade', 'issue', 'order', 'avoid', 'retaliatory', 'tariff', 'damage', 'commercial', 'industry', 'important', 'washington', 'potential', 'negative', 'impact', 'highlight', 'fact', 'say', 'like', 'tax', 'incentive', 'least', 'suspend', 'issue', 'fully', 'settle', 'european', 'union', 'inslee', 'say', 'call', 'bill', 'congress', 'start', 'point', 'wednesday', 'statement', 'address', 'dollar', 'illegal', 'aid', 'subsidy', 'provide', 'wto', 'repeatedly', 'found', 'violate', 'global', 'trade', 'rule', 'stand', 'european', 'union', 'finally', 'come', 'compliance', 'end', 'illegal', 'launch', 'aid', 'subsidy', 'address', 'harm', 'cause', 'united', 'state', 'industry', 'worker', 'add']"
"Vietnamese start-up Bamboo Airways is in talks with Boeing to order as many as 12 777X twinjets. The deal, which would be valued at up to $5 billion at list prices, could be finalised in the second quarter, the airline confirms. “We are now discussing with Boeing,” Bamboo tells Cirium. On the timing of the negotiations, the airline says it has spotted an opportunity in the market given the challenges that the coronavirus has posed to main competitors Vietnam Airlines and VietJet Air. Cirium reported on 12 February that Vietnam Airlines was looking to lease out some of its 787s, A350s and A321s for six-month terms. The Vietnamese flag-carrier said the aircraft were available for lease as a result of a reduction in operational demand attributed to the impact of the coronavirus. Bamboo appears to be taking the opposite strategy by diving into discussions for a dozen high-priced widebodies. Cirium fleets data shows that Bamboo already has three Boeing aircraft in service, all 787-9s, and a further 10 787-9s on firm order. The airline, which has also signed letters of intent covering a further 20 of those aircraft, declined to specify whether it might switch some of its Boeing orders to the 777X. Nor did it give details on how the 777Xs would be financed. Bamboo's entire current fleet is leased. Bamboo's in-service Airbus fleet comprises one A319, nine A320s, three A321s, four A320neos and four A321neos. The airline has two A321neos on firm order and has signed letters of intent covering a further 24. Start-up airlines in Vietnam have a mixed track record. VietJet has expanded rapidly and placed orders for hundreds of aircraft. On the other side of the coin, Vietnamese conglomerate Vingroup this month abandoned plans to establish an airline known asVinpearl Air, citing a desire to focus on its core strengths and potential oversupply in the aviation market. The maiden flight of the 777X on 25 January began at least a year of flight testing involving four aircraft, ahead of first delivery to launch customer Emirates.

"Nepalese investigators have expressed concern over the potential risks of prematurely giving first officers operational experience at difficult airports, in their inquiry into a fatal accident at Lukla. The first officer of an Aircraft Industries Let L-410 had been the flying pilot during a short take-off departure at Lukla last year. As the aircraft began to roll, a power differential between the engines led to an excursion and collision with a helicopter. Nepal's Aircraft Accident Investigation Commission says there is a “major challenge” arising from the desire by first officers to “master” difficult airports before they are authorised or ready for such operations. “It was found that [first officers] have a tendency to request for such opportunities in order to be recognised among their co-workers, so as to be considered the first choice as a [first officer] for all senior captains,” says the inquiry. Instructor pilots “rarely object” to these requests, it adds, especially if favourable conditions, such as good weather, are present. “This sense of early achievement – which actually is dangerous – triggers a sense of satisfaction and feeling of confidence in [first officers],” says the inquiry. It adds that these findings had “relevance” to the 14 April 2019 accident, involving a Summit Air flight, in which the first officer and two ground personnel suffered fatal injuries. Lukla's runway 24 is just 527m in length with an elevation of nearly 2,850m. After the captain performed the taxiing and line-up on the departure runway, he handed control to the first officer, who initiated the take-off roll after just 15s. But the inquiry says this time interval between the line-up and the roll was “not enough” for completing a handover. Investigators had already made a number of recommendations in the aftermath of the accident, among them that captains should not hand control of departures or arrivals to first officers at short take-off and landing airports.",2,654,7.0,0.3866,"crew, runway, inquiry, land, approach, accident, investigator, captain, incident, pilot","['nepalese', 'investigator', 'express', 'concern', 'potential', 'risk', 'prematurely', 'give', 'officer', 'operational', 'experience', 'difficult', 'airport', 'inquiry', 'fatal', 'accident', 'lukla', 'officer', 'industry', 'let', 'fly', 'pilot', 'short', 'takeoff', 'departure', 'lukla', 'begin', 'roll', 'power', 'differential', 'engine', 'lead', 'excursion', 'collision', 'helicopter', 'nepal', 'accident', 'investigation', 'commission', 'say', 'major', 'challenge', 'arise', 'desire', 'officer', 'master', 'difficult', 'airport', 'authorise', 'ready', 'operation', 'found', 'officer', 'tendency', 'request', 'opportunity', 'order', 'recognise', 'among', 'coworkers', 'consider', 'choice', 'officer', 'senior', 'captain', 'say', 'inquiry', 'instructor', 'pilot', 'rarely', 'object', 'request', 'add', 'especially', 'favourable', 'condition', 'good', 'weather', 'present', 'sense', 'early', 'achievement', 'actually', 'dangerous', 'trigger', 'sense', 'satisfaction', 'feel', 'confidence', 'officer', 'say', 'inquiry', 'add', 'finding', 'relevance', 'april', 'accident', 'involve', 'summit', 'officer', 'ground', 'personnel', 'suffer', 'fatal', 'injury', 'lukla', 'runway', 'length', 'elevation', 'nearly', 'captain', 'perform', 'taxi', 'lineup', 'departure', 'runway', 'hand', 'control', 'officer', 'initiate', 'takeoff', 'roll', 'inquiry', 'say', 'interval', 'lineup', 'roll', 'enough', 'complete', 'handover', 'investigator', 'already', 'make', 'number', 'recommendation', 'aftermath', 'accident', 'among', 'captain', 'hand', 'control', 'departure', 'arrival', 'officer', 'short', 'takeoff', 'land', 'airport']"
"Nepalese investigators have attributed a fatal take-off excursion, involving an Aircraft industries Let L-410, to differential thrust following retardation of one throttle lever – but have been unable to determine the reason why the lever slipped back. The Summit Air turboprop had commenced its take-off roll from Lukla;s runway 24, with the first officer flying, but within 3s the aircraft started veering to the right. It left the runway, travelling along grass, before hitting an inner perimeter fence and careering into a helipad, fatally striking two ground personnel and colliding with a helicopter. The L-410's first officer received fatal injuries from the helicopter's rotor. Nepal's Aircraft Accident Investigation Commission found that, about 2s after the aircraft's brakes were released for take-off, there was an “abrupt shifting” of the right-hand throttle lever rearwards. But the inquiry into the accident, on 14 April last year, says the specific reason for the sudden lever shift “couldn't be identified”. The probe was hampered by an absence of cockpit-voice recorder information – which the inquiry believes resulted from incorrect installation of the recorder – as well as a lack of recordings from the control tower. Investigators instead relied on surveillance camera footage, interviews with controllers and the surviving pilot, and flight-data recorder analysis. The inquiry says the captain, as an instructor pilot, handed over controls for take-off to the first officer after line-up. According to the captain, the aircraft had some previous technical issues regarding the “friction lock and power lever”, and that normal practice involved keeping a hand on the throttle during the take-off roll. But the inquiry says the first officer removed his hand from the throttle to hold the control column, and that the captain did not use his own hand to guard the throttle position. Flight-data recordings indicate that, at brake release, the engines' propeller speeds were the same but the right-hand torque was higher than the left. But the right-hand engine speed and torque began to fall moments later, and the aircraft veered towards a steep slope 28m from the threshold. “When [the captain] realised that the aircraft was veering towards [the] right, he took over the aircraft controls from the [first officer],” says the inquiry. While he understood the right-hand throttle was shifting backwards, he advanced it in a bid to correct the L-410's course and applied foot braking. But the right brake proved to be “more effective”, the inquiry says, and this exacerbated the aircraft's tendency to veer to the right. Only three occupants had been on board the L-410. The captain and a flight attendant survived. Investigators point out that there was evidence of “complacency” from the crew, possibly arising from the operation of repetitive short flights on the same sector in a lightly-laden aircraft with fair weather.",2,655,7.0,0.5076,"crew, runway, inquiry, land, approach, accident, investigator, captain, incident, pilot","['nepalese', 'investigator', 'attribute', 'fatal', 'takeoff', 'excursion', 'involve', 'industry', 'let', 'differential', 'thrust', 'follow', 'retardation', 'throttle', 'lever', 'unable', 'determine', 'reason', 'lever', 'slip', 'back', 'summit', 'turboprop', 'commenced', 'takeoff', 'roll', 'lukla', 'runway', 'officer', 'fly', 'within', 'start', 'veer', 'right', 'left', 'runway', 'travel', 'along', 'grass', 'hit', 'inner', 'perimeter', 'fence', 'career', 'helipad', 'fatally', 'strike', 'ground', 'personnel', 'collide', 'helicopter', 'officer', 'receive', 'fatal', 'injury', 'helicopter', 'rotor', 'nepal', 'accident', 'investigation', 'commission', 'found', 'brake', 'release', 'takeoff', 'abrupt', 'shift', 'righthand', 'throttle', 'lever', 'rearward', 'inquiry', 'accident', 'april', 'say', 'specific', 'reason', 'sudden', 'lever', 'shift', 'identify', 'probe', 'hamper', 'absence', 'cockpitvoice', 'recorder', 'information', 'inquiry', 'believe', 'result', 'incorrect', 'installation', 'recorder', 'well', 'lack', 'recording', 'control', 'tower', 'investigator', 'instead', 'rely', 'surveillance', 'camera', 'footage', 'interview', 'controller', 'survive', 'pilot', 'flightdata', 'recorder', 'analysis', 'inquiry', 'say', 'captain', 'instructor', 'pilot', 'hand', 'control', 'takeoff', 'officer', 'lineup', 'accord', 'captain', 'previous', 'technical', 'issue', 'regard', 'friction', 'lock', 'power', 'lever', 'normal', 'practice', 'involve', 'keep', 'hand', 'throttle', 'takeoff', 'roll', 'inquiry', 'say', 'officer', 'remove', 'hand', 'throttle', 'hold', 'control', 'column', 'captain', 'use', 'hand', 'guard', 'throttle', 'position', 'flightdata', 'recording', 'indicate', 'brake', 'release', 'engine', 'propeller', 'speed', 'righthand', 'torque', 'high', 'left', 'righthand', 'engine', 'speed', 'torque', 'begin', 'fall', 'moment', 'later', 'veer', 'towards', 'steep', 'slope', 'threshold', 'captain', 'realise', 'veer', 'towards', 'right', 'take', 'control', 'officer', 'say', 'inquiry', 'understood', 'righthand', 'throttle', 'shift', 'backwards', 'advanced', 'bid', 'correct', 'course', 'apply', 'foot', 'brake', 'right', 'brake', 'prove', 'effective', 'inquiry', 'say', 'exacerbate', 'tendency', 'veer', 'right', 'occupant', 'board', 'captain', 'attendant', 'survive', 'investigator', 'point', 'evidence', 'complacency', 'crew', 'possibly', 'arise', 'operation', 'repetitive', 'short', 'sector', 'lightlyladen', 'fair', 'weather']"
"Boeing has ordered the inspection of all undelivered 737 Maxes, after it found debris in the wing fuel tanks of some of the grounded narrowbodies. The airframer states that it has also recommended that 737 Max customers with aircraft that have been stored for more than a year to inspect fuel tanks for foreign object debris (FOD). The company states it first discovered the FOD while conducting maintenance on undelivered 737 Maxes in storage at its Renton facility. “That finding led to a robust internal investigation and immediate corrective actions in our production system. We are also inspecting all stored 737 Max airplanes at Boeing to ensure there is no FOD,” the airframer says. Boeing did not say if the latest issue would impact the 737 Max's return to service. Aviation site Leeham.net first reported the FOD problem, stating that objects found included tools and rags. While it is unclear how many 737 Maxes were found with the FOD issue, media reports – citing an internal employee memo – indicate “several” aircraft were affected. The FOD issue comes nearly two weeks after Boeing uncovered a new problem with the narrowbody's flight-control computers. Boeing is hoping to get the 737 Max – the subject of a worldwide grounding since March 2019, following two fatal crashes – re-certified by mid-2020.

"Singapore is rolling out a six-month support package for the country's aviation industry, with an aim of safeguarding Changi Airport's air connectivity, reducing business costs, and protecting jobs, amid the coronavirus outbreak that has affected airlines worldwide. The S$112 million ($80.5 million) package will comprise rebates on aircraft landing and parking charges, assistance to ground handling agents, and rental rebates for shops and cargo agents at Changi Airport, says Singapore's finance minister Heng Swee Keat, while announcing the country's budget plan for fiscal 2020, which begins on 1 April. Airlines that had operated scheduled passenger flights between China and Singapore before the coronavirus outbreak will receive landing credits, Heng says, while those that continue to operate flights to China amid the ongoing outbreak will receive rebates on their landing charges. A full rebate on parking charges is being extended to all scheduled passenger flights to Singapore. In addition, a 10% landing charge rebate will also be given to all freighter carriers into Singapore, and applied to all scheduled passenger flights from Southeast Asia to Singapore. Singapore carriers that have obtained a new or renewed certificate of airworthiness for their aircraft from the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) during fiscal year 2019 will receive a 50% rebate on regulatory fees. A planned 1% annual increase in landing, parking and aerobridge charges affecting all operators, which was due to start on 1 April, will also be waived off for a six-month period. The finance ministry adds the package, which is being co-funded by the government, Changi Airport Group, and the CAAS, “will provide immediate relief to affected companies during the [coronavirus] outbreak period”. The support package comes at a time when the coronavirus outbreak has led to a cancellation of more than 80% of scheduled flights between Singapore and China, says Singapore's transport ministry. “There are now fewer than 80 services [to China] per week, compared with over 400 prior to the outbreak. Passenger traffic has dropped,” the ministry was quoted as saying in an 18 February report from Singaporean newspaperToday. This has also led to a decline in traffic from other regions to Singapore, it adds. Hours before the budget plan was announced, Singapore Airlines said it will selectively cut flights to points outside of China for the next three months, including those to parts of Asia-Pacific, Europe, the Middle East, and the United States.",2,657,5.0,0.2451,"carrier, march, international, outbreak, suspend, capacity, schedule, april, united, coronavirus","['singapore', 'roll', 'sixmonth', 'support', 'package', 'country', 'industry', 'aim', 'safeguard', 'changi', 'airport', 'connectivity', 'reduce', 'business', 'cost', 'protect', 'job', 'amid', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'affected', 'worldwide', 'package', 'comprise', 'rebate', 'land', 'parking', 'charge', 'assistance', 'ground', 'handle', 'agent', 'rental', 'rebate', 'shop', 'cargo', 'agent', 'changi', 'airport', 'say', 'singapore', 'finance', 'minister', 'heng', 'swee', 'keat', 'announce', 'country', 'budget', 'plan', 'fiscal', 'begin', 'april', 'operate', 'schedule', 'passenger', 'singapore', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'receive', 'land', 'credit', 'heng', 'say', 'continue', 'operate', 'amid', 'ongoing', 'outbreak', 'receive', 'rebate', 'land', 'charge', 'full', 'rebate', 'parking', 'charge', 'extend', 'schedule', 'passenger', 'singapore', 'addition', 'land', 'charge', 'rebate', 'give', 'freighter', 'carrier', 'singapore', 'apply', 'schedule', 'passenger', 'southeast', 'asia', 'singapore', 'singapore', 'carrier', 'obtain', 'renew', 'certificate', 'airworthiness', 'civil', 'authority', 'singapore', 'caas', 'fiscal', 'receive', 'rebate', 'regulatory', 'fee', 'plan', 'annual', 'increase', 'land', 'parking', 'aerobridge', 'charge', 'affect', 'operator', 'due', 'start', 'april', 'waive', 'sixmonth', 'period', 'finance', 'ministry', 'add', 'package', 'cofunded', 'government', 'changi', 'airport', 'caas', 'provide', 'immediate', 'relief', 'affected', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'period', 'support', 'package', 'come', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'lead', 'cancellation', 'schedule', 'singapore', 'say', 'singapore', 'transport', 'ministry', 'service', 'per', 'week', 'compare', 'prior', 'outbreak', 'passenger', 'traffic', 'drop', 'ministry', 'quote', 'say', 'february', 'report', 'singaporean', 'newspapertoday', 'lead', 'decline', 'traffic', 'region', 'singapore', 'add', 'hour', 'budget', 'plan', 'announce', 'singapore', 'say', 'selectively', 'cut', 'point', 'outside', 'next', 'month', 'include', 'part', 'asiapacific', 'europe', 'middle', 'east', 'united', 'state']"
"A German company is using recycled fuselage parts from the first airline-operated Airbus A380 to create collectable identity tags, following the parting out of the aircraft by Tarmac Aerosave. The ex-Singapore Airlines A380 (MSN003/9V-SKA) is one of two aircraft the airline has retired that are being broken for spares by recycling specialist Tarmac Aerosave in Tarbes, France (above).

"Finnair has begun talks about temporary layoffs with its long-haul pilots following a reduction in its services to China because of the coronavirus outbreak. Negotiations began on 17 February, the airline says. No decisions have yet been made. “We are currently evaluating the impacts flight cancellations due to the novel coronavirus have on our employee resource needs if the exceptional situation prolongs,” says Finnair. “We have now started a co-determination process concerning long-haul pilots to evaluate possible need for temporary layoffs.” The Finnish flag carrier has cancelled its direct flights to China until 28 March and halved the frequency of its Hong Kong service to once per day.

"Russian safety analysis has revealed a disturbing upward trend in the number of hard landings by large transport aircraft which, it concludes, is not simply the result of a rise in traffic. The federal Aviaregister Russia – through a decision by air transport regulator Rosaviatsia – conducted a study into hard landings over the period from January 2009 to October 2019. It states that 176 such landings took place in the timeframe but the annual number remained “relatively stable”, at around 14, until 2015. But during the last three years, 2017-19, the trend has been increasing by five or six incidents per year. “The increase in the number of hard landings, starting in 2017, does not correspond to the increasing flight [activity] during this period,” says the Aviaregister analysis, stating that 28 occurred in the space of 10 months last year. “There is a significant annual increase in the ratio of hard landings to the total number of landings.” It adds that, in the “vast majority” of cases, a hard landing resulted in the aircraft's bouncing and becoming airborne again. The analysis attributes the various incidents to poor piloting technique on the glidepath, including excessive approach speed and “diving” below the glideslope, significant descent rates and incorrect use of engine power. Late and insufficiently prompt alignment are also contributing factors, it adds. But it also claims that airlines have paid “insufficient attention” to previous investigations into hard landings – which, the analysis says, are particularly hazardous events. Nine operators accounted for 70% of the incidents examined, with Utair, Rossiya, Red Wings, Aeroflot and Yakutia listed as the carriers involved in the most occurrences. But the analysis also examines incidents from non-commercial operators including a hard landing and bounce – involving two 2.8g impacts – by a Tupolev Tu-214 of the Russian special flight detachment at Moscow Vnukovo in December 2014. Previous studies have looked into such events involving Soviet-era types in the mid- to late-1980s, as well as examining incidents specifically with Tupolev Tu-154s which were linked to the type's particular characteristics.",2,660,7.0,0.2956,"crew, runway, inquiry, land, approach, accident, investigator, captain, incident, pilot","['russian', 'safety', 'analysis', 'reveal', 'disturb', 'upward', 'trend', 'number', 'hard', 'landing', 'large', 'transport', 'concludes', 'simply', 'result', 'rise', 'traffic', 'federal', 'aviaregister', 'russia', 'decision', 'transport', 'regulator', 'rosaviatsia', 'conduct', 'study', 'hard', 'landing', 'period', 'january', 'october', 'state', 'landing', 'take', 'place', 'timeframe', 'annual', 'number', 'remain', 'relatively', 'stable', 'around', 'trend', 'increase', 'incident', 'per', 'increase', 'number', 'hard', 'landing', 'start', 'correspond', 'increase', 'activity', 'period', 'say', 'aviaregister', 'analysis', 'state', 'occur', 'space', 'month', 'significant', 'annual', 'increase', 'ratio', 'hard', 'landing', 'total', 'number', 'add', 'vast', 'majority', 'case', 'hard', 'land', 'result', 'bounce', 'become', 'airborne', 'analysis', 'attribute', 'various', 'incident', 'poor', 'pilot', 'technique', 'glidepath', 'include', 'excessive', 'approach', 'speed', 'dive', 'glideslope', 'significant', 'descent', 'rate', 'incorrect', 'use', 'engine', 'power', 'late', 'insufficiently', 'prompt', 'alignment', 'contribute', 'factor', 'add', 'claim', 'paid', 'insufficient', 'attention', 'previous', 'investigation', 'hard', 'landing', 'analysis', 'say', 'particularly', 'hazardous', 'event', 'operator', 'account', 'incident', 'examine', 'utair', 'rossiya', 'red', 'wing', 'aeroflot', 'yakutia', 'list', 'carrier', 'involve', 'occurrence', 'analysis', 'examines', 'incident', 'noncommercial', 'operator', 'include', 'hard', 'land', 'bounce', 'involve', 'impact', 'tupolev', 'russian', 'special', 'detachment', 'moscow', 'vnukovo', 'december', 'previous', 'study', 'look', 'event', 'involve', 'sovietera', 'type', 'mid', 'well', 'examine', 'incident', 'specifically', 'tupolev', 'link', 'type', 'particular', 'characteristic']"
"Singapore Airlines (SIA) and SilkAir are selectively cutting several flights outside of China for the next three months due to weak demand caused by the coronavirus outbreak. On 17 February, SIA switched its Singapore-Hong Kong-San Francisco service to a non-stop Singapore-San Francisco service, which will operate until 28 March. It has also cut several other Singapore-Hong Kong flights, and this will last until the end of March. The flight reductions to parts of Asia-Pacific will begin as early as the end of February, while reductions to Europe and the United States flights will begin in March. The month of May will see the most flight cancellations across all affected regions. The cancellations affect SIA and SilkAir services to 17 Asian and Middle Eastern countries, including Japan, Thailand, Indonesia, Australia, India, and the United Arab Emirates. SIA's European flight reductions will cover five countries, while its US reductions will affect New York, Los Angeles and Seattle. Other Asian carriers have also joined in reducing the number of flights around the region. Thai Airways International says it is cutting some flights to South Korea and Singapore for February and March. Air India has cancelled all flights to Hong Kong and Shanghai from mid-February until 28 March. Taiwanese flag carrier China Airlines has cut some flights to Hong Kong, Singapore, Rome and parts of Japan, into at least early March. Compatriot carrier EVA Air is doing the same for the rest of February, while postponing the launches of its Taipei-Milan and Taipei-Phuket services, which were meant to take place in February and April, respectively. The World Health Organisation declared the coronavirus outbreak a “Public Health Emergency of International Concern” on 30 January, and the number of cases has since spiked to more than 71,000 globally. In its 17 February update, the WHO says out of those 71,000 cases, nearly 2,200 were reported in the 24 hour period before the update. The sharply higher number was due to the change in reporting of cases to include clinically diagnosed cases in Hubei province.

"Air Lease is willing to support customers affected by flight cancellations and falling passenger traffic amid fears over the coronavirus. The US lessor says it can help airlines by purchasing aircraft, either for cash or via sale-and-leaseback, or by allowing temporary lease-payment reprieves. “It's only in the last five or six working days that the dialogue has become more intense to discuss their particular circumstances,” said executive chairman Steven Udvar-Hazy, in reference to working with impacted customers, during an earnings call on 14 February. “Whether acquisition of aircraft via sale-and-leasebacks, deferrals of short-term rents, or applying other security deposits we have for some assistance, this is in the very early stages of formulation.” Preliminary estimates by ICAO indicate that the ongoing coronavirus outbreak could wipe out $4-5 billion in airline revenues for the current quarter. This is based on assumptions that overall passenger capacity will decline 39-41%, equivalent to a reduction of 16.4 to 19.6 million passengers. The estimated financial loss, however, does not take into account the reduction in Chinese domestic air traffic, or in traffic to and from Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. “While the current coronavirus has had a huge and large immediate impact, the airline industry takes a sound, long-term view in their overall fleet growth plans,” Air Lease chief executive John Plueger said during the earnings call, in which Los Angeles-based Air Lease disclosed 2019 revenue of nearly $2 billion – an increase of 20%. Comparing the coronavirus with the SARS epidemic in 2003, Plueger suggests that the “severity” of the current outbreak “does seems worse”, noting that traffic growth to be flat or even negative for 2020. Compounding the coronavirus-related unpredictability, it remains uncertain when the Boeing 737 Max will be re-certificated. US carriers have been pushing out their expected re-entry dates into the second half of the year. This means that airlines could be facing their second summer without their Max jets. Air Lease has a total of 15 Max jets in storage expects to take four in 2020, management said during the results briefing. The lessor should have taken delivery of 27 aircraft by the end of 2019. Unwanted jets from Asian customers could be placed with Max customers “struggling to get lift in the face of still-uncertain Max delivery timing”, says the lessor. Udvar-Hazy notes that “a dozen” carriers in Europe “won't hit their summer demand” without extra capacity. Plueger observes: “Max customers still need aircraft, and Airbus can't step in.” Depending on how the situation evolves with the coronavirus, there may be a “shakeout” in what has become increasingly competitive aircraft leasing market, he says. For several years, the leasing industry's incumbents have complained of fierce competition from newcomers who have access to capital but lack knowledge of the craft of aircraft leasing, often applying the label “tourist capital” to such investors. “Anyone with a college degree that has money and speaks some English thinks that they can be in aircraft leasing,” Udvar-Hazy said during a January 2018 panel discussion. If new entrants should start to destabilise as a result of uncertainty in the Asian market, Air Lease, with $22 billion in assets and $6.3 billion in liquidity at 31 December 2019, will seek to pounce on opportunities. “We have some stress in Asia,” Plueger said in response to a question about possible M&A in the near term. “Stress does one thing: it tends to separate the men from the boys. There will be some shakeout there and maybe we can take advantage of that. In times of stress, the people that entered the business with ease, when capital was aplenty, tend to get their mettle tested.”",2,662,2.0,0.2547,"executive, chief, cut, add, situation, staff, crisis, make, coronavirus, employee","['lease', 'willing', 'support', 'customer', 'affected', 'cancellation', 'fall', 'passenger', 'traffic', 'amid', 'fear', 'coronavirus', 'u', 'lessor', 'say', 'help', 'purchasing', 'either', 'cash', 'via', 'saleandleaseback', 'allow', 'temporary', 'leasepayment', 'reprieve', 'work', 'day', 'dialogue', 'become', 'intense', 'discus', 'particular', 'circumstance', 'say', 'executive', 'chairman', 'steven', 'udvarhazy', 'reference', 'work', 'impact', 'customer', 'earnings', 'call', 'february', 'whether', 'acquisition', 'via', 'saleandleasebacks', 'deferral', 'shortterm', 'rent', 'apply', 'security', 'deposit', 'assistance', 'early', 'stage', 'preliminary', 'estimate', 'icao', 'indicate', 'ongoing', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'wipe', 'revenue', 'current', 'quarter', 'base', 'assumption', 'overall', 'passenger', 'capacity', 'decline', 'equivalent', 'reduction', 'passenger', 'estimate', 'financial', 'loss', 'however', 'take', 'account', 'reduction', 'chinese', 'domestic', 'traffic', 'traffic', 'hong', 'kong', 'macau', 'taiwan', 'current', 'coronavirus', 'huge', 'large', 'immediate', 'impact', 'industry', 'take', 'sound', 'longterm', 'view', 'overall', 'fleet', 'growth', 'plan', 'lease', 'chief', 'executive', 'john', 'plueger', 'say', 'earnings', 'call', 'los', 'angelesbased', 'lease', 'disclose', 'revenue', 'nearly', 'increase', 'compare', 'coronavirus', 'sars', 'epidemic', 'plueger', 'suggests', 'severity', 'current', 'outbreak', 'seem', 'bad', 'note', 'traffic', 'growth', 'flat', 'even', 'negative', 'compound', 'coronavirusrelated', 'unpredictability', 'remains', 'uncertain', 'recertificated', 'u', 'carrier', 'push', 'expect', 'reentry', 'date', 'second', 'half', 'mean', 'face', 'second', 'summer', 'without', 'jet', 'lease', 'total', 'jet', 'storage', 'expect', 'take', 'management', 'say', 'result', 'briefing', 'lessor', 'take', 'delivery', 'end', 'unwanted', 'jet', 'asian', 'customer', 'place', 'customer', 'struggle', 'get', 'lift', 'face', 'stilluncertain', 'delivery', 'timing', 'say', 'lessor', 'udvarhazy', 'note', 'dozen', 'carrier', 'europe', 'wo', 'hit', 'summer', 'demand', 'without', 'extra', 'capacity', 'plueger', 'observes', 'customer', 'still', 'need', 'ca', 'step', 'depend', 'situation', 'evolves', 'coronavirus', 'may', 'shakeout', 'become', 'increasingly', 'competitive', 'lease', 'market', 'say', 'several', 'lease', 'industry', 'incumbent', 'complain', 'fierce', 'competition', 'newcomer', 'access', 'capital', 'lack', 'knowledge', 'craft', 'lease', 'often', 'apply', 'label', 'tourist', 'capital', 'investor', 'anyone', 'college', 'degree', 'money', 'speaks', 'english', 'think', 'lease', 'udvarhazy', 'say', 'january', 'panel', 'discussion', 'entrant', 'start', 'destabilise', 'result', 'uncertainty', 'asian', 'market', 'lease', 'asset', 'liquidity', 'december', 'seek', 'pounce', 'opportunity', 'stress', 'asia', 'plueger', 'say', 'response', 'question', 'possible', 'near', 'term', 'stress', 'thing', 'tends', 'separate', 'men', 'boy', 'shakeout', 'maybe', 'take', 'advantage', 'stress', 'people', 'enter', 'business', 'ease', 'capital', 'aplenty', 'tend', 'get', 'mettle', 'test']"
"Air Lease executive chairman Steven Udvar-Hazy has criticised European politicians for failing to address air traffic control inefficiency as part of their efforts to limit aviation's environmental impact. “You have all these politicians making a lot of noise about airlines polluting the earth, but they can't get a united skies air traffic control system together in Europe, which would save hundreds and hundreds of gallons of fuel, which would cut down on pollution and help the environment,” Udvar-Hazy told investors during an earnings call on 14 February. He cites his own experience of flying within Europe. “What really frustrates me and John [Plueger, Air Lease chief executive], because we're pilots, every time we fly to Europe we're put in holding patterns on a 300-mile leg between two cities, but we end up flying 500 miles. “Just in that area alone, there could be significant gains made with very little investment. Instead of ridiculing the airlines, these politicians and leaders should look in their own backyards and see about how incompetent they've been at modernising ATC in Europe.” Airline association IATA said on 12 December that carbon emissions per passenger had declined by more than 50% since 1990, adding: “Much of the improvement has occurred because the industry has achieved an annual fuel-efficiency improvement of 2.3% over the period since 2009, some 0.8 percentage points ahead of target.” Citing that statistic, Air Lease chairman Steven Udvar-Hazy highlights aviation's adoption of cleaner technologies, especially new engines which offer improved fuel efficiency. But he adds: “We do believe that further improvement needs to be made across all engine manufacturers to work out the teething pains associated with this new technology which has impacted dispatch reliability in a negative manner.”",2,663,2.0,0.237,"executive, chief, cut, add, situation, staff, crisis, make, coronavirus, employee","['lease', 'executive', 'chairman', 'steven', 'udvarhazy', 'criticise', 'european', 'politician', 'fail', 'address', 'traffic', 'control', 'inefficiency', 'part', 'effort', 'limit', 'environmental', 'impact', 'politician', 'make', 'lot', 'noise', 'pollute', 'earth', 'ca', 'get', 'united', 'sky', 'traffic', 'control', 'system', 'together', 'europe', 'save', 'hundred', 'hundred', 'gallon', 'fuel', 'cut', 'pollution', 'help', 'environment', 'udvarhazy', 'told', 'investor', 'earnings', 'call', 'february', 'cite', 'experience', 'fly', 'within', 'europe', 'really', 'frustrates', 'john', 'plueger', 'lease', 'chief', 'executive', 'pilot', 'every', 'fly', 'europe', 'put', 'hold', 'pattern', 'leg', 'city', 'end', 'fly', 'mile', 'area', 'alone', 'significant', 'gain', 'make', 'little', 'investment', 'instead', 'ridicule', 'politician', 'leader', 'look', 'backyard', 'see', 'incompetent', 'modernise', 'atc', 'association', 'iata', 'say', 'december', 'carbon', 'emission', 'per', 'passenger', 'decline', 'since', 'add', 'much', 'improvement', 'occur', 'industry', 'achieve', 'annual', 'fuelefficiency', 'improvement', 'period', 'since', 'percentage', 'point', 'ahead', 'cite', 'statistic', 'lease', 'chairman', 'steven', 'udvarhazy', 'highlight', 'adoption', 'cleaner', 'technology', 'especially', 'engine', 'offer', 'improve', 'fuel', 'efficiency', 'add', 'believe', 'far', 'improvement', 'need', 'make', 'across', 'engine', 'manufacturer', 'work', 'teethe', 'pain', 'associate', 'technology', 'impact', 'dispatch', 'reliability', 'negative', 'manner']"
"Argentinean investigators have opened a probe after an Embraer 190 apparently lost its left-hand nose-wheel in Rosario. The Austral Lineas Aereas twinjet (LV-CHQ) had arrived at Rosario following a service from Buenos Aires on 16 February. Argentinean accident investigation authority JIAAC says the incident occurred at about 23:10 local time and none of those on board was injured. But the incident is the second nose-wheel loss to occur to an Austral E190 in about two years. JIAAC completed last year an investigation into the previous incident, to LV-CID in January 2018, which occurred before take-off at Mar del Plata when the left-hand nose-wheel detached during taxiing. Examination of the failure turned up evidence of corrosive pitting and that this had led to an undetected fissure. JIAAC had stated in its conclusions that it believed the incident was “isolated”. It has yet to disclose any findings regarding the circumstances of the latest incident, or indicate whether a similar mechanism led to the failure. Cirium fleets data shows that the two aircraft first flew six weeks apart – LV-CHQ in November 2010, LV-CID in December 2010 – before they were respectively delivered to Austral in December 2010 and February 2011.",2,664,7.0,0.2667,"crew, runway, inquiry, land, approach, accident, investigator, captain, incident, pilot","['argentinean', 'investigator', 'open', 'probe', 'embraer', 'apparently', 'lose', 'lefthand', 'nosewheel', 'rosario', 'austral', 'lineas', 'aereas', 'twinjet', 'lvchq', 'arrive', 'rosario', 'follow', 'service', 'buenos', 'aire', 'february', 'argentinean', 'accident', 'investigation', 'authority', 'jiaac', 'say', 'incident', 'occur', 'local', 'none', 'board', 'injured', 'incident', 'second', 'nosewheel', 'loss', 'occur', 'austral', 'jiaac', 'complete', 'investigation', 'previous', 'incident', 'lvcid', 'january', 'occur', 'takeoff', 'mar', 'del', 'plata', 'lefthand', 'nosewheel', 'detach', 'taxi', 'examination', 'failure', 'turn', 'evidence', 'corrosive', 'pit', 'lead', 'undetected', 'fissure', 'jiaac', 'state', 'conclusion', 'believe', 'incident', 'isolated', 'yet', 'disclose', 'finding', 'regard', 'circumstance', 'late', 'incident', 'indicate', 'whether', 'similar', 'mechanism', 'lead', 'failure', 'fleet', 'data', 'flew', 'week', 'apart', 'lvchq', 'november', 'lvcid', 'december', 'respectively', 'deliver', 'austral', 'december', 'february']"
"Embattled Hong Kong-carrier Cathay Pacific has warned its first half results for 2020 will be “significantly down” compared to the same period last year, as the outbreak of the coronavirus compounds an already challenging market. In releasing its traffic figures for January, the Oneworld carrier also announced further capacity cuts across its network – for February and March. The carrier, along with its Cathay Dragon unit, will slash passenger capacity by 40%. This, the carrier notes, is an even deeper cut than the 30% capacity reduction it announced earlier this month. Cathay and Cathay Dragon combined carried just over 3 million passengers in January, a 3.8% decrease year-on-year. The carrier cut capacity as measured in ASKs by 0.3%, while traffic in terms of RPK fell 1.8%. As a result, passenger load factor for January fell by 1.3 percentage points to 84.7%. Cathay Pacific Group chief customer and commercial officer Ronald Lam notes that while inbound traffic into the territory fell again, outbound traffic grew marginally. Cathay inbound traffic fell 40% year-on-year, slightly better than the 46% seen in November and December. Traffic figures at the carrier had already been impacted by political unrest in Hong Kong, where pro-democracy protests have been raging since June. Outbound traffic rose 1% in January. Lam says this was due to the earlier falling of the Chinese New Year holiday this year, which began at the end of January. Cathay says yield and load factors for its long haul routes were improving at the start of January, only for the coronavirus outbreak to hit its performance. “Our performance deteriorated rapidly in the last week of January as the novel coronavirus situation became more severe, and it continues to weaken significantly. We saw significant cancellation of bookings within a short period of time,” says Lam. While Hong Kong is the not at the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak, travel restrictions imposed by some countries have also included Hong Kong. This, says Lam, led to a rise in cancelled bookings. Since last year, Cathay has flagged a financially challenging first-half of 2020 amid the backdrop of local unrest. “The first half of 2020 was already expected to be extremely challenging financially. As a result of this additional significant drop in demand for flights and consequential capacity reduction caused by the novel coronavirus outbreak, the financial results for the first half of 2020 will be significantly down on the same period last year,” Lam says. In early February, the carrier said it had asked its staff to take unpaid leave in a bid to stave off the financial fallout from the virus outbreak.",2,665,3.0,0.4084,"passenger, loss, operating, revenue, traffic, month, increase, capacity, decline, result","['embattle', 'hong', 'kongcarrier', 'cathay', 'pacific', 'warn', 'half', 'result', 'significantly', 'compare', 'period', 'outbreak', 'coronavirus', 'compound', 'already', 'challenge', 'market', 'release', 'traffic', 'figure', 'january', 'oneworld', 'carrier', 'announce', 'far', 'capacity', 'cut', 'across', 'network', 'february', 'march', 'carrier', 'along', 'cathay', 'dragon', 'unit', 'slash', 'passenger', 'capacity', 'carrier', 'note', 'even', 'deeper', 'cut', 'capacity', 'reduction', 'announce', 'earlier', 'month', 'cathay', 'cathay', 'dragon', 'combine', 'carry', 'passenger', 'january', 'decrease', 'yearonyear', 'carrier', 'cut', 'capacity', 'measure', 'asks', 'traffic', 'term', 'rpk', 'fell', 'result', 'passenger', 'load', 'factor', 'january', 'fell', 'percentage', 'point', 'cathay', 'pacific', 'chief', 'customer', 'commercial', 'officer', 'ronald', 'lam', 'note', 'inbound', 'traffic', 'territory', 'fell', 'outbound', 'traffic', 'grow', 'marginally', 'cathay', 'inbound', 'traffic', 'fell', 'yearonyear', 'slightly', 'well', 'see', 'november', 'december', 'traffic', 'figure', 'carrier', 'already', 'impact', 'political', 'unrest', 'hong', 'kong', 'prodemocracy', 'protest', 'rag', 'since', 'june', 'outbound', 'traffic', 'rise', 'january', 'lam', 'say', 'due', 'earlier', 'fall', 'chinese', 'holiday', 'begin', 'end', 'january', 'cathay', 'say', 'yield', 'load', 'factor', 'long', 'haul', 'route', 'improve', 'start', 'january', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'hit', 'performance', 'performance', 'deteriorate', 'rapidly', 'week', 'january', 'novel', 'coronavirus', 'situation', 'become', 'severe', 'continue', 'weaken', 'significantly', 'saw', 'significant', 'cancellation', 'booking', 'within', 'short', 'period', 'say', 'lam', 'hong', 'kong', 'epicentre', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'travel', 'restriction', 'impose', 'country', 'include', 'hong', 'kong', 'say', 'lam', 'lead', 'rise', 'cancel', 'booking', 'since', 'cathay', 'flag', 'financially', 'challenge', 'firsthalf', 'amid', 'backdrop', 'local', 'unrest', 'half', 'already', 'expect', 'extremely', 'challenge', 'financially', 'result', 'additional', 'significant', 'drop', 'demand', 'consequential', 'capacity', 'reduction', 'cause', 'novel', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'financial', 'result', 'half', 'significantly', 'period', 'lam', 'say', 'early', 'february', 'carrier', 'say', 'ask', 'staff', 'take', 'unpaid', 'leave', 'bid', 'stave', 'financial', 'fallout', 'virus', 'outbreak']"
"Indian investigators believe inadequate flare by the first officer of an IndiGo Airlines Airbus A320 led to a hard landing by the twinjet at Raipur. The aircraft (VT-IGK), arriving from Delhi, had been conducting an ILS approach to runway 24 with the first officer – who was undergoing supervised line training – as the flying pilot. India's DGCA states that the twinjet was properly configured and carrying out a normal approach, with only minor deviations, until it reached a height of 50ft. “The [captain] noticed weak flare and advised the first officer to correct it,” says the inquiry into the 14 December 2016 incident. Flight-data recorder information shows that pitch stayed steady at 2.1° from 100ft down to just 10ft, and at 8ft the captain intervened to reinforce the flare, bringing the pitch up to 4.9° at the point of touchdown. The aircraft was descending at 585ft/min and it contacted the runway with a 2.5g impact, bouncing to a height of 9ft over the next 2.1s. Its descended again, with a higher rate of 668ft/min, and landed harder at 3.16g, above the manufacturer's structural limit of 2.6g. None of the 167 passengers and seven crew members was injured. While no damage to the A320 was observed, it was ferried to Delhi for further inspection and precautionary replacement of the landing-gear. The jet was released back to service 16 days after the incident. The inquiry says the first officer had logged 69h on A320s – out of a total time of about 350h – and she informed investigators that she had been “totally focused on maintaining the centreline” and did not provide sufficient flare on the approach.

"Cirrus grounded its global fleet of more than 170 SF50 Vision Jets on 7 February, and issued a mandatory service bulletin (SB) to all owners of the single-engined aircraft, after identifying faulty audio amplifier circuit cards as the cause of a 27 December cabin fire. The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued an emergency airworthiness directive on 14 February instructing SF50 operators to comply with the service bulletin, but Cirrus says 97% of owners had already done so within a week, and their aircraft have now returned to service. The remaining 3% of SF50 operators “have yet to comply with the SB”, it notes. The cabin fire occurred while a SF50 was on the ground in Santa Monica, California. Cirrus says the “probable root cause” was a malfunction of the audio interface circuit card which can result in excessive heat generation. “There are 12 of these cards on the SF50, all of which are located in the cabin,” says Cirrus in a 7 February letter to its customers. These cards provide the audio and microphone functions to the 3.5mm jacks located next to the passenger USB ports in the cabin. Cirrus stresses that these are not the audio/mic jacks for the aviation headset. “This issue will be resolved by removing the 12 circuit cards in the aircraft,” says Cirrus. “It affects every SF50 in operation and needs to be complied with immediately. This means no flights are permitted - other than special flight ferry permit flights until the 12 circuit cards have been removed from the aircraft.” In its directive, the FAA says the issue, if not addressed, ”could lead to uncontained cabin fire, resulting in possible occupant injury or loss of airplane control”. Around 8h of work is required to remove interior panels, extract the cards, replace the interior panels and return the aircraft to service, Cirrus says. The work can be performed at Cirrus's factory and authorised service centres, and as well as “in the field” using Cirrus mobile service teams. “Operating the aircraft without these 12 circuit cards causes minimal loss of functionality – just the mic/audio capabilities of the smaller 3.5mm jacks throughout the cabin which are rarely used,” says Cirrus. Early in the investigation, the Duluth headquartered manufacturer says it issued a service advisory and a service bulletin which called for disabling the in-flight entertainment system, USB ports, convenience lights and power outlets in cabin. “We did this out of an abundance of caution as we worked through the early stages and initial feedback of the investigation”, says Cirrus. These “convenience systems” can be enabled as part of the mandatory SB, says Cirrus.

"Malaysia Airlines has signed a codesharing agreement with LATAM Airlines, extending its reach into South America starting this month. The Malaysian carrier will codeshare on LATAM-operated flights from points in Australia and New Zealand to Santiago, and LATAM will codeshare on Malaysia-operated flights to Kuala Lumpur.  Cirium schedules data shows that this is the first codeshare between Malaysia and LATAM, which are members of the Oneworld alliance. LATAM though is leaving Oneworld in May, after striking a joint venture deal with SkyTeam member Delta Air Lines to replace its regulator-blocked planned tie-up with Oneworld partners American Airlines and British Airways. Meanwhile, Malaysia Airlines began a Kuala Lumpur-Kertajati service on 13 February with Boeing 737-800s, operated twice weekly. The route marks the first international service to be operated out of Kertajati.

"China's three largest airlines began the year with falling traffic, amid the growing spread of the novel coronavirus outbreak in the country and around the world. In traffic figures released for January, Air China, China Eastern Airlines and China Southern Airlines all carried fewer passengers, and recorded drops in passenger load factors. Regional routes on each of the carriers bore the brunt of falling traffic figures, many notching double-digit decreases for the period. Air China carried 9.2 million passengers for the month, a 4.1% drop year-on-year. Its regional network saw passenger numbers tumble 18.7% – the largest change across the carrier's network. The only bright spot was its international network, which saw a marginal 0.9% rise in passengers carried. ASKs rose 1.2% year-on-year, which led to a drop in passenger load factor. The Star Alliance carrier saw a 3.3 percentage point decrease in passenger load factor. Meanwhile, China Eastern carried 10.1 million passengers for January, a 5.4% drop compared to the same period last year. Domestic and regional routes saw falls in passengers carried, while international routes notched a 6% increase year-on-year. Overall passenger load factor fell 5.4 percentage points to 75.4%, due in part to rising ASKs. The SkyTeam carrier saw the sharpest decline in its regional network, with a 12.8% drop to 69.1%. China Southern carried 11.4 million passengers for the period, 4.6% lower than the same month last year. Regional routes saw a dramatic 36% fall year-on-year in passengers carried. ASKs for the carrier's overall network rose a marginal 2.3%, offset by drops in its domestic and regional network. Overall passenger load factor for the month slid 3.7% year-on-year to 76.7%. The three carriers did not offer much by way of analysis about how the outbreak will affect the business. China Eastern states that the airline has “suspended or adjusted the operation of certain routes and flights” in light of the outbreak, which has led to a “change of market demand and operating environment”. China Southern echoed similar sentiments, adding that it would work to recover frequency “as appropriate”. Air China did not discuss the matter. The latest traffic figures comes as ICAO's preliminary estimates indicate a $4-5 billion revenue loss from the global airline industry because of the virus outbreak. Some airlines, including the Lufthansa group and American Airlines, have cancelled all flights into the Mainland China following the outbreak, while scores of other carriers have reduced services. Chinese carriers too have cut flights domestically and internationally, as the outbreak continues to spread, and in response to travel restrictions imposed around the world.",2,669,3.0,0.5384,"passenger, loss, operating, revenue, traffic, month, increase, capacity, decline, result","['large', 'begin', 'fall', 'traffic', 'amid', 'grow', 'spread', 'novel', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'country', 'around', 'world', 'traffic', 'figure', 'release', 'january', 'eastern', 'southern', 'carry', 'passenger', 'record', 'drop', 'passenger', 'load', 'factor', 'regional', 'route', 'carrier', 'bore', 'brunt', 'fall', 'traffic', 'figure', 'many', 'notch', 'doubledigit', 'decrease', 'period', 'carry', 'passenger', 'month', 'drop', 'yearonyear', 'regional', 'network', 'saw', 'passenger', 'number', 'tumble', 'large', 'change', 'across', 'carrier', 'network', 'bright', 'spot', 'international', 'network', 'saw', 'marginal', 'rise', 'passenger', 'carry', 'asks', 'rise', 'yearonyear', 'lead', 'drop', 'passenger', 'load', 'factor', 'star', 'alliance', 'carrier', 'saw', 'percentage', 'point', 'decrease', 'passenger', 'load', 'factor', 'meanwhile', 'eastern', 'carry', 'passenger', 'january', 'drop', 'compare', 'period', 'domestic', 'regional', 'route', 'saw', 'fall', 'passenger', 'carry', 'international', 'route', 'notch', 'increase', 'yearonyear', 'overall', 'passenger', 'load', 'factor', 'fell', 'percentage', 'point', 'due', 'part', 'rise', 'asks', 'skyteam', 'carrier', 'saw', 'sharpest', 'decline', 'regional', 'network', 'drop', 'southern', 'carry', 'passenger', 'period', 'low', 'month', 'regional', 'route', 'saw', 'dramatic', 'fall', 'yearonyear', 'passenger', 'carry', 'asks', 'carrier', 'overall', 'network', 'rise', 'marginal', 'offset', 'drop', 'domestic', 'regional', 'network', 'overall', 'passenger', 'load', 'factor', 'month', 'slid', 'yearonyear', 'carrier', 'offer', 'much', 'way', 'analysis', 'outbreak', 'affect', 'business', 'eastern', 'state', 'suspend', 'adjust', 'operation', 'certain', 'route', 'light', 'outbreak', 'lead', 'change', 'market', 'demand', 'operating', 'environment', 'southern', 'echoed', 'similar', 'sentiment', 'add', 'work', 'recover', 'frequency', 'appropriate', 'discus', 'matter', 'late', 'traffic', 'figure', 'come', 'icao', 'preliminary', 'estimate', 'indicate', 'revenue', 'loss', 'global', 'industry', 'virus', 'outbreak', 'include', 'lufthansa', 'american', 'cancel', 'mainland', 'follow', 'outbreak', 'score', 'carrier', 'reduce', 'service', 'chinese', 'carrier', 'cut', 'domestically', 'internationally', 'outbreak', 'continue', 'spread', 'response', 'travel', 'restriction', 'impose', 'around', 'world']"
"The United States is reportedly considering blocking the sale of engines for Comac's C919 narrowbody programme. Citing unnamed sources close to the matter, Reuters and theWall Street Journalreported over the weekend that potential restrictions covering CFM International Leap-1C engines for the programme might be accompanied by limits on the export of other systems, such as Honeywell flight-control systems. The US government will reportedly discuss the matter – as part of a larger discussion on how to restrict US technology exports to China – this week and later in the month, before arriving at a decision. The restriction would apparently take the form of a refusal to reapprove GE Aviation's export licences for the engine. The enginemaker has obtained export licences from the US government for the Leap-1C engines since 2014, having most recently received one in March 2019. CFM is a joint venture between GE and France's Safran. Apart from powering the C919, other variants of the Leap are also an option for the Airbus A320neo, and the exclusive powerplant for the grounded Boeing 737 Max. Responding to FlightGlobal's request for comment, GE says: ”GE has provided products and services in the global marketplace for decades. We aggressively protect and defend our intellectual property and work closely with the US government to fulfill our responsibilities and shared security and economic interests.” Honeywell declined to comment, while Comac did not respond. Comac has six C919 test aircraft flying, all fitted with the Leap-1C. It has more than 300 Leap-powered aircraft in its order book. Comac is looking at a 2021-2022 date for the C919's service entry. Apart from CFM engines, the C919 will also be fitted with Chinese-made powerplants. Progress on the developmental CJ-1000AX high-bypass turbofan, manufactured by AECC Commercial Aircraft Engine, is still unclear. It was reported in 2018 that the CJ-1000AX demonstrator engine achieved power-on. Chinese media reports indicate the CJ-1000AX is looking to enter service in 2021. Any restriction of Leap engines to China could deal a blow to the C919, pushing its timeline further to the right. It would also mark the latest event in a simmering back-and-forth between the Chinese and US governments over trade and technology transfer.

"Airbus has criticised the US government's decision to increase tariffs on imported aircraft, claiming it simply exacerbates problems for the country's own airlines. The US Trade Representative decision – which hikes tariffs from the previous 10% to a level of 15% – is a consequence of the long-running transatlantic subsidies dispute with the European Union. Airbus says it “deeply regrets” the measure. It warns that, as well as escalating the trade dispute, it creates “more instability” for those US carriers which are “already suffering from a shortage of aircraft”. Thirty percent of all Boeing 737 Max jets already delivered – and grounded since March last year – have gone to US customers, including lessors. American Airlines, United Airlines and Southwest Airlines are among operators which are unable to use their Max fleets. Airbus argues that US carriers have put forward “many” submissions pointing out that tariffs will effectively punish US passengers when costs are passed down. The airframer adds that the escalation “complicates” any future negotiation effort to resolve the dispute. “This is regrettable,” it says, adding that it will continue talks with US customers to “mitigate” the impact of tariffs as far as possible. Airbus has long argued that a negotiated settlement is the only sensible outcome, a point which chief executive Guillaume Faury reiterated during a briefing in Toulouse on 13 February. Faury also pointed out that the European Union is likely to impose similar countermeasures later this year in its own case against US government support to Boeing. Airbus says it hopes the US Trade Representative will change its position once the World Trade Organization authorises these countermeasures – which are set to affect imports of the 777, 787 and 737 Max – around May-June.",2,671,12.0,0.2384,"travel, government, country, coronavirus, measure, restriction, passenger, state, march, canada","['criticise', 'u', 'government', 'decision', 'increase', 'tariff', 'import', 'claim', 'simply', 'exacerbates', 'problem', 'country', 'u', 'trade', 'representative', 'decision', 'hike', 'tariff', 'previous', 'level', 'consequence', 'longrunning', 'transatlantic', 'subsidy', 'dispute', 'european', 'union', 'say', 'deeply', 'regret', 'measure', 'warns', 'well', 'escalate', 'trade', 'dispute', 'creates', 'instability', 'u', 'carrier', 'already', 'suffer', 'shortage', 'thirty', 'percent', 'jet', 'already', 'deliver', 'ground', 'since', 'march', 'go', 'u', 'customer', 'include', 'lessor', 'american', 'united', 'southwest', 'among', 'operator', 'unable', 'use', 'fleet', 'argues', 'u', 'carrier', 'put', 'forward', 'many', 'submission', 'point', 'tariff', 'effectively', 'punish', 'u', 'passenger', 'cost', 'pass', 'airframer', 'add', 'escalation', 'complicates', 'future', 'negotiation', 'effort', 'resolve', 'dispute', 'regrettable', 'say', 'add', 'continue', 'talk', 'u', 'customer', 'mitigate', 'impact', 'tariff', 'far', 'possible', 'long', 'argue', 'negotiate', 'settlement', 'sensible', 'outcome', 'point', 'chief', 'executive', 'guillaume', 'faury', 'reiterate', 'briefing', 'toulouse', 'february', 'faury', 'point', 'european', 'union', 'likely', 'impose', 'similar', 'countermeasure', 'later', 'case', 'u', 'government', 'support', 'say', 'hope', 'u', 'trade', 'representative', 'change', 'position', 'world', 'trade', 'organization', 'authorises', 'countermeasure', 'set', 'affect', 'import', 'around', 'mayjune']"
"The Office of the US Trade Representative has raised its tariffs on large European aircraft to 15%, up from the 10% levy implemented last October, in an ongoing dispute over subsidies. “The United States is increasing the additional duty rate imposed on aircraft imported from the EU to 15% from 10%, effective March 18, 2020, and making certain other minor modifications,” the USTR says in a statement published on 14 February. At the centre of the ruling last October were EU subsidies for Airbus, which the arbitrator heavily criticised as being “WTO-inconsistent”, and causing adverse effects to the USA. While the USTR was permitted to impose up to 100% tariffs on $7.5 billion of goods – including Airbus jets – the office said at the time it would initially impose 10% levies on new commercial aircraft of more than 30t, and 25% levies on other products such as Irish and Scotch whisky, German machinery, and cheese. The increase to 15% is in response to a World Trade Organization report related to a longstanding subsidy dispute involving Airbus. That report, released 2 December, concluded that changes made to A350 and A380 development loans were insufficient to bring European governments into compliance with WTO recommendations. On 12 December the US Trade Representative announced a review of the tariffs and requested public comments. It says it received more than 26,000 responses. “Based on this review, the US Trade Representative has determined to revise the action being taken by increasing the rate of additional duties on certain large civil aircraft, and by modifying the list of other products of certain current and former EU member states subject to additional 25% duties,” the USTR writes in its ruling. With this new ruling, the tariffs on non-aircraft products remain at 25%. Airbus has a large presence in the USA, including an A320 and A220 assembly site in Mobile, Alabama. It said in October that 40% of its aircraft-related procurement comes from US companies. The ruling, which applies to aircraft built in Europe, means that parts shipped over the Mobile to be assembled appeared to be exempt from the additional tariffs. While US carriers with large Airbus fleets such as Delta Air Lines and JetBlue will receive some of their deliveries from Mobile, the majority of Airbus aircraft are still manufactured at the company's European hubs of Hamburg and Toulouse. It is unclear as to what the effect of these increased tariffs will have on the affected airlines, as well as the traveling public who may ultimately pay higher fares as a result. Airbus has been working to mitigate the impact of tariffs since they were initially imposed. Chief executive Guillaume Faury stated at a briefing on 13 February that the tariffs have had a ”direct imipact” on its US commercial aircraft customers which “we are working to manage”. “Later this year the WTO is expected to authorise the EU to impose tariffs on US products. We remian hopeful that the US and EU will find a negotiated settlement to avoid further damage,” he says. The US government will be allowed to impose the tariffs until the EU brings its practices into compliance with WTO standards. In arriving at the $7.5 billion price tag, the arbitrator took into account the value of the lost sales of large Boeing aircraft as a result of the subsidies.",2,672,12.0,0.3782,"travel, government, country, coronavirus, measure, restriction, passenger, state, march, canada","['office', 'u', 'trade', 'representative', 'raise', 'tariff', 'large', 'european', 'levy', 'implement', 'october', 'ongoing', 'dispute', 'subsidy', 'united', 'state', 'increase', 'additional', 'duty', 'rate', 'impose', 'import', 'eu', 'effective', 'march', 'make', 'certain', 'minor', 'modification', 'ustr', 'say', 'statement', 'publish', 'february', 'centre', 'ruling', 'october', 'eu', 'subsidy', 'arbitrator', 'heavily', 'criticise', 'wtoinconsistent', 'cause', 'adverse', 'effect', 'usa', 'ustr', 'permit', 'impose', 'tariff', 'good', 'include', 'jet', 'office', 'say', 'initially', 'impose', 'levy', 'commercial', 'levy', 'product', 'irish', 'scotch', 'whisky', 'german', 'machinery', 'cheese', 'increase', 'response', 'world', 'trade', 'organization', 'report', 'related', 'longstanding', 'subsidy', 'dispute', 'involve', 'report', 'release', 'december', 'conclude', 'change', 'make', 'development', 'loan', 'insufficient', 'bring', 'european', 'government', 'compliance', 'wto', 'recommendation', 'december', 'u', 'trade', 'representative', 'announce', 'review', 'tariff', 'request', 'public', 'comment', 'say', 'receive', 'response', 'base', 'review', 'u', 'trade', 'representative', 'determine', 'revise', 'action', 'take', 'increase', 'rate', 'additional', 'duty', 'certain', 'large', 'civil', 'modify', 'list', 'product', 'certain', 'current', 'former', 'eu', 'member', 'state', 'subject', 'additional', 'duty', 'ustr', 'writes', 'ruling', 'ruling', 'tariff', 'nonaircraft', 'product', 'remain', 'large', 'presence', 'usa', 'include', 'assembly', 'site', 'mobile', 'alabama', 'say', 'october', 'aircraftrelated', 'procurement', 'come', 'u', 'ruling', 'applies', 'built', 'europe', 'mean', 'part', 'ship', 'mobile', 'assemble', 'appear', 'exempt', 'additional', 'tariff', 'u', 'carrier', 'large', 'fleet', 'delta', 'line', 'jetblue', 'receive', 'delivery', 'mobile', 'majority', 'still', 'manufacture', 'european', 'hub', 'hamburg', 'toulouse', 'unclear', 'effect', 'increase', 'tariff', 'affected', 'well', 'travel', 'public', 'may', 'ultimately', 'pay', 'high', 'fare', 'result', 'work', 'mitigate', 'impact', 'tariff', 'since', 'initially', 'impose', 'chief', 'executive', 'guillaume', 'faury', 'state', 'briefing', 'february', 'tariff', 'direct', 'imipact', 'u', 'commercial', 'customer', 'work', 'manage', 'later', 'wto', 'expect', 'authorise', 'eu', 'impose', 'tariff', 'u', 'product', 'remian', 'hopeful', 'u', 'eu', 'find', 'negotiate', 'settlement', 'avoid', 'far', 'damage', 'say', 'u', 'government', 'allow', 'impose', 'tariff', 'eu', 'brings', 'practice', 'compliance', 'wto', 'standard', 'arrive', 'price', 'tag', 'arbitrator', 'take', 'account', 'value', 'lose', 'sale', 'large', 'result', 'subsidy']"
"American Airlines says it expects it will not have the Boeing 737 Max in its schedule until mid-August, the last major US airline to plan through the lucrative summer peak travel season without the new generation aircraft, which has been grounded since March 2019. Earlier in the day United Airlines cancelled all Max flights through 4 September and on Thursday Southwest Airlines said it will not be scheduling the Max until 10 August. Delta Air Lines, Spirit Airlines and JetBlue Airways do not have any Max in their fleets or on order. “American Airlines remains in continuous contact with the Federal Aviation Administration, Department of Transportation and Boeing,” the airline writes in a note on its website on 14 February. “Based on the latest guidance, the airline anticipates that the resumption of scheduled commercial service on American's fleet of Boeing 737 MAX aircraft will occur Aug. 18, 2020.” The Fort-Worth-based carrier has 24 Max aircraft in storage and another 76 on order from Boeing. The type's grounding is in its 11thmonth following two deadly crashes, and there is no indication when it will be recertificated and return to revenue service. The Federal Aviation Administration and Boeing continue to scrutinize the Max but so far no certification flight test has been scheduled. “American expects to gradually phase in the MAX for commercial service and will increase flying on the aircraft throughout the month of August and into September,” the airline adds. “Since American will gradually phase the MAX into our operation over the course of a month, additional refinements to our schedule may occur.” American's executives told analysts on its full-year earnings call on 23 January that the airline was forced to cancel about 10,000 flights alone during the final quarter of 2019 due to the grounding. The airline said it expects to book a loss in 2020 similar to the $540 full-year loss incurred in 2019.",2,673,5.0,0.1816,"carrier, march, international, outbreak, suspend, capacity, schedule, april, united, coronavirus","['american', 'say', 'expect', 'schedule', 'midaugust', 'major', 'u', 'plan', 'lucrative', 'summer', 'peak', 'travel', 'season', 'without', 'generation', 'ground', 'since', 'march', 'earlier', 'day', 'united', 'cancel', 'september', 'thursday', 'southwest', 'say', 'schedule', 'august', 'delta', 'line', 'spirit', 'jetblue', 'airway', 'fleet', 'order', 'american', 'remains', 'continuous', 'contact', 'federal', 'administration', 'department', 'transportation', 'writes', 'note', 'website', 'february', 'base', 'late', 'guidance', 'anticipates', 'resumption', 'schedule', 'commercial', 'service', 'american', 'fleet', 'occur', 'fortworthbased', 'carrier', 'storage', 'another', 'order', 'type', 'ground', 'follow', 'deadly', 'crash', 'indication', 'recertificated', 'return', 'revenue', 'service', 'federal', 'administration', 'continue', 'scrutinize', 'far', 'certification', 'test', 'schedule', 'american', 'expect', 'gradually', 'phase', 'commercial', 'service', 'increase', 'fly', 'throughout', 'month', 'august', 'september', 'add', 'since', 'american', 'gradually', 'phase', 'operation', 'course', 'month', 'additional', 'refinement', 'schedule', 'may', 'american', 'executive', 'told', 'analyst', 'fullyear', 'earnings', 'call', 'january', 'force', 'cancel', 'alone', 'final', 'quarter', 'due', 'ground', 'say', 'expect', 'book', 'loss', 'similar', 'fullyear', 'loss', 'incur']"
"Indian budget carrier SpiceJet saw a 33% year-on-year uptick in operational profit during the third quarter following the expansion of its fleet and addition of new routes in 2019. Operating profit rose to Rs732 million ($10 million) during the third quarter ending in December, up from Rs550 million for the same period in 2018. Operating revenue rose 47% year-on-year to Rs36.5 billion. Increased revenue was partially offset by a 52% year-on-year rise in expenses from Rs25 billion during the third quarter of 2018 to Rs38 billion in 2019. Unfavorable foreign exchange rates and increased maintenance costs contributed to rising expenses. Cost per available seat kilometer (CASKM) rose by 2% year-on-year, while revenue per available seat kilometer (RASKM) shrank by 2%. Capacity, in ASKs, grew by 59% year-on-year during the third quarter as SpiceJet ended the year with 119 aircraft. The carrier's growth plans were stunted, however, with 13 Boeing 737 Max jets remaining in storage since March due to the worldwide grounding of the aircraft. The absence of Max aircraft from the airline's schedules is an “unprecedented crisis”, SpiceJet chairman Ajay Singh states in the earnings release. SpiceJet has 155 firm orders of 737 Max jets, having signed letter of intents for an additional 50 Max aircraft, Cirium fleets data shows. “We were expecting the Max to return to service by January 2020 but that hasn't happened,” Singh says. “The continued grounding and the delay in its return to service has undoubtedly hit our growth plans adversely and resulted in inefficient operations and increased costs. That said, SpiceJet, expects to grow profitably while maintaining a tight control over costs.” The carrier is studying an offer from Boeing to compensate the carrier for the grounding of Max jets, which could be in the form of cash or other assets or services. During the third quarter, the airline added 65 new domestic flights, increasing connectivity between hubs and regional destinations within India. It became the first carrier to launch a nonstop flight between Ahmedabad and Aurangabad; Pune and Jodhpur; and Chennai and Durgapur. SpiceJet's steps to strengthen its network during the third quarter also included signing a codeshare agreement with Emirates Airline and a memorandum of understanding with Gulf Air for interline and codeshare agreements. These will open SpiceJet's network to fly directly to Bahrain for the first time and will increase options for flights through Dubai.",2,674,3.0,0.3643,"passenger, loss, operating, revenue, traffic, month, increase, capacity, decline, result","['indian', 'budget', 'carrier', 'spicejet', 'saw', 'yearonyear', 'uptick', 'operational', 'profit', 'third', 'quarter', 'follow', 'expansion', 'fleet', 'addition', 'route', 'operating', 'profit', 'rise', 'third', 'quarter', 'end', 'december', 'period', 'operating', 'revenue', 'rise', 'yearonyear', 'increase', 'revenue', 'partially', 'offset', 'yearonyear', 'rise', 'expense', 'third', 'quarter', 'unfavorable', 'foreign', 'exchange', 'rate', 'increase', 'maintenance', 'cost', 'contribute', 'rise', 'expense', 'cost', 'per', 'available', 'seat', 'kilometer', 'caskm', 'rise', 'yearonyear', 'revenue', 'per', 'available', 'seat', 'kilometer', 'raskm', 'shrank', 'capacity', 'asks', 'grow', 'yearonyear', 'third', 'quarter', 'spicejet', 'end', 'carrier', 'growth', 'plan', 'stunt', 'however', 'jet', 'remain', 'storage', 'since', 'march', 'due', 'worldwide', 'ground', 'absence', 'schedule', 'unprecedented', 'crisis', 'spicejet', 'chairman', 'ajay', 'singh', 'state', 'earnings', 'release', 'spicejet', 'firm', 'order', 'jet', 'sign', 'letter', 'intent', 'additional', 'fleet', 'data', 'expect', 'return', 'service', 'january', 'happen', 'singh', 'say', 'continued', 'ground', 'delay', 'return', 'service', 'undoubtedly', 'hit', 'growth', 'plan', 'adversely', 'result', 'inefficient', 'operation', 'increase', 'cost', 'say', 'spicejet', 'expect', 'grow', 'profitably', 'maintain', 'tight', 'control', 'carrier', 'study', 'offer', 'compensate', 'carrier', 'ground', 'jet', 'form', 'cash', 'asset', 'service', 'third', 'quarter', 'add', 'domestic', 'increase', 'connectivity', 'hub', 'regional', 'destination', 'within', 'india', 'become', 'carrier', 'launch', 'nonstop', 'ahmedabad', 'aurangabad', 'pune', 'jodhpur', 'chennai', 'durgapur', 'spicejet', 'step', 'strengthen', 'network', 'third', 'quarter', 'include', 'signing', 'codeshare', 'agreement', 'emirate', 'memorandum', 'understand', 'gulf', 'interline', 'codeshare', 'agreement', 'open', 'spicejet', 'network', 'fly', 'directly', 'bahrain', 'increase', 'option', 'dubai']"
"Turkey's directorate general of civil aviation has confirmed that struggling carrier AtlasGlobal has suspended flights and is to file for bankruptcy. Reports in the Turkish media emerged on 12 February that AtlasGlobal was to pull the plug on operations, less than two months after resuming operations having first temporarily suspended flights last November. There has subsequently been no formal notice or comment from AtlasGlobal over the reports, which cited a meeting held on 12 February at which staff were told the airline was stopping flights. AtlasGlobal flights have not been showing today on the online departures information at its home Istanbul airport. Today, in a post from its official Twitter account, Turkey's directorate general of civil aviation says: “Atlasjet Airlines filed for bankruptcy because their operations could not continue and their flights were stopped.” AtlasGlobal was known as Atlasjet from its launch in 2001, before later rebranding. There remains no confirmation of the move on AtlasGlobal's website. The Turkish carrier had been forced to suspend flights on 26 November owing to financial challenges.

"United Airlines has taken the Boeing 737 Max out of its summer peak schedule as the beleaguered aircraft's path to return to revenue service remains unclear. It will not return the aircraft to its schedule until at least 4 September, the Chicago-based airline says on 14 February. The move comes a day after Southwest Airlines, which operates an all-Boeing 737 fleet, pulled the aircraft out of its schedules until 10 August. American Airlines has suspended its Max fleet until June. ”We have decided to pull Max flights out of our schedule until Sept. 4, 2020,” the airline says in a statement. “During this period, we'll continue to take extraordinary steps to protect our customers' travel plans. Moving forward, we'll continue to monitor the regulatory process and nimbly make the necessary adjustments to our operation and our schedule to benefit our customers who are traveling with us.” ”By moving the return to service date back past peak summer travel season it allows us to have more certainty by providing our customers and our operation a firmer and more definitive timeline,” the airline adds. United says it expects to cancel between 56 and 108 flights every day, or between 1,600 and 3,300 fligths every month, between now and September as a result of the aircraft's ongoing grounding. ”We are continuing to work through the schedule to try and swap and upgauge aircraft to mitigate the disruption caused by the grounding of the Max,” the airline says. ”We continue to automatically book affected customers on alternate flights.” United has 14 Maxes in its fleet, which are currently in storage. Sixteen more have been built and are grounded at Boeing facilities and awaiting delivery, and 155 more on order, United says. ”We have not made our delivery timeline public, and with the continued grounding and unknown return to service date, we will continue to not have a firm date for delivery of our remaining Max orders.” Last week, US Federal Aviation Administration head Steve Dickson indicated that the 737 Max could commence certification flights within a few weeks, although certain issues with the aircraft still need to be resolved. There is still no timeline for the aircraft to return to service. Problems with the new-generation aircraft have repeatedly delayed its return to service after it was grounded in March 2019 following two crashes that killed 346 people.",2,676,11.0,0.1796,"pilot, faa, issue, safety, include, report, require, training, ground, order","['united', 'take', 'summer', 'peak', 'schedule', 'beleaguer', 'path', 'return', 'revenue', 'service', 'remains', 'unclear', 'return', 'schedule', 'least', 'september', 'chicagobased', 'say', 'february', 'move', 'come', 'day', 'southwest', 'operates', 'allboeing', 'fleet', 'pull', 'schedule', 'august', 'american', 'suspend', 'fleet', 'june', 'decide', 'pull', 'schedule', 'say', 'statement', 'period', 'continue', 'take', 'extraordinary', 'step', 'protect', 'customer', 'travel', 'plan', 'move', 'forward', 'continue', 'monitor', 'regulatory', 'process', 'nimbly', 'make', 'necessary', 'adjustment', 'operation', 'schedule', 'benefit', 'customer', 'travel', 'move', 'return', 'service', 'date', 'back', 'past', 'peak', 'summer', 'travel', 'season', 'allows', 'u', 'certainty', 'provide', 'customer', 'operation', 'firmer', 'definitive', 'timeline', 'add', 'united', 'say', 'expect', 'cancel', 'every', 'day', 'fligths', 'every', 'month', 'september', 'result', 'ongoing', 'ground', 'continue', 'work', 'schedule', 'try', 'swap', 'upgauge', 'mitigate', 'disruption', 'cause', 'ground', 'say', 'continue', 'automatically', 'book', 'affected', 'customer', 'alternate', 'united', 'fleet', 'currently', 'storage', 'sixteen', 'built', 'ground', 'facility', 'await', 'delivery', 'order', 'united', 'say', 'make', 'delivery', 'timeline', 'public', 'continued', 'ground', 'unknown', 'return', 'service', 'date', 'continue', 'firm', 'date', 'delivery', 'remain', 'week', 'u', 'federal', 'administration', 'head', 'steve', 'dickson', 'indicate', 'commence', 'certification', 'within', 'week', 'although', 'certain', 'issue', 'still', 'need', 'resolve', 'still', 'timeline', 'return', 'service', 'problem', 'newgeneration', 'repeatedly', 'delayed', 'return', 'service', 'ground', 'march', 'follow', 'crash', 'kill', 'people']"
"Singapore Airlines' group operating profit grew 15.7% during the third-quarter to S$449 million ($323 million) on the back of strong growth in the passenger business, and despite declining cargo earnings. Group revenue increased year-on-year by 3% to S$4.47 billion during the quarter ending 31 December 2019. This was driven by a S$239 million – or 7% – increase in passenger revenue, which, Singapore Airlines says, was boosted by the group's transformation programme that has increased sales and cut costs. Traffic grew 8.3%, while capacity as measured in ASKs increased by 4.9%. Cargo revenue, meanwhile, declined by S$112 million as freight yield fell 9.3% and load factor reduced by 4.6 percentage points to 61.4%. The airline cites trade uncertainties and a manufacturing slowdown in Europe and Asia as reasons for the decline. Singapore Airlines says its cargo arm “will continue to pursue charter opportunities and deploy to match demand”. Group expenditure increased S$68 million – or 1.7% – to S$4,022 million as a result of a $113 million rise in non-fuel costs. The airline attributes this to both the increase in capacity as well as higher traffic. Net fuel costs declined S$45 million mainly due to a fall in the average jet fuel price post-hedging. Singapore Airlines notes that the coronavirus outbreak poses “significant challenges” and that demand to mainland China has been severely affected. The airline group already has “drastically reduced” its services to the country and says it will be “proactive and nimble in making appropriate network adjustments and managing costs tightly”. The airline group has set up a dedicated “high-level task force” to monitor the situation and has started to disinfect aircraft cabins, modify in-flight services and has stopped crew layovers in China. Operating profit at Singapore Airlines' mainline grew 11.9% to S$413 million on the back of a 9.7% rise in traffic. The carrier increased capacity 6.9% during the quarter. Silk Air's S$7 million operating profit was flat compared with the same period the year before. The carrier's capacity shrunk 8.2%. Singapore Airlines says this was primarily attributable to the Boeing 737 Max grounding and a transfer of routes to budget subsidiary Scoot, as Silk Air is being integrated into the parent carrier. Scoot delivered an S$4 million operating profit, $3 million more than during the same period of 2018. The carrier's total revenue increased $15 million, while expenditure rose $12 million in line with capacity growth, Singapore Airlines says. Operating profit at the group's MRO arm SIA Engineering was stable at S$16 million. Revenue fell S$4 million due to a reduction in airframe and line maintenance revenue. But the company also reduced expenditure by $4 million, primarily as a result of lower material costs.",2,677,3.0,0.5241,"passenger, loss, operating, revenue, traffic, month, increase, capacity, decline, result","['singapore', 'operating', 'profit', 'grow', 'thirdquarter', 'back', 'strong', 'growth', 'passenger', 'business', 'despite', 'decline', 'cargo', 'earnings', 'revenue', 'increase', 'yearonyear', 'quarter', 'end', 'december', 'driven', 'increase', 'passenger', 'revenue', 'singapore', 'say', 'boost', 'transformation', 'programme', 'increase', 'sale', 'cut', 'cost', 'traffic', 'grow', 'capacity', 'measure', 'asks', 'increase', 'cargo', 'revenue', 'meanwhile', 'decline', 'freight', 'yield', 'fell', 'load', 'factor', 'reduce', 'percentage', 'point', 'cite', 'trade', 'uncertainty', 'manufacturing', 'slowdown', 'europe', 'asia', 'reason', 'decline', 'singapore', 'say', 'cargo', 'arm', 'continue', 'pursue', 'charter', 'opportunity', 'deploy', 'match', 'demand', 'expenditure', 'increase', 'result', 'rise', 'nonfuel', 'cost', 'attribute', 'increase', 'capacity', 'well', 'high', 'traffic', 'net', 'fuel', 'cost', 'decline', 'mainly', 'due', 'fall', 'average', 'jet', 'fuel', 'price', 'posthedging', 'singapore', 'note', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'pose', 'significant', 'challenge', 'demand', 'mainland', 'severely', 'affected', 'already', 'drastically', 'reduce', 'service', 'country', 'say', 'proactive', 'nimble', 'make', 'appropriate', 'network', 'adjustment', 'manage', 'cost', 'tightly', 'set', 'dedicate', 'highlevel', 'task', 'force', 'monitor', 'situation', 'start', 'disinfect', 'cabin', 'modify', 'inflight', 'service', 'stop', 'crew', 'layover', 'operating', 'profit', 'singapore', 'mainline', 'grow', 'back', 'rise', 'traffic', 'carrier', 'increase', 'capacity', 'quarter', 'silk', 'operating', 'profit', 'flat', 'compare', 'period', 'carrier', 'capacity', 'shrunk', 'singapore', 'say', 'primarily', 'attributable', 'ground', 'transfer', 'route', 'budget', 'subsidiary', 'scoot', 'silk', 'integrate', 'parent', 'carrier', 'scoot', 'deliver', 'operating', 'profit', 'period', 'carrier', 'total', 'revenue', 'increase', 'expenditure', 'rise', 'line', 'capacity', 'growth', 'singapore', 'say', 'operating', 'profit', 'mro', 'arm', 'sia', 'engineering', 'stable', 'revenue', 'fell', 'due', 'reduction', 'airframe', 'line', 'maintenance', 'revenue', 'reduce', 'expenditure', 'primarily', 'result', 'low', 'material', 'cost']"
"Investigators have determined that a Bombardier Q400 crew engaged reverse thrust while airborne after failing to settle the aircraft on the runway during an unstable approach to Yangon. The Biman Bangladesh Airlines aircraft (S2-AGQ) subsequently lost height and airspeed, struck the runway and broke up. It had been inbound from Dhaka's Shahjalal airport, with 28 passengers and six crew members, on 8 May last year. The crew had already abandoned one approach at 2,000ft because airport operations were suspended for 30min, owing to heavy rain and lightning. The glideslope was out of service and only the localiser was available, so once the airport re-opened the Q400 crew commenced a non-precision approach to runway 21. Meteorological data shows variable winds at 10kt gusting to 20kt with 3,000m visibility and broken cloud at 1,000ft. The captain told the Myanmar accident investigation bureau that rain emerged on the final approach at 1,500ft. While the aircraft was on the centreline, he said, the aircraft was slightly higher than the normal 3° descent path, as revealed by the precision approach path indicator lamps. The first officer, who was flying, said the runway was visible, despite the rain, and claimed the aircraft landed smoothly. But the inquiry says the aircraft's airspeed had dropped below the target 135kt at about 450ft before increasing from about 160ft, reaching some 150kt at about 20ft. Flight-data recorder analysis indicates both pilots, at this point, were making pitch inputs to their control columns, in opposite directions – the captain pushing nose-down and the first officer pulling nose-up. The main landing-gear touched down intermittently – with “several” weight-on-wheels transitions – for about 5s before the aircraft's pitch started to increase and it became airborne again, rising to a height of 44ft. Power was reduced and the propellers were set to the beta range, essentially engaging reverse thrust while airborne. “Activation of beta range would reduce the lift production of the wing significantly, and cause a nose down pitching moment,” says the inquiry. The Q400's airspeed fell and, 13s after the initial touchdown, the aircraft struck the ground and exited the runway, suffering a landing-gear collapse and breaking into three sections. There were no fatalities but 12 of the 34 occupants were seriously injured. Investigators state that the approach was unstable but the crew did not execute a go-around. The inquiry adds, in its recommendations, that captain should take control of the aircraft in adverse weather conditions.",2,678,7.0,0.6061,"crew, runway, inquiry, land, approach, accident, investigator, captain, incident, pilot","['investigator', 'determine', 'bombardier', 'crew', 'engage', 'reverse', 'thrust', 'airborne', 'fail', 'settle', 'runway', 'unstable', 'approach', 'yangon', 'biman', 'bangladesh', 'subsequently', 'lose', 'height', 'airspeed', 'struck', 'runway', 'broke', 'inbound', 'dhaka', 'shahjalal', 'airport', 'passenger', 'crew', 'member', 'may', 'crew', 'already', 'abandon', 'approach', 'airport', 'operation', 'suspend', 'owe', 'heavy', 'rain', 'lightning', 'glideslope', 'service', 'localiser', 'available', 'airport', 'reopen', 'crew', 'commenced', 'nonprecision', 'approach', 'runway', 'meteorological', 'data', 'variable', 'wind', 'gusting', 'visibility', 'broken', 'cloud', 'captain', 'told', 'myanmar', 'accident', 'investigation', 'bureau', 'rain', 'emerge', 'final', 'approach', 'centreline', 'say', 'slightly', 'high', 'normal', 'descent', 'path', 'reveal', 'precision', 'approach', 'path', 'indicator', 'lamp', 'officer', 'fly', 'say', 'runway', 'visible', 'despite', 'rain', 'claimed', 'land', 'smoothly', 'inquiry', 'say', 'airspeed', 'drop', 'target', 'increase', 'reach', 'flightdata', 'recorder', 'analysis', 'indicates', 'pilot', 'point', 'make', 'pitch', 'input', 'control', 'column', 'opposite', 'direction', 'captain', 'push', 'nosedown', 'officer', 'pull', 'noseup', 'main', 'landinggear', 'touch', 'intermittently', 'several', 'weightonwheels', 'transition', 'pitch', 'start', 'increase', 'become', 'airborne', 'rise', 'height', 'power', 'reduce', 'propeller', 'set', 'beta', 'range', 'essentially', 'engage', 'reverse', 'thrust', 'airborne', 'activation', 'beta', 'range', 'reduce', 'lift', 'production', 'wing', 'significantly', 'cause', 'nose', 'pitch', 'moment', 'say', 'inquiry', 'airspeed', 'fell', 'initial', 'touchdown', 'struck', 'ground', 'exit', 'runway', 'suffer', 'landinggear', 'collapse', 'break', 'section', 'fatality', 'occupant', 'seriously', 'injured', 'investigator', 'state', 'approach', 'unstable', 'crew', 'execute', 'goaround', 'inquiry', 'add', 'recommendation', 'captain', 'take', 'control', 'adverse', 'weather', 'condition']"
"Russian authorities have detailed a serious incident during which an Aeroflot Boeing 777-300ER captured a false glideslope on approach to the new runway 24R at Moscow Sheremetyevo, descending to low altitude before executing a go-around. The incident occurred on 18 December and involved a go-around after the ground-proximity warning system sounded, according to a communication from federal air transport regulator Rosaviatsia. Sheremetyevo's runway 24R, the airport's third, opened in September last year but Moscow residents, particularly those in high-rise apartment buildings in the Lobnya district to the east, have expressed concerns about noise and the proximity of aircraft. In December a local campaign group publicly highlighted an incident in which an aircraft had been observed at low altitude – the group claimed it was below the sixth floor of a high-rise – descending through fog while still 5km from the airport. Rosaviatsia has confirmed, in a 4 February communication, the campaign group's suspicions that an Aeroflot 777 was involved. It says the descent below the correct approach path to 24R occurred as a result of aircraft systems capturing a false glideslope – but has not elaborated on this claim. Aeroflot conducted an investigation into the triggering of the ground-proximity system, says Rosaviatsia, which turned up breaches in the established procedures for carrying out an approach to runway 24R, adding that the captain was subsequently dismissed and additional training ordered. Rosaviatsia adds that the Russian state air traffic management corporation carried out further analysis of the 777 flight – the SU209 service from Shanghai – with the intent of providing crews with effective information about deviations from approach paths. Sheremetyevo's air navigation service is also set to receive new systems over 2020-21 to enhance control capabilities for the third runway. Rosaviatsia says that it believes the measures taken by Aeroflot and the air navigation service are “sufficient” to eliminate the shortcomings.",2,679,7.0,0.4442,"crew, runway, inquiry, land, approach, accident, investigator, captain, incident, pilot","['russian', 'authority', 'detailed', 'serious', 'incident', 'aeroflot', 'capture', 'false', 'glideslope', 'approach', 'runway', 'moscow', 'sheremetyevo', 'descend', 'low', 'altitude', 'execute', 'goaround', 'incident', 'occur', 'december', 'involve', 'goaround', 'groundproximity', 'warn', 'system', 'sound', 'accord', 'communication', 'federal', 'transport', 'regulator', 'rosaviatsia', 'sheremetyevo', 'runway', 'airport', 'third', 'open', 'september', 'moscow', 'resident', 'particularly', 'highrise', 'apartment', 'building', 'lobnya', 'district', 'east', 'express', 'concern', 'noise', 'proximity', 'december', 'local', 'campaign', 'publicly', 'highlight', 'incident', 'observe', 'low', 'altitude', 'claimed', 'sixth', 'floor', 'highrise', 'descend', 'fog', 'still', 'airport', 'rosaviatsia', 'confirm', 'february', 'communication', 'campaign', 'suspicion', 'aeroflot', 'involve', 'say', 'descent', 'correct', 'approach', 'path', 'occur', 'result', 'system', 'capture', 'false', 'glideslope', 'elaborate', 'claim', 'aeroflot', 'conduct', 'investigation', 'trigger', 'groundproximity', 'system', 'say', 'rosaviatsia', 'turn', 'breach', 'establish', 'procedure', 'carry', 'approach', 'runway', 'add', 'captain', 'subsequently', 'dismiss', 'additional', 'training', 'order', 'rosaviatsia', 'add', 'russian', 'state', 'traffic', 'management', 'corporation', 'carry', 'far', 'analysis', 'service', 'shanghai', 'intent', 'provide', 'crew', 'effective', 'information', 'deviation', 'approach', 'path', 'sheremetyevo', 'navigation', 'service', 'set', 'receive', 'system', 'enhance', 'control', 'capability', 'third', 'runway', 'rosaviatsia', 'say', 'believe', 'measure', 'take', 'aeroflot', 'navigation', 'service', 'sufficient', 'eliminate', 'shortcoming']"
"AVIC says that its MA700 turboprop production is still on schedule, despite the Covid-19 outbreak in China. The Chinese airframer says it restarted production of the MA700 on 10 February, after production was halted for an undisclosed period.

"Preliminary estimates by ICAO indicate that the ongoing Covid-19 outbreak could wipe out $4-5 billion in airline revenues for the current quarter. This is based on assumptions that overall passenger capacity will decline by 39-41%, equivalent to a reduction of 16.4 to 19.6 million passengers. The estimated financial loss, however, does not take into reduction in Chinese domestic air traffic, or to and from Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. ICAO states that about 70 airlines – including American Airlines and the Lufthansa group – have cancelled all international flights to and from mainland China, the epicentre of the Covid-19 outbreak. Another 50 carriers, such as Singapore Airlines and Cathay Pacific, have reduced capacity. “This has resulted in an 80% reduction of foreign airline capacity for travellers directly to/from China, and a 40% capacity reduction by Chinese airlines,” ICAO states. This contrasts sharply with a planned increase in capacity of 9% year-on-year for the first quarter of 2020. It echoed sentiments that the Covid-19 outbreak will hit the airline industry harder than the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak of 2003. This was due to the higher volume of flights to and from China, as well as the extent of flight cancellations seen so far. “Seasonal passenger load factors are another extenuating factor, as is the fact that China's international air traffic has doubled, and its domestic traffic increased five-fold, since the 2003 period,” ICAO adds. It has stressed that the figures were preliminary estimates, and that more comprehensive assessments were needed to fully determine the virus outbreak's economic impact. The Covid-19 outbreak has hit more than 20 countries globally, with most of the confirmed cases and deaths occurring in China.

"Aircraft lessor Avolon says the delivery delays blighting the Airbus A321neo are not expected to ease until 2022. This is later than Airbus had been publically stating late last year. John Higgins, Avolon's president and chief commercial officer, told Cirium that Airbus's remediation programme for the A321 – the aircraft type facing the most severe problems – foresees delays remaining throughout 2021 and as far as spring 2022. “That's very frustrating for us and for our customers. It has an impact,” he says. “There are mechanisms in our purchase agreement where we are entitled to compensation for delayed delivery and we are not shy about pursuing that.” Airbus has been suffering ongoing production problems with the A321neo as it works through the complexity of producing three versions simultaneously – the A321ceo, A321neo and A321 ACF/LR. Speaking at the Dubai air show in November 2019, Airbus chief executive Guillaume Faury talked of the dual problems of “a ramp-up in numbers and ramp-up in complexity”. But he stated his confidence that the issues had been stabilised and projected that the issues would be resolved during 2021. “Our priority is to prepare the production system for sustainable long-term growth with more A321s. That's one of the areas of challenge we have to manage,” he said. “We are stabilising our delays in spite of the ramp-up, and then from 2021 we want to be back on track. Between stabilising and resolving, it takes more time.” This article is based on quotes from a wider Cirium interview with Avolon president John Higgins with additional reporting by Max Kingsley-Jones",2,682,2.0,0.2456,"executive, chief, cut, add, situation, staff, crisis, make, coronavirus, employee","['lessor', 'avolon', 'say', 'delivery', 'delay', 'blighting', 'expect', 'ease', 'later', 'publically', 'state', 'late', 'john', 'higgins', 'avolon', 'president', 'chief', 'commercial', 'officer', 'told', 'remediation', 'programme', 'type', 'face', 'severe', 'problem', 'foresees', 'delay', 'remain', 'throughout', 'far', 'spring', 'frustrate', 'u', 'customer', 'impact', 'say', 'mechanism', 'purchase', 'agreement', 'entitle', 'compensation', 'delayed', 'delivery', 'shy', 'pursue', 'suffer', 'ongoing', 'production', 'problem', 'work', 'complexity', 'produce', 'version', 'simultaneously', 'speak', 'dubai', 'november', 'chief', 'executive', 'guillaume', 'faury', 'talk', 'dual', 'problem', 'rampup', 'number', 'rampup', 'complexity', 'state', 'confidence', 'issue', 'stabilise', 'project', 'issue', 'resolve', 'priority', 'prepare', 'production', 'system', 'sustainable', 'longterm', 'growth', 'area', 'challenge', 'manage', 'say', 'stabilise', 'delay', 'spite', 'rampup', 'want', 'back', 'track', 'stabilise', 'resolve', 'take', 'article', 'base', 'quote', 'wider', 'interview', 'avolon', 'president', 'john', 'higgins', 'additional', 'reporting', 'kingsleyjones']"
"South African carrier Comair warns that it expects to post a loss for the six months ending 31 December 2019 because of the ongoing Boeing 737 Max grounding and an unpaid debt by South African Airways. The British Airways franchise partner, which also operates budget unit Kulula, says in a notice to the Johannesburg Stock exchange that its earnings per share for the first half of its financial year are expected to be more than 170% lower than the comparable period of 2018. The carrier attributes the loss to increased operating costs from replacing five owned Boeing 737-400s with five leased 737-800s, as well as increased line maintenance costs arising from the transition of its fleet from SAA Technical to Lufthansa Technik. “Furthermore, earnings continue to be negatively impacted by cumulative losses incurred as a result of the ongoing grounding of the Boeing 737 Max 8,” statesComair, adding that compensation negotiations are “underway” with Boeing but remain unresolved as yet. Comair had taken delivery of one Max 8 before the grounding took effect. It was due to receive a second in March 2019 and a third this month. The airline says it has received “no revised delivery dates” from Boeing. Adding to the carrier's woes, South African Airways last year agreed to pay Comair Rs1 billion ($67.4 million) over the course of a period beginning on 28 February 2019 and ending 28 July 2022, in order to settle a long-running legal dispute over travel-agency incentive schemes. However,Comair states that SAA “failed to make the payment of the capital and interest amount due on 28 December 2019” and is now “in breach of its obligations in terms of the settlement agreement”. The carrier adds that SAA still owes it Rs790 million but says “the future recoverability of the outstanding amount is uncertain” because SAA has now been placed under business rescue.",2,683,8.0,0.3058,"government, uk, carrier, business, state, share, south, airway, financial, plan","['south', 'african', 'carrier', 'comair', 'warns', 'expect', 'post', 'loss', 'month', 'end', 'december', 'ongoing', 'ground', 'unpaid', 'debt', 'south', 'african', 'airway', 'british', 'airway', 'franchise', 'partner', 'operates', 'budget', 'unit', 'kulula', 'say', 'notice', 'johannesburg', 'stock', 'exchange', 'earnings', 'per', 'share', 'half', 'financial', 'expect', 'low', 'comparable', 'period', 'carrier', 'attribute', 'loss', 'increase', 'operating', 'cost', 'replace', 'lease', 'well', 'increase', 'line', 'maintenance', 'cost', 'arise', 'transition', 'fleet', 'saa', 'technical', 'lufthansa', 'technik', 'furthermore', 'earnings', 'continue', 'negatively', 'impact', 'cumulative', 'loss', 'incur', 'result', 'ongoing', 'ground', 'statescomair', 'add', 'compensation', 'negotiation', 'underway', 'remain', 'unresolved', 'yet', 'comair', 'take', 'delivery', 'ground', 'take', 'effect', 'due', 'receive', 'second', 'march', 'third', 'month', 'say', 'receive', 'revise', 'delivery', 'date', 'add', 'carrier', 'woe', 'south', 'african', 'airway', 'agree', 'pay', 'comair', 'course', 'period', 'begin', 'february', 'end', 'july', 'order', 'settle', 'longrunning', 'legal', 'dispute', 'travelagency', 'incentive', 'scheme', 'however', 'comair', 'state', 'saa', 'fail', 'make', 'payment', 'capital', 'interest', 'amount', 'due', 'december', 'breach', 'obligation', 'term', 'settlement', 'agreement', 'carrier', 'add', 'saa', 'still', 'owes', 'say', 'future', 'recoverability', 'outstanding', 'amount', 'uncertain', 'saa', 'place', 'business', 'rescue']"
"Airbus is to cut production of its A330 line to 40 aircraft this year, and will keep A350 monthly output to between nine and 10 aircraft. The decision is a consequence of “overall customer demand” in the twin-aisle sector, says the airframer. Chief executive Guillaume Faury, speaking in Toulouse on 13 February, said the airframer “wanted to have a level of production reflecting demand moving forward” and that the decision reflected Airbus's understanding of the “capacity of the market”. Softer long-haul demand has been reflected in rival Boeing's plans to cut 787 monthly production from 14 aircraft to 10 in 2021. The US airframer attributed this to Chinese trade tension and lower near-term replacement demand. Airbus delivered 53 A330s last year, including 41 of the re-engined A330neo. But Faury says a “lot” of the A330 deliveries last year involved aircraft originally produced in 2018, for which delivery was then delayed. He says he is “confident” that the airframer is planning fro the “right level” of deliveries. Airbus also handed over 112 A350s – comprising 87 A350-900s and 25 A350-1000s – having achieved its target production rate of 10 aircraft per month. It increased overall A350 orders to 926 during 2019, up by 32, but the backlog for the twinjet family fell by 80 aircraft – to 579 – over the year. The backlog for the A330 programme, in contrast, increased by 36 aircraft to 331 by the end of 2019, of which 293 are A330neos.  All of the A330neo deliveries to date have involved the larger -900 variant. Certification of the -800 has yet to be completed. But Airbus chief executive Guillaume Faury says the airframer expects developments on the type certificate for the A330-800 “very soon”.",2,684,0.0,0.4064,"order, business, jet, delivery, production, customer, deliver, commercial, quarter, include","['cut', 'production', 'line', 'keep', 'monthly', 'output', 'decision', 'consequence', 'overall', 'customer', 'demand', 'twinaisle', 'sector', 'say', 'airframer', 'chief', 'executive', 'guillaume', 'faury', 'speak', 'toulouse', 'february', 'say', 'airframer', 'want', 'level', 'production', 'reflect', 'demand', 'move', 'forward', 'decision', 'reflect', 'understand', 'capacity', 'market', 'softer', 'longhaul', 'demand', 'reflect', 'rival', 'plan', 'cut', 'monthly', 'production', 'u', 'airframer', 'attribute', 'chinese', 'trade', 'tension', 'low', 'nearterm', 'replacement', 'demand', 'deliver', 'include', 'reengined', 'faury', 'say', 'lot', 'delivery', 'involve', 'originally', 'produce', 'delivery', 'delayed', 'say', 'confident', 'airframer', 'planning', 'fro', 'right', 'level', 'delivery', 'hand', 'comprise', 'achieve', 'target', 'production', 'rate', 'per', 'month', 'increase', 'overall', 'order', 'backlog', 'twinjet', 'family', 'fell', 'backlog', 'programme', 'contrast', 'increase', 'end', 'delivery', 'date', 'involve', 'large', 'variant', 'certification', 'yet', 'complete', 'chief', 'executive', 'guillaume', 'faury', 'say', 'airframer', 'expect', 'development', 'type', 'certificate', 'soon']"
"For US Marine Corps (USMC) F-35B demo pilot Captain Taylor Zehrung, and US Air Force (USAF) F-22 demo pilot Major Joshua Gunderson, aggressive flight manoeuvres, such as the ones displayed at the Singapore air show, are just part of the everyday job of combat aviation. Both pilots say what was asked of them could be performed by any members of their squadrons. “Our demos are designed to demonstrate what the aircraft can do in a combat scenario,” says Gunderson. “Everything is very specific in terms of airspeed, altitudes, [and] parameters, because I'm making sure it's repeatable and executable and safe. But you can take any pilot in the F-22 community, give them a couple rides in this and they'll be proficient at doing it.” In particular, the pilots say the manoeuvres are something that are practiced regularly in combat exercises. “The minimum radius turn we definitely use in basic fighter manoeuvres against other aircraft,” says Gunderson. “What's great about the F-22 is our thrust out of the back end. The flight control computers allow us to turn very quickly in a very tight space, which gives us an advantage in the fight.” The Lockheed Martin F-22 has two Pratt & Whitney F119 engines which each produce 35,000lb-thrust (156kN). Gunderson also highlighted the J-Turn, a manoeuvre where the F-22 rockets upward at a high angle of attack, stalls and then pivots in a new direction while falling back to earth using its fly-by-wire flight controls and thrust-vectored jet engines. “That'd be an example where you can quickly change your nose position, whether you want to get weapons on something, or just continue to get an offensive position really quickly,” says Gunderson. For F-35B pilot Zehrung learning short-take-off-and-vertical-landing (STOVL) manoeuvres, including the in-flight hover, took some getting used to. The F-35B can hover and complete STOVL manoeuvres using a shaft-driven lift fan system in its body and thrust-vectored tail exhaust. “The very first time I ever did it, it was very weird being in fighter jet and not moving,” he says. “But it's become pretty normal now.” F-22 pilot Gunderson is the USAF F-22 Demonstration Team commander and is based at Joint Base Langley-Eustis in Hampton, Virginia. F-22 pilots perform aerial displays as part of two-year rotations. F-35B pilot Zehrung is part of the USMC's F-35B Lighting II aerial demonstration team, which is part of attack squadron 121 at Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni, Japan.

"Heavy penalties on Airbus imposed under the €3.6 billion deferred prosecution agreement, as well as other charges, have cut into the company's full-year results, leading to its formally reporting a consolidated net loss of €1.36 billion. The penalty is part of an overall €5.6 billion negative impact on the full-year figures which also include a €1.2 billion charge relating to the A400M military programme. Airbus is also taking €200 million in charges over the terminated A380 programme and €221 million in relation to suspended defence export licences to Saudi Arabia by the German government. The company's consolidated EBIT figure fell from €5.05 billion in 2018 to €1.34 billion in 2019, and the net loss reached €1.36 billion. For the fourth quarter Airbus turned in a net loss of €3.55 billion. Commercial aircraft revenues for the year were up 14% to €54.8 billion and – although reported EBIT halved to €2.2 billion – adjusted EBIT was up 32% to €6.36 billion. Despite the financial burden from the deferred prosecution agreement, relating to alleged corruption in the commercial and defence aircraft sales sector, the airframer is upbeat. “We delivered a strong underlying financial performance driven mainly by our commercial aircraft deliveries,” says Airbus chief executive Guillaume Faury. “Our focus in 2020 will be on reinforcing our company culture, improving operationally, and adjusting our cost structure to strengthen the financial performance and prepare for the future.”",2,686,3.0,0.2431,"passenger, loss, operating, revenue, traffic, month, increase, capacity, decline, result","['heavy', 'penalty', 'impose', 'defer', 'prosecution', 'agreement', 'well', 'charge', 'cut', 'fullyear', 'result', 'lead', 'formally', 'reporting', 'consolidated', 'net', 'loss', 'penalty', 'part', 'overall', 'negative', 'impact', 'fullyear', 'figure', 'include', 'charge', 'relate', 'military', 'programme', 'take', 'charge', 'terminate', 'programme', 'relation', 'suspend', 'defence', 'export', 'licence', 'saudi', 'arabia', 'german', 'government', 'consolidated', 'ebit', 'figure', 'fell', 'net', 'loss', 'reach', 'fourth', 'quarter', 'turn', 'net', 'loss', 'commercial', 'revenue', 'although', 'report', 'ebit', 'halve', 'adjust', 'ebit', 'despite', 'financial', 'burden', 'defer', 'prosecution', 'agreement', 'relate', 'allege', 'corruption', 'commercial', 'defence', 'sale', 'sector', 'airframer', 'upbeat', 'deliver', 'strong', 'underlie', 'financial', 'performance', 'driven', 'mainly', 'commercial', 'delivery', 'say', 'chief', 'executive', 'guillaume', 'faury', 'focus', 'reinforce', 'culture', 'improve', 'operationally', 'adjust', 'cost', 'structure', 'strengthen', 'financial', 'performance', 'prepare', 'future']"

Mnuchin adds that the US government will “not allow” Maduro and his “proxies” to misuse state-owned assets for destabilising activity. “This action does not prevent the ability of the Venezuelan people to travel, as they can continue to travel on various other carriers not subject to [US sanctions],” the treasury states. “This action is intended to curtail the Maduro regime's misuse of the airline.”",2,689,8.0,0.2066,"government, uk, carrier, business, state, share, south, airway, financial, plan","['venezuelan', 'carrier', 'conviasa', 'subject', 'tighter', 'sanction', 'u', 'government', 'intend', 'prevent', 'allege', 'presidential', 'misuse', 'u', 'treasury', 'office', 'foreign', 'asset', 'control', 'formally', 'list', 'conviasa', 'fleet', 'block', 'venezuelan', 'government', 'property', 'fleet', 'include', 'embraer', 'ejets', 'plus', 'atr', 'turboprop', 'number', 'miscellaneous', 'among', 'add', 'carrier', 'speciallydesignated', 'national', 'list', 'intend', 'ensure', 'strengthen', 'compliance', 'sanction', 'say', 'treasury', 'secretary', 'steven', 'mnuchin', 'claim', 'illegitimate', 'regime', 'venezuelan', 'president', 'nicolas', 'maduro', 'conviasa', 'shuttle', 'official', 'various', 'destination', 'iran', 'cuba', 'north', 'korea', 'fuel', 'support', 'antidemocratic', 'effort', 'mnuchin', 'add', 'u', 'government', 'allow', 'maduro', 'proxy', 'misuse', 'stateowned', 'asset', 'destabilise', 'activity', 'action', 'prevent', 'ability', 'venezuelan', 'people', 'travel', 'continue', 'travel', 'various', 'carrier', 'subject', 'u', 'sanction', 'treasury', 'state', 'action', 'intend', 'curtail', 'maduro', 'regime', 'misuse']"
"Russian airframer VASO has completed the first engine pylons for the Irkut MC-21 intended for installation of Aviadvigatel PD-14 powerplants. The Voronezh-based manufacturer says the latest assemblies bring the total number of pylon sets to 12. While MC-21s so far assembled have all comprised Pratt & Whitney PW1400G-powered airframes, Irkut is manufacturing the first with the Russian-built PD-14 engine. “Our plant had the task of completing the final assembly of [PD-14] pylons by the end of January, and it was achieved in full,” says VASO acting managing director Alexander Yarchevsky. “We've built PD-14 pylons for the MC-21 for the first time.” Yarchevsky says the pylons are “complex” but nearly all the components – including the fuel and hydraulic systems, fire-protection equipment, and air conditioning parts – are manufactured in the company's facilities. Upon completion of acceptance, the pylons will be transferred to the Irkut assembly line. The first PD-14-powered aircraft is undergoing wing and fuselage mating. VASO also supplies fairings and other components for the PD-14 engine nacelles which have already been shipped to the facility in Irkutsk. Yarchevsky says another three sets of pylons for the MC-21 are scheduled to be manufactured this year. VASO is producing up to 12% of the components for the twinjet, including composite hatches, flap fairings, wing-fuselage fairings, and parts for the horizontal stabiliser and vertical fin.

"Nigerian investigators have disclosed that an engine pod-strike involving a Max Air Boeing 747-400 resulted in the powerplant's shedding its cowls as it rolled out after landing at Minna. The country's Accident Investigation Bureau says the captain, who was flying, had remarked that the ILS signal was “erratic” on both the glideslope and the localiser as the aircraft descended through 2,000ft. At this point, it states, the autopilot was disengaged and the 747's approach was flown manually using visual references. The aircraft was right of the centreline as it crossed the threshold of runway 05 – not runway 23 as investigators originally believed – after arriving on 7 September last year. While correcting the course, says the inquiry in its preliminary findings, the captain “over-banked” the aircraft and – as its left-hand main landing-gear touched down – its outboard left-hand engine pod struck the runway 203m from the threshold. It scraped along the runway for 44m, causing abrasion to the underside nacelle cowl latches sufficient for them to release. The cowls then opened and were torn off the engine in the slipstream. The aircraft settled on all its main landing-gear and decelerated to a halt, with damage to the engine's lower intake, fan and reverser cowl, and a punctured fairing on the left wing. Inspectors also found damage to a runway edge light. None of the 578 occupants of the 747, including 18 crew members, was injured. The Pratt & Whitney PW4000-powered aircraft (5N-DBK) had been carrying out a pilgrimage flight from Jeddah. The inquiry notes that the first officer had mentioned to Minna controllers before reaching 20nm inbound about the possibility of bird activity – evidence of bird-strike was later discovered on the 747's radome. After being cleared for the ILS approach to runway 05, the crew requested to deviate left and extend the downwind leg to avoid storms, before clearing the weather and establishing the jet on the localiser for runway 05. No cockpit conversation was captured because the voice recorder was unserviceable. The inquiry has not given much more detail on the captain's complaint of erratic ILS signals, although it says the crew reported to Minna tower that the localiser was “not well calibrated”.

"London Gatwick, Rome and Washington Dulles are among a raft of international routes that are being suspended until the end of March by Cathay Pacific as it seeks to conserve cash during the ongoing coronavirus outbreak. The Hong Kong-based carrier had already cut 90% of its capacity into mainland China, where the virus started, and announced earlier this month that overall capacity would be slashed by 30% as a result of falling demand related to the outbreak.  Cathay has now detailed the international routes that will be affected, noting that temporary suspensions will be in place until 28 March on routes linking Hong Kong with London Gatwick, Rome, Washington Dulles, Newark, Male in the Maldives, Davao and Clark in the Philippines, Jeju in South Korea and Taichung in Taiwan. This is in addition to previously announced suspensions of mainland Chinese flights with the exception of those to Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu and Xiamen. Cathay serves both Heathrow and Gatwick in the UK, so will still operate flights to London during the suspension. The Oneworld member also serves New York JFK, and thus can continue to serve the US city despite the suspension of Newark. Earlier this month, the airline asked employees earlier this month to take three weeks of unpaid leave. In addition to the effects of the coronavirus outbreak, Cathay has been hit hard by political unrest in Hong Kong, where pro-democracy protests have been raging since June.",2,692,5.0,0.4633,"carrier, march, international, outbreak, suspend, capacity, schedule, april, united, coronavirus","['london', 'gatwick', 'rome', 'washington', 'dulles', 'among', 'raft', 'international', 'route', 'suspend', 'end', 'march', 'cathay', 'pacific', 'seek', 'conserve', 'cash', 'ongoing', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'hong', 'kongbased', 'carrier', 'already', 'cut', 'capacity', 'mainland', 'virus', 'start', 'announce', 'earlier', 'month', 'overall', 'capacity', 'slash', 'result', 'fall', 'demand', 'related', 'outbreak', 'cathay', 'detailed', 'international', 'route', 'affected', 'note', 'temporary', 'suspension', 'place', 'march', 'route', 'link', 'hong', 'kong', 'london', 'gatwick', 'rome', 'washington', 'dulles', 'newark', 'male', 'maldives', 'davao', 'clark', 'philippine', 'jeju', 'south', 'korea', 'taichung', 'taiwan', 'addition', 'previously', 'announce', 'suspension', 'mainland', 'chinese', 'exception', 'beijing', 'shanghai', 'chengdu', 'xiamen', 'cathay', 'serf', 'heathrow', 'gatwick', 'uk', 'still', 'operate', 'london', 'suspension', 'oneworld', 'member', 'serf', 'york', 'jfk', 'thus', 'continue', 'serve', 'u', 'city', 'despite', 'suspension', 'newark', 'earlier', 'month', 'ask', 'employee', 'earlier', 'month', 'take', 'week', 'unpaid', 'leave', 'addition', 'effect', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'cathay', 'hit', 'hard', 'political', 'unrest', 'hong', 'kong', 'prodemocracy', 'protest', 'rag', 'since', 'june']"
"Boeing received no new orders for large commercial aircraft in January, and delivered only 13 aircraft – a trickle of activity for a company long accustomed to big orders and dozens of monthly deliveries. The 13 deliveries included three 737NGs, among them one P-8A Poseidon reconnaissance aircraft to the US Navy and two commercial 737NGs to China Eastern Airlines. Boeing stopped assembling commercial 737NGs last year, but had not handed over all NGs to customers, the company says. It halted 737 production in January amid the Max grounding. The company halted 737 Max production in January. The other January deliveries included two 767-based KC-46A inflight refuelling tankers for the US Air Force, two 777s and six 787s, Boeing says. By comparison, in December 2019 Boeing delivered 35 large aircraft, among them six 737NGs, three 767s, five 777s and 21 787s. The company received orders for three new aircraft in December 2019, though it received cancellations for five aircraft, bringing the net number of orders in December to negative two.

"US Federal Aviation Administration chief Steve Dickson has set out the milestones that must be passed before the Boeing 737 Max can be returned to service. “The certification flight test, and then the evaluation of the certification flight, is really the next major milestone,” said Dickson during a briefing at the Singapore air show. “That's FAA pilots evaluating the compliance of the final software to FAA Transport Category aircraft regulations.” However, the flight test has not yet been scheduled. “We still have a few issues to resolve, but we are continuing to narrow the issues,” he says. “We are waiting for proposals from Boeing on a few items to be able to clear the way to that flight.” Elaborating on matters to be resolved, Dickson mentions an issue with the “stab out of trim” light, noting: “It's not a problem with the software per se, but this light that's been on the airplane forever tends to flicker when the trim is running very quickly...It's coming on at inappropriate times – it's essentially getting overloaded with data we think. They'll have to buffer that a little bit.” He adds: “We'll be addressing that, evaluating that. That's a matter of a few days.” In reference to a separate issue with wire bundles on the Max, Dickson says: “Boeing has not yet given us a proposal on that. We'll see to what extent those issues are common with the 737NG.” Once the certification flight has been completed and the data analysed “within a few days”, operational validation will proceed. Boeing has made a pilot-training proposal, which the FAA will evaluate, says Dickson – himself a pilot. “My deputy Dan Elwell is going to complete the training in conjunction with this. I'm also going to complete it subsequently before I fly the airplane,” says Dickson. “So we will be taking our own look at that.” But he adds: “We don't want to have our thumb on the scale. We've got international crews and US crews coming in to evaluate those proposals.” Thus will it be determined whether any modifications are required. “It's not a matter of us at this point accepting the Boeing proposal or not,” Dickson stresses. “We have a process to run that will give us the answer.” That process will take nine to 10 days, says Dickson. An amendment will then be made to the Flight Standardization Board (FSB) report – which will take “a few days” – and this will then be put out for public comment for 15 days. “From beginning to end, the JOEB [Joint Operations Evaluation Board] and FSB report process is roughly probably 30 days, and that can't happen until the certification flight.”  Subsequent processes include the final design documentation and the technical advisory board report. The FAA must also consider public responses to the master minimum equipment list that has been out for comment since 5 December, before it gets to the stage of issuing a continued airworthiness notification to the international community – providing notice of pending significant safety actions – and an airworthiness directive advising operators of the required corrective action. “We'll rescind the grounding order within a day or two after that,” says Dickson. After the issuance of certificates of airworthiness, US airlines will need to get their training programmes approved by the FAA. For now, though, the focus is on reaching the certification flight test. “If you look at it as a stream of work, it starts to break into some parallel streams once you get to that,” notes Dickson. The FAA is “following a very diligent process”, he says, adding: “It's important that we stay focused on the process and not on a timeline.” He vows that the Max will upon its return to service be “the most scrutinised aircraft in history”. The FAA will also impose a requirement that every Max operator around the world conduct a validation flight without passengers. Dickson also sketches how the whole process might affect future regulation: “The lessons learned will ideally lead to a more holistic rather than transactional item-by-item approach to aircraft certification – not only in the US, but around the world, where we will more effectively integrate human factors considerations throughout the design process as aircraft become more automated and systems more complex.”",2,694,11.0,0.5059,"pilot, faa, issue, safety, include, report, require, training, ground, order","['u', 'federal', 'administration', 'chief', 'steve', 'dickson', 'set', 'milestone', 'must', 'pass', 'return', 'service', 'certification', 'test', 'evaluation', 'certification', 'really', 'next', 'major', 'milestone', 'say', 'dickson', 'briefing', 'singapore', 'faa', 'pilot', 'evaluate', 'compliance', 'final', 'software', 'faa', 'transport', 'category', 'however', 'test', 'yet', 'schedule', 'still', 'issue', 'resolve', 'continue', 'narrow', 'issue', 'say', 'wait', 'proposal', 'item', 'able', 'clear', 'way', 'elaborate', 'matter', 'resolve', 'dickson', 'mention', 'issue', 'stab', 'trim', 'light', 'note', 'problem', 'software', 'per', 'se', 'light', 'airplane', 'forever', 'tends', 'flicker', 'trim', 'run', 'quickly', 'come', 'inappropriate', 'essentially', 'get', 'overload', 'data', 'think', 'buffer', 'little', 'add', 'address', 'evaluate', 'matter', 'reference', 'separate', 'issue', 'wire', 'bundle', 'dickson', 'say', 'yet', 'give', 'u', 'proposal', 'see', 'extent', 'issue', 'common', 'certification', 'complete', 'data', 'analyse', 'within', 'day', 'operational', 'validation', 'proceed', 'make', 'pilottraining', 'proposal', 'faa', 'evaluate', 'say', 'dickson', 'pilot', 'deputy', 'dan', 'elwell', 'go', 'complete', 'training', 'conjunction', 'go', 'complete', 'subsequently', 'fly', 'airplane', 'say', 'dickson', 'take', 'look', 'add', 'want', 'thumb', 'scale', 'get', 'international', 'crew', 'u', 'crew', 'come', 'evaluate', 'thus', 'determine', 'whether', 'modification', 'require', 'matter', 'u', 'point', 'accept', 'proposal', 'dickson', 'stress', 'process', 'run', 'give', 'u', 'process', 'take', 'day', 'say', 'dickson', 'amendment', 'make', 'standardization', 'board', 'fsb', 'report', 'take', 'day', 'put', 'public', 'comment', 'day', 'begin', 'end', 'joeb', 'joint', 'operation', 'evaluation', 'board', 'fsb', 'report', 'process', 'roughly', 'probably', 'day', 'ca', 'happen', 'certification', 'subsequent', 'process', 'include', 'final', 'design', 'documentation', 'technical', 'advisory', 'board', 'report', 'faa', 'must', 'consider', 'public', 'response', 'master', 'minimum', 'equipment', 'list', 'comment', 'since', 'december', 'get', 'stage', 'issue', 'continued', 'airworthiness', 'notification', 'international', 'community', 'provide', 'notice', 'pending', 'significant', 'safety', 'action', 'airworthiness', 'directive', 'advise', 'operator', 'require', 'corrective', 'action', 'rescind', 'ground', 'order', 'within', 'day', 'say', 'dickson', 'issuance', 'certificate', 'airworthiness', 'u', 'need', 'get', 'training', 'programme', 'approve', 'faa', 'though', 'focus', 'reach', 'certification', 'test', 'look', 'stream', 'work', 'start', 'break', 'parallel', 'stream', 'get', 'note', 'dickson', 'faa', 'follow', 'diligent', 'process', 'say', 'add', 'important', 'stay', 'focus', 'process', 'vow', 'upon', 'return', 'service', 'scrutinise', 'history', 'faa', 'impose', 'requirement', 'every', 'operator', 'around', 'world', 'conduct', 'validation', 'without', 'passenger', 'dickson', 'sketch', 'whole', 'process', 'might', 'affect', 'future', 'regulation', 'lesson', 'learn', 'ideally', 'lead', 'holistic', 'rather', 'transactional', 'itembyitem', 'approach', 'certification', 'u', 'around', 'world', 'effectively', 'integrate', 'human', 'factor', 'consideration', 'throughout', 'design', 'process', 'become', 'automate', 'system', 'complex']"

"AeroVironment hopes to clinch its first export order for the Switchblade loitering munition in 2020 following a change in attitude from the US authorities. Gerard Robottom, senior director for unmanned air systems international business development at AeroVironment, says the first international sale of the weapon - which it is displaying at the Singapore air show - should come in the next six to nine months. The US military has used the Switchblade for years, but the process of getting the weapon approved for international sales has been slow. AeroVironment has to abide by strict restrictions when marketing the loitering munition and prospective customers are directed to the US government if they want to learn anything more than the weapon's basic capabilities, says Robottom. However, the US government appears to have become more receptive to selling the Switchblade to certain countries within the last 12 months. “They had some barriers that they had to go through, and it's our understanding that US government is beyond those barriers for a small subset of their NATO customers,” he says. “They are allowing the small subset to move forward.” Robottom declines name prospective NATO customers, but notes that close allies of the USA in the Asia-Pacific could be future clients.

"Russian investigators have disclosed that the Utair Boeing 737-500 involved in a landing accident at Usinsk struck a snow bank with its main undercarriage just before touching down. The aircraft hit the bank, sustaining damage, about 15m before reaching runway 13 as it arrived following a service from Moscow Vnukovo on 9 February, according to federal air transport regulator Rosaviatsia. After the aircraft came to a halt on the runway, resting on its engines and fuselage underside with its heading 80° off the centreline, passengers evacuated through slides and the overwing exits. Inspectors found the right-hand main landing-gear assembly had been torn off the 737 and was located about 1,000m from the aircraft. Its left main gear had collapsed and folded under the wing. The collapse also damaged inboard flaps and other wing structures. The wind had been from 150° at 12kt but gusting to 21kt at the time of the arrival, about 12:25. None of the 94 passengers and six crew members suffered serious injuries. Meteorological data from the regulator states that the cloud base was at 450m (1,480ft) with visibility of 1,700m.

"Output from Airbus's Chinese narrowbody assembly line in Tianjin remains suspended amid the coronavirus outbreak, as the manufacturer evaluates the situation and potential impact on other production sites. Speaking at the Singapore air show, senior vice-president for marketing, Francois Caudron said Airbus “froze production in Tianjin” over the Chinese new year (25 January) period when it was already scheduled to be closed, and it has not re-opened since. “We are constantly assessing the situation,” says Airbus. Caudron emphasises that the suspension is driven by staffing rather than delivery deferrals from local airline customers. “It's not related to the fact that we don't need to produce aircraft, it's the fact that you cannot get the workers to come. And you observe that across the industry, it's not just aviation,” he says. Beyond the single-aisle final assembly line, Airbus also has an A330 completion centre in Tianjin and relies on Chinese suppliers for its global production system across its lines in Europe and the USA.

"Cash conservation will the priority of airline chiefs hit by the outbreak of novel coronavirus, although the longer term impact of the pandemic is harder to quantify, according to Andrew Herdman, the outgoing director general of the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines. This is not Herdman's first experience of a disease-induced crisis: during the SARS outbreak of 2003, which also afflicted carriers in the region, he was working for Cathay Pacific Airways. Herdman, speaking ahead of the Singapore air show, noted that profit margins are tight even when things are stable, but during the current outbreak airline chiefs will not be thinking about profits or even losses. “You worry about cash-flow and you worry about survival, you don't worry about your P&L, but your balance sheet, because you're going to have negative cash-flow. You have got to focus on that.” He points out that the region's airline industry is far bigger than it was in 2003, which will make the financial effect of coronavirus proportionally greater. Some Asian carriers, particularly those from China, will see a “massive” impact, he says. But Herdman believes the ad hoc responses of specific countries - including travel bans and other measures - cause more problems than they solve. “Some of these measures, whilst well-intentioned, seem to lack any proper public health justification, whilst causing significant and widespread disruption to travel and trade activities across the world,” he says. “Arbitrary restrictions and blanket travel bans are inconsistent with the international health regulations, and result in unnecessary inconvenience and added uncertainty amongst members of the public.” In addition, Herdman says that passengers must be screened at both ends of the journey: “One thing we learned from SARS, there were a lot of countries who imposed arrival screening,” he says. “And the analysis was that what you need is departure screening.

"One of Russian carrier Utair's Boeing 737-500s has been evacuated after it suffered a landing accident on a wintry runway in Russia's Komi republic. The aircraft (VQ-BPS) had been operating the UT595 service from Moscow Vnukovo to Usinsk airport on 9 February. Utair says that a “sharp, unpredictable windshear” occurred during the landing, and that the landing-gear collapsed while the aircraft was on the runway. “Owing to the prompt and highly professional actions of the crew, the aircraft was able to be kept on the runway until it stopped completely,” the airline says. It says the crew was “experienced”, with the captain having logged 6,900 hours on type and the first officer 3,600h. Ninety-four passengers were on board, one of whom sought medical attention for a minor injury. “Utair specialists have flown to Usinsk to analyse flight information and determine the causes of what happened,” the carrier says. Images on social media purporting to show the scene indicate the aircraft's main undercarriage sustained a collapse and the 737 came to rest on its engines on a heading perpendicular to the runway. Slides were deployed to evacuate passengers. The airport has a single runway designated 13/31. NOTAM data from the Russian aeronautical information publication, valid on 9 February, states that the ILS glidepath and the approach lighting for runway 13 are unserviceable. Meteorological data for Usinsk airport is unavailable but wintry conditions including snow were clearly present at the time of the accident, around 12:45. Russia's federal Investigative Committee says six crew members were also on board. ”Steps are being taken to establish the circumstances of the aviation incident, as well as the causes and conditions,” it says, adding that a routine criminal probe has been opened. The north-west regional transport prosecutor's office says Usinsk airport was subsequently closed with flights redirected to Ukhta.

"Flawed firefighting tactics and inadequate accident site surveillance contributed to the sole fatality after an Emirates Boeing 777-300 crashed on the runway at Dubai during a failed go-around. While two initial foam vehicles – known as Fire 6 and Fire 10 – arrived at the scene of the accident within 90s, they parked behind the trailing edge of the right wing. This wing was in contact with the ground owing to the retracted landing-gear and separation of the right engine, obscuring the view of the fuselage underside and a fire which had broken out in the right-hand landing-gear bay. Dense black smoke was being emitted from underneath the right wing root leading edge and “should have alerted” the fire commander to assess the fire's dynamics and the source of this smoke, says the General Civil Aviation Authority inquiry. No fire vehicles were positioned forward of the right wing and fire commander's own vehicle was parked in a location which limited his view of the site. Firefighters were, however, placed in close proximity to the wing root and “should have realised” the developing situation, the inquiry says, and relayed this information to the commander. Although personnel from Fire 6 were cooling the wing root with a sideline, this had no effect on the fire burning in the landing-gear bay which was continuously heating the right side of the centre fuel tank. Firefighters from Fire 10 started to move in closer, deploying a sideline to start tackling the landing-gear. Both Fire 6 and Fire 10 exhausted their water supplies about 20s before some 100kg of residual fuel in the centre tank ignited in a vapour explosion and tore a 15m panel from the upper inboard wing skin. The panel struck one of the sideline firefighters, fatally injuring him, and landed behind the wing. This explosion, which occurred 9min 40s after the aircraft came to rest, lifted the cabin floor over the tank and provided a path for fire and smoke to enter the passenger cabin, while fuel in the right wing's main tank was no longer contained behind a rib separating it from the centre tank. “As a result, the fire dynamics changed and the fire became more intense,” says the inquiry. The firefighting changed from being offensive to defensive, with greater attention paid to firefighter safety because there was no prospect of saving the aircraft. But the inquiry says large volumes of water were used in applying “unco-ordinated” tactics which “prolonged” the time to bring the fire under control. Dubai airport conducted an emergency exercise in June 2015, about 14 months before the 3 August 2016 accident, based on an Airbus A380 overrun scenario. “The exercise highlighted deficiencies in the communications system and the consequences of decisions taken based on poor information,” the inquiry says, adding that the deficiencies identified during the exercise – including poor training – were “accurate indicators” of real shortcomings observed during the 777 accident. “There were many similarities [during the exercises] that were repeated during the accident response,” it adds. No dynamic risk assessment of the 777 situation was carried out and sideline firefighters were moving close to fuel tanks despite the potential explosion hazard. Crew managers did not communicate details of the firefighting actions to the fire commander. Investigators found the airport's training system could not detect the lack of knowledge and understanding of incident command and firefighting tactics. “Exercises were limited to simple fire scenarios,” the inquiry says. “No appropriate simulated techniques were developed to challenge the fire commanders, sector commanders, crew managers, and firefighters to assess fire dynamics and develop appropriate tactics.”",2,702,1.0,0.3406,"test, force, helicopter, fire, system, service, attack, design, usaf, missile","['flaw', 'firefighting', 'tactic', 'inadequate', 'accident', 'site', 'surveillance', 'contribute', 'sole', 'fatality', 'emirate', 'crashed', 'runway', 'dubai', 'fail', 'goaround', 'initial', 'foam', 'vehicle', 'know', 'fire', 'fire', 'arrive', 'scene', 'accident', 'within', 'park', 'behind', 'trail', 'edge', 'right', 'wing', 'wing', 'contact', 'ground', 'owe', 'retract', 'landinggear', 'separation', 'right', 'engine', 'obscure', 'view', 'fuselage', 'underside', 'fire', 'broken', 'righthand', 'landinggear', 'bay', 'dense', 'black', 'smoke', 'emit', 'underneath', 'right', 'wing', 'root', 'lead', 'edge', 'alert', 'fire', 'commander', 'ass', 'fire', 'dynamic', 'source', 'smoke', 'say', 'general', 'civil', 'authority', 'inquiry', 'fire', 'vehicle', 'position', 'forward', 'right', 'wing', 'fire', 'commander', 'vehicle', 'park', 'location', 'limited', 'view', 'site', 'firefighter', 'however', 'place', 'close', 'proximity', 'wing', 'root', 'realise', 'develop', 'situation', 'inquiry', 'say', 'relayed', 'information', 'commander', 'although', 'personnel', 'fire', 'cool', 'wing', 'root', 'sideline', 'effect', 'fire', 'burning', 'landinggear', 'bay', 'continuously', 'heating', 'right', 'side', 'centre', 'fuel', 'tank', 'firefighter', 'fire', 'start', 'move', 'closer', 'deploy', 'sideline', 'start', 'tackle', 'landinggear', 'fire', 'fire', 'exhaust', 'water', 'supply', 'residual', 'fuel', 'centre', 'tank', 'ignite', 'vapour', 'explosion', 'tore', 'panel', 'upper', 'inboard', 'wing', 'skin', 'panel', 'struck', 'sideline', 'firefighter', 'fatally', 'injure', 'land', 'behind', 'wing', 'explosion', 'occur', 'come', 'rest', 'lift', 'cabin', 'floor', 'tank', 'provide', 'path', 'fire', 'smoke', 'enter', 'passenger', 'cabin', 'fuel', 'right', 'wing', 'main', 'tank', 'longer', 'contain', 'behind', 'rib', 'separate', 'centre', 'tank', 'result', 'fire', 'dynamic', 'change', 'fire', 'become', 'intense', 'say', 'inquiry', 'firefighting', 'change', 'offensive', 'defensive', 'great', 'attention', 'paid', 'firefighter', 'safety', 'prospect', 'save', 'inquiry', 'say', 'large', 'volume', 'water', 'use', 'apply', 'uncoordinated', 'tactic', 'prolong', 'bring', 'fire', 'control', 'dubai', 'airport', 'conduct', 'emergency', 'exercise', 'june', 'month', 'august', 'accident', 'base', 'overrun', 'scenario', 'exercise', 'highlight', 'deficiency', 'communication', 'system', 'consequence', 'decision', 'take', 'base', 'poor', 'information', 'inquiry', 'say', 'add', 'deficiency', 'identify', 'exercise', 'include', 'poor', 'training', 'accurate', 'indicator', 'real', 'shortcoming', 'observe', 'accident', 'many', 'similarity', 'exercise', 'repeat', 'accident', 'response', 'add', 'dynamic', 'risk', 'assessment', 'situation', 'carry', 'sideline', 'firefighter', 'move', 'close', 'fuel', 'tank', 'despite', 'potential', 'explosion', 'hazard', 'crew', 'manager', 'communicate', 'detail', 'firefighting', 'action', 'fire', 'commander', 'investigator', 'found', 'airport', 'training', 'system', 'detect', 'lack', 'knowledge', 'understand', 'incident', 'command', 'firefighting', 'tactic', 'exercise', 'limited', 'simple', 'fire', 'scenario', 'inquiry', 'say', 'appropriate', 'simulated', 'technique', 'developed', 'challenge', 'fire', 'commander', 'sector', 'commander', 'crew', 'manager', 'firefighter', 'ass', 'fire', 'dynamic', 'develop', 'appropriate', 'tactic']"

"Investigation of the Emirates Boeing 777-300 go-around accident in Dubai is likely to draw further attention to the issue of pilots' awareness and understanding of aircraft system design logic. The crew attempted to abort the landing and activated the go-around switches, without realising that the aircraft had briefly touched down on the runway – a situation which inhibits the go-around switches and requires manual advancement of the thrust levers. Boeing says this logic is designed to prevent pilots from inadvertently activating go-around mode after touchdown, which risks a runway excursion. But the crew's “reliance on automation” and lack of training in flying go-arounds from points close to the runway – with the switches inhibited – meant they did not recognise that the thrust remained at idle as the go-around was initiated, says the United Arab Emirates General Civil Aviation Authority. The pilots omitted a crucial check to verify engine thrust. The inquiry says Emirates' training programme for the 777 was based on Boeing's and the US FAA's approved training scheme which “did not include” the inhibition logic, says the inquiry. It says the flight crew operating manual mentioned the inhibition as a “statement of information, without any associated procedure” while the flight crew training manual contained a note that an automatic go-around “cannot be initiated after touchdown” without a clarification for this statement. While both the captain and first officer had attended initial computer-based training for the 777, this did not cover go-around switch inhibiting. “Neither [pilot] had a complete understanding of the [go-around] switches and they were not made aware during their training that [these] switches become inhibited [close to touchdown],” the inquiry says. After completing his 777 conversion course the captain conducted 127 monitored landings in the simulator and during line operations, and 54 go-around manoeuvres in the simulator. All normal missed approaches were carried out at heights above 50ft, and based on activating the go-around switches. During upgrade training for captaincy he practiced rejected landings from below 50ft but before touchdown. While the Emirates training programme included a particular manual-handling session specific to go-arounds after touchdown, the inquiry says the scenarios differed from the circumstances of the accident because the training was performed with the autopilot, autothrottle and flight directors disengaged. “[The captain] stated that he had never practised normal go-arounds after touchdown with the autothrottle armed and active,” it says. This is crucial because Emirates' policy, in line with Boeing's recommendations, is for pilots to use autothrottle for all phases of flight including normal go-around. But the inhibit logic characteristics for the go-around switches, says the inquiry, were “not clearly demonstrated” to pilots when the autothrottle was engaged and controlling the thrust. “Neither [Boeing] nor [Emirates] thoroughly addressed training and procedures dealing with times when the [go-around] switches become inhibited,” it states. Emirates has modified its training since the August 2016 accident, the inquiry points out, to reinforce training for go-around after touchdown and include information relating to the switch-inhibit logic in various training modules. The airline has also been liaising with Boeing to develop “engineered defences” to alert the crew when a go-around switch is pushed during an inhibited phase, it adds. Investigators have recommended that the FAA carries out a safety study, in consultation with Boeing, to enhance the 777's autothrottle system and go-around switch inhibit logic to “avoid pilot errors due to over-reliance on automation”. The inquiry also says flight crew manuals should have the significance of the inhibit logic “appropriately” highlighted.",2,704,7.0,0.5346,"crew, runway, inquiry, land, approach, accident, investigator, captain, incident, pilot","['investigation', 'emirate', 'goaround', 'accident', 'dubai', 'likely', 'draw', 'far', 'attention', 'issue', 'pilot', 'awareness', 'understand', 'system', 'design', 'logic', 'crew', 'attempt', 'abort', 'land', 'activate', 'goaround', 'switch', 'without', 'realise', 'briefly', 'touch', 'runway', 'situation', 'inhibits', 'goaround', 'switch', 'require', 'manual', 'advancement', 'thrust', 'lever', 'say', 'logic', 'design', 'prevent', 'pilot', 'inadvertently', 'activate', 'goaround', 'mode', 'touchdown', 'risk', 'runway', 'excursion', 'crew', 'reliance', 'automation', 'lack', 'training', 'fly', 'goarounds', 'point', 'close', 'runway', 'switch', 'inhibit', 'meant', 'recognise', 'thrust', 'remain', 'idle', 'goaround', 'initiate', 'say', 'united', 'arab', 'emirate', 'general', 'civil', 'authority', 'pilot', 'omit', 'crucial', 'check', 'verify', 'engine', 'thrust', 'inquiry', 'say', 'emirate', 'training', 'programme', 'base', 'u', 'faa', 'approve', 'training', 'scheme', 'include', 'inhibition', 'logic', 'say', 'inquiry', 'say', 'crew', 'operating', 'manual', 'mention', 'inhibition', 'statement', 'information', 'without', 'associate', 'procedure', 'crew', 'training', 'manual', 'contain', 'note', 'automatic', 'goaround', 'initiate', 'touchdown', 'without', 'clarification', 'statement', 'captain', 'officer', 'attend', 'initial', 'computerbased', 'training', 'cover', 'goaround', 'switch', 'inhibit', 'neither', 'pilot', 'complete', 'understand', 'goaround', 'switch', 'make', 'aware', 'training', 'switch', 'become', 'inhibit', 'close', 'touchdown', 'inquiry', 'say', 'complete', 'conversion', 'course', 'captain', 'conduct', 'monitor', 'landing', 'simulator', 'line', 'operation', 'goaround', 'manoeuvre', 'simulator', 'normal', 'miss', 'approach', 'carry', 'height', 'base', 'activate', 'goaround', 'switch', 'upgrade', 'training', 'captaincy', 'practice', 'reject', 'landing', 'touchdown', 'emirate', 'training', 'programme', 'include', 'particular', 'manualhandling', 'session', 'specific', 'goarounds', 'touchdown', 'inquiry', 'say', 'scenario', 'differ', 'circumstance', 'accident', 'training', 'perform', 'autopilot', 'autothrottle', 'director', 'disengage', 'captain', 'state', 'never', 'practise', 'normal', 'goarounds', 'touchdown', 'autothrottle', 'arm', 'active', 'say', 'crucial', 'emirate', 'policy', 'line', 'recommendation', 'pilot', 'use', 'autothrottle', 'phase', 'include', 'normal', 'goaround', 'inhibit', 'logic', 'characteristic', 'goaround', 'switch', 'say', 'inquiry', 'clearly', 'demonstrate', 'pilot', 'autothrottle', 'engage', 'control', 'thrust', 'neither', 'emirate', 'thoroughly', 'address', 'training', 'procedure', 'deal', 'goaround', 'switch', 'become', 'inhibit', 'state', 'emirate', 'modify', 'training', 'since', 'august', 'accident', 'inquiry', 'point', 'reinforce', 'training', 'goaround', 'touchdown', 'include', 'information', 'relate', 'switchinhibit', 'logic', 'various', 'training', 'module', 'liaise', 'develop', 'engineer', 'defence', 'alert', 'crew', 'goaround', 'switch', 'push', 'inhibit', 'phase', 'add', 'investigator', 'recommend', 'faa', 'carry', 'safety', 'study', 'consultation', 'enhance', 'autothrottle', 'system', 'goaround', 'switch', 'inhibit', 'logic', 'avoid', 'pilot', 'error', 'due', 'overreliance', 'automation', 'inquiry', 'say', 'crew', 'manual', 'significance', 'inhibit', 'logic', 'appropriately', 'highlight']"
"Icelandair intends to decide over “the next few months” whether to introduce Airbus types to its all-Boeing fleet. In May 2019 – following the Boeing 737 Max's grounding two months earlier – the Icelandic flag carrier disclosed that it was evaluating Airbus A321neos as replacements for 757s, and that a switch to an all-Airbus fleet was also a possibility. While the continued uncertainty surrounding the 737 Max's return to service has “delayed” that fleet review, “conclusions are expected in the next few months”, says Icelandair. Scenarios under consideration as part of the long-term fleet strategy review include sticking with an existing plan to replace 757s with 737 Max jets; introducing Airbuses alongside the 737 Max; or switching to a fleet entirely supplied by the European manufacturer. Cirium fleets data shows that Icelandair has five 737 Max 8s and a Max 9 in storage, and has orders for another 10 Max jets. It in-service passenger fleet includes 23 757-200s, two 757-300s and four 767-300s. The carrier says it is “still anticipating” the delivery of the 10 on-order Max jets, and predicts that three of the aircraft will be delivered later this year. Under a previous schedule, three aircraft were due to be delivered in 2019, five this year, and two in 2021. Icelandair warns, however, that “the risk of further delays is increasing”. The 737 Max grounding “already had significant adverse effect on the company's operations and profitability and will continue to do so while the suspension remains in place”, it notes. It is monitoring the situation and maintains “rolling 12-18 month contingency plans to ensure that all mitigating actions are taken”.

"Icelandair Group estimates that the Boeing 737 Max grounding has had a net negative effect of $100 million on the company's EBIT to date. Describing 2019 as a “challenging year”, chief executive Bogi Nils Bogason states that the grounding of the 737 Max since March had “an unprecedented negative impact on Icelandair's operations, resulting in lost revenue, increased expenses and restricted utilisation of the company's fleet and crew”. Management's key focus has been on “minimising the impact” on the business, the airline says. Prior to the grounding, Icelandair had planned for its 737 Max jets to provide 27% of passenger capacity in 2019. Cirium fleet data shows that Icelandair has five 737 Max 8s and one Max 9 in storage, and orders for another 10 aircraft. Instead of having a planned fleet of 36 aircraft – including nine 737 Max jets – at its disposal, the airline operated 33 aircraft during last year's peak holiday season. This included 22 757-200s – three more than previously planned – two 757-300s, four 767-300s, and five wet-leased aircraft. The number of wet-leased aircraft varied between three in May, five from June through August, and four in September. In addition to leasing costs, the airline faced increased expenditure due higher fuel consumption and higher ground, navigation and maintenance costs for operating older aircraft. Icelandair says it reached two agreements with Boeing for “partial” compensation of the airline's losses in connection with the Max grounding. The airline is in ongoing discussions regarding further compensation, it says. Icelandair asserts the Max grounding was the main reason for its “negative results” in 2019. The group reduced its EBIT loss to $39.3 million in 2019, from just under $57 million in the previous year. But the group's net loss grew $2.2 million to $57.8 million. Revenue declined by $6 million to $1.5 billion as Icelandair adjusted its network to concentrate on more profitable routes. Icelandair says that the number of passengers it carried to its home country grew 25% in the year, but the number of transatlantic transit passengers declined 9%. Overall, the airline's passenger numbers grew 6% to 4.4 million. Capacity as measured in ASK increased by 3%. For 2020, the carrier predicts a passenger decline to around 4.2 million travellers. “The current assumption is that the number of flights will be reduced by about 3% and [ASK] by 8%,” Icelandair says. It notes: “The key focus in 2020 will be on the profitability of Icelandair's route network and on mitigating the operating risk of a potential further suspension of the Max aircraft”. In January, Icelandair said that it does not expect the aircraft to be available for this year's peak holiday season and has therefore arranged leases for three 737-800s and the use of two additional 757s during the period.

"Investigators have disclosed that an in-flight upset involving an Avianca Airbus A319 resulted in a 2,500ft loss of altitude. The aircraft had been operating a San Jose-Bogota flight and was cruising at 37,000ft, with the captain as the flying pilot, when the incident occurred. French investigation authority BEA, citing Costa Rican counterparts, says the twinjet experienced “changes in the attitude, speed and vertical acceleration”. It lost 2,500ft and suffered an overspeed relating to the maximum operating Mach number, as well as a hydraulic system alert. The aircraft had been flying in the vicinity of the Panama-Colombia border when the upset occurred, and it diverted to Panama City. Avianca had previously indicated that the diversion followed an alert from aircraft systems, and that four of the 113 occupants – including crew members – were hospitalised after the 23 January event.",2,707,7.0,0.2554,"crew, runway, inquiry, land, approach, accident, investigator, captain, incident, pilot","['investigator', 'disclose', 'inflight', 'upset', 'involve', 'avianca', 'result', 'loss', 'altitude', 'operating', 'san', 'josebogota', 'cruise', 'captain', 'fly', 'pilot', 'incident', 'occur', 'french', 'investigation', 'authority', 'bea', 'cite', 'costa', 'rican', 'counterpart', 'say', 'twinjet', 'experienced', 'change', 'attitude', 'speed', 'vertical', 'acceleration', 'lose', 'suffer', 'overspeed', 'relate', 'maximum', 'operating', 'mach', 'number', 'well', 'hydraulic', 'system', 'alert', 'fly', 'vicinity', 'panamacolombia', 'border', 'upset', 'occur', 'divert', 'panama', 'city', 'avianca', 'previously', 'indicate', 'diversion', 'follow', 'alert', 'system', 'occupant', 'include', 'crew', 'member', 'hospitalise', 'january', 'event']"
"Investigators have disclosed that an Emirates Boeing 777-300 captain perceived the aircraft had encountered a thermal updraught, and would not be able to land in the touchdown zone at Dubai, before an ill-fated go-around attempt resulted in the jet's crashing on the runway. While it had already explained why the go-around failed, the United Arab Emirates' General Civil Aviation Authority has given a detailed insight into the decision-making which resulted in the 777's crew's opting to abort the 3 August 2016 landing. It states that the aircraft had been conducting a stable approach to runway 12L in a tailwind but that, during an early flare at 40ft, the captain believed a thermal updraught from the hot ground was obstructing the descent. “We had thermal updraught coming from the ground because of the heat, so it was pushing the aircraft up, so it caused a long flare,” the captain told the inquiry. “[The aircraft] was going towards the end of the touchdown zone, so after that we decided to go around.” Investigators reveal that the captain remarked, “Thermals”, as the aircraft reached a point 840m past the threshold, beyond the touchdown zone which is located between 305m and 610m. But while both pilots perceived thermal effects, the inquiry points out that neither had noticed a shift in wind direction about 650m from the threshold. The tailwind had diminished and transitioned to a headwind just before touchdown, increasing the aircraft's airspeed. Twelve minutes prior to the 777's arrival, the inquiry says, a Boeing 737 crew had reported light-to-medium windshear on 12L short final. While an aircraft immediately following the 737, an Airbus A321, was informed by tower controllers about the windshear report, the four subsequent arrivals – all Emirates 777s – were not. The inquiry points out that the A321 and the 777 behind it both executed go-arounds. Two 777s then made uneventful landings before the arrival of the 777 involved in the accident. Emirates' policy required pilots to consider a go-around if a landing could not be achieved within the touchdown zone. As a result, says the inquiry, the 777 captain's go-around decision was “in line” with the carrier's policy. But it adds that the decision was based on the perception that the aircraft would not land due to thermals, and not as a result of a windshear encounter. “For this reason, the [captain] elected to fly a normal go-around and not to fly the windshear escape manoeuvre,” it states. Although the aircraft was equipped with a long-landing warning system, the captain's declaration of the go-around immediately preceded the automated long-landing annunciation. The inquiry notes that the long-landing alert occurred 1,280m beyond the threshold – some 92m further along the runway than its programmed alert distance. The accident sequence in the aftermath of the go-around decision had been previously established by investigators. Owing to the aircraft's having briefly touched down for 6s, the go-around switches were inhibited when the crew attempted to command go-around thrust. The inquiry says the crew had not been fully trained in the inhibition logic and did not check the thrust situation during the go-around attempt, failing to realise that the aircraft had become airborne with only idle thrust – which was insufficient to maintain flight. As a result the aircraft, its landing-gear in the process of retracting, reached just 85ft in height at 131kt before descending and striking the runway, sliding to a halt before being consumed by fire. All of the occupants survived, although a firefighter attending the scene suffered fatal injuries during an explosion.",2,708,7.0,0.6624,"crew, runway, inquiry, land, approach, accident, investigator, captain, incident, pilot","['investigator', 'disclose', 'emirate', 'captain', 'perceive', 'encounter', 'thermal', 'updraught', 'able', 'land', 'touchdown', 'zone', 'dubai', 'illfated', 'goaround', 'attempt', 'result', 'jet', 'crash', 'runway', 'already', 'explain', 'goaround', 'fail', 'united', 'arab', 'emirate', 'general', 'civil', 'authority', 'give', 'detailed', 'insight', 'decisionmaking', 'result', 'crew', 'opt', 'abort', 'august', 'land', 'state', 'conduct', 'stable', 'approach', 'runway', 'tailwind', 'early', 'flare', 'captain', 'believe', 'thermal', 'updraught', 'hot', 'ground', 'obstruct', 'descent', 'thermal', 'updraught', 'come', 'ground', 'heat', 'push', 'cause', 'long', 'flare', 'captain', 'told', 'inquiry', 'go', 'towards', 'end', 'touchdown', 'zone', 'decide', 'go', 'investigator', 'reveal', 'captain', 'remark', 'thermal', 'reach', 'point', 'past', 'threshold', 'beyond', 'touchdown', 'zone', 'locate', 'pilot', 'perceive', 'thermal', 'effect', 'inquiry', 'point', 'neither', 'notice', 'shift', 'wind', 'direction', 'threshold', 'tailwind', 'diminish', 'transition', 'headwind', 'touchdown', 'increase', 'airspeed', 'twelve', 'minute', 'prior', 'arrival', 'inquiry', 'say', 'crew', 'report', 'lighttomedium', 'windshear', 'short', 'final', 'immediately', 'follow', 'inform', 'tower', 'controller', 'windshear', 'report', 'subsequent', 'arrival', 'emirate', 'inquiry', 'point', 'behind', 'execute', 'goarounds', 'make', 'uneventful', 'landing', 'arrival', 'involve', 'accident', 'emirate', 'policy', 'require', 'pilot', 'consider', 'goaround', 'land', 'achieve', 'within', 'touchdown', 'zone', 'result', 'say', 'inquiry', 'captain', 'goaround', 'decision', 'line', 'carrier', 'policy', 'add', 'decision', 'base', 'perception', 'land', 'due', 'thermal', 'result', 'windshear', 'encounter', 'reason', 'captain', 'elect', 'fly', 'normal', 'goaround', 'fly', 'windshear', 'escape', 'manoeuvre', 'state', 'although', 'equip', 'longlanding', 'warn', 'system', 'captain', 'declaration', 'goaround', 'immediately', 'precede', 'automate', 'longlanding', 'annunciation', 'inquiry', 'note', 'longlanding', 'alert', 'occur', 'beyond', 'threshold', 'far', 'along', 'runway', 'programmed', 'alert', 'distance', 'accident', 'sequence', 'aftermath', 'goaround', 'decision', 'previously', 'establish', 'investigator', 'owe', 'briefly', 'touch', 'goaround', 'switch', 'inhibit', 'crew', 'attempt', 'command', 'goaround', 'thrust', 'inquiry', 'say', 'crew', 'fully', 'train', 'inhibition', 'logic', 'check', 'thrust', 'situation', 'goaround', 'attempt', 'fail', 'realise', 'become', 'airborne', 'idle', 'thrust', 'insufficient', 'maintain', 'result', 'landinggear', 'process', 'retract', 'reach', 'height', 'descend', 'strike', 'runway', 'slide', 'halt', 'consume', 'fire', 'occupant', 'survive', 'although', 'firefighter', 'attend', 'scene', 'suffer', 'fatal', 'injury', 'explosion']"
"Malaysia's prime minister Mahathir Mohamad has weighed in on bribery allegations around AirAsia Group's aircraft orders from Airbus. “Usually when the [Malaysian] government buys equipment, we would often ask [the manufacturer] for an offset. Meaning, if we were to buy an aircraft, we would ask for an offset,” Mahathir told reporters at a press event held on 6 February. “If we're able to acquire something because we buy them at a high price, why can't we accept [the offset]? If the money goes into our pocket, that is corruption. But if the money is used for other purposes, it is [considered] offset.” Court documents released from a UK Serious Fraud Office (SFO) probe into Airbus detailed allegations that two AirAsia executives – both “key decision makers” at AirAsia and long-haul operation AirAsia X– were “rewarded” through a sports sponsorship, in respect of an order for 180 aircraft. While AirAsia has vehemently denied any wrongdoing, founders Tony Fernandes and Kamarudin Meranun have volunteered to step aside as group chief executive and group chairman, respectively, for two months to facilitate an independent probe. Back in 2003, Fernandes successfully lobbied for Mahathir to propose open skies agreements with neighbouring Indonesia, Singapore and Thailand, a move that was instrumental to AirAsia's success. Mahathir was prime minister from 1981 to 2003, before beginning his current term in May 2018. In recent years, local media reports suggest that AirAsia is one of the carriers involved in proposals to turn around ailing national carrier, Malaysia Airlines. This may have roots in a failed share swap between both carrier groups that was scrapped in 2012. In a September 2019 interview with The Edge Malaysia, Fernandes expressed his lack of interest in acquiring Malaysia Airlines.",2,709,10.0,0.4351,"international, authority, civil, state, investigation, case, add, january, airasia, crash","['malaysia', 'prime', 'minister', 'mahathir', 'mohamad', 'weigh', 'bribery', 'allegation', 'around', 'airasia', 'order', 'usually', 'malaysian', 'government', 'buy', 'equipment', 'often', 'ask', 'manufacturer', 'offset', 'meaning', 'buy', 'ask', 'offset', 'mahathir', 'told', 'reporter', 'press', 'event', 'held', 'february', 'able', 'acquire', 'something', 'buy', 'high', 'price', 'ca', 'accept', 'offset', 'money', 'go', 'pocket', 'corruption', 'money', 'use', 'purpose', 'consider', 'court', 'document', 'release', 'uk', 'serious', 'fraud', 'office', 'sfo', 'probe', 'detailed', 'allegation', 'airasia', 'executive', 'key', 'decision', 'maker', 'airasia', 'longhaul', 'operation', 'airasia', 'reward', 'sport', 'sponsorship', 'respect', 'order', 'airasia', 'vehemently', 'deny', 'wrongdoing', 'founder', 'tony', 'fernandes', 'kamarudin', 'meranun', 'volunteer', 'step', 'aside', 'chief', 'executive', 'chairman', 'respectively', 'month', 'facilitate', 'independent', 'probe', 'back', 'fernandes', 'successfully', 'lobby', 'mahathir', 'propose', 'open', 'sky', 'agreement', 'neighbour', 'indonesia', 'singapore', 'thailand', 'move', 'instrumental', 'airasia', 'success', 'mahathir', 'prime', 'minister', 'begin', 'current', 'term', 'may', 'recent', 'local', 'medium', 'report', 'suggest', 'airasia', 'carrier', 'involve', 'proposal', 'turn', 'around', 'ail', 'national', 'carrier', 'malaysia', 'may', 'root', 'fail', 'share', 'swap', 'carrier', 'scrap', 'september', 'interview', 'edge', 'malaysia', 'fernandes', 'express', 'lack', 'interest', 'acquire', 'malaysia']"
"Korean Air's full-year operating profit declined by 56.4% due to a sharp decline in cargo revenues, against a weak economic backdrop. Operating revenues were down by 2.8% to W12.3 trillion ($10.4 billion), dragged lower by a 15% decline in cargo revenues. This was partially offset by a marginal increase in passenger revenues, which accounts for over 60% of operating revenues. Operating expenses were largely steady at W12 trillion, as lower fuel costs were offset by higher labour costs and an increase in airport fees. This sent operating profit tumbling from W667 billion in 2018 to W291 billion in the year recently ended. Against a 1.2% increase in ASKs, the carrier's RPKs were up by 3.8%, pushing load factor up by 2 percentage points to 82.4%. Yield, however, declined by 3.3% to W93. The carrier attributes increased passenger traffic as a preemptive response to negative market trends. It sees a sustained increase in trans-pacific demand from its joint venture with Delta, from which it expects to grow transit demand and increase domestic connections, while expanding mainstream corporate sales in the United States. Meanwhile, growth markets such as Southeast Asia have offset declines in its Japan and Hong Kong networks. The carrier plans to increase the frequency on services to Los Angeles, Boston, Singapore, and Delhi, alongside its recently announced expansion into Budapest. In the cargo segment, FTKs were down 9.8% against a 3.3% decline in unit capacity. As a result, load factor shed 5 percentage points to 71.4%, while yield was 5.9% lower to W342. The carrier attributed weakness in the segment to prolonged US-China trade tensions and a global slowdown in trade. It seeks opportunity in growth markets such as Eastern Europe, China, and South America, as well as new and high-margin sectors. For both passenger and cargo segments, Korean is looking at optimising either flight patterns or capacity, with the use of charters to capture demand. As at 31 December 2019, the carrier's current assets stood at W3.26 trillion, down 8.7% from last year. It has 146 passenger aircraft in its fleet – 105 widebodies and 41 narrowbodies – having added two Boeing 777 and one Airbus A220, while phasing out one 737, between January and December 2019.

"Global airline passenger demand grew 4.2% in 2019, newly released data from IATA shows, but this was below a long-term growth rate of around 5.5%. It was the weakest reading for revenue passenger-kilometre growth since 2009, and a decline from 7.3% in 2018. Nonetheless, it significantly outpaced the rise in global GDP. “Airlines did well to maintain steady growth last year in the face of a number of challenges,” states IATA director general Alexandre de Juniac. “A softer economic backdrop, weak global trade activity, and political and geopolitical tensions took their toll on demand.” He adds: “Astute capacity management, and the effects of the 737 Max grounding, contributed to another record load factor, helping the industry to manage through weaker demand and improving environmental performance.” Capacity was increased 3.4% last year, while load factor rose 0.7% to a record high of 82.6%.

"Boeing's 777X flight-test programme finally got underway when the first aircraft roared off Paine Field's runway on 25 January. The flight marked a notable spot of positive news for Boeing, which has been mired for months in the 737 Max issues. Now the 777X flight-test programme is moving forward and counting down to first deliveries, which Boeing says will occur next year. The first flight-test 777-9, designated WH001, has flown four times as of 6 January and is based at Boeing Field in Seattle, Boeing says. Over the next year, that aircraft's job will include testing avionics and related system, brakes, flutter, icing, stability, control and low-speed aerodynamics, Boeing says. Three more 777-9s, all of them currently on Boeing's Everett flight line, will join the test fleet and be flying by the second quarter, Boeing says. The second aircraft, WH002, will test auto-land, ground effects, stability and control, while WH003 will test the auxiliary power unit, avionics, flight loads and propulsion performance. WH004 will test the environmental control system, extended twin-engine operations, noise and general functionality and reliability, Boeing says. The Chicago-based airframer declines to provide specific details about its certification timeline, but industry experts expect flight testing will take about one year – a fairly standard duration that would put certification in January 2021. “We're taking the lessons learned from the 737 Max and applying them to the 777X to ensure we are as prepared as possible for 777X certification,” Boeing says. “Given the unknowns around development programmes, as well as the certification process, we do not want to be overly specific about hours of testing or timing.” Experts doubt the 737 Max crisis will significantly impact 777X certification, though they say it will likely spur closer review of safety analyses and pilot response assumptions – concerns raised by the two deadly Max crashes. “I really anticipate a fairly smooth ride. A very diligent and methodical and smooth ride,” Michel Merluzeau, an aerospace analyst with consultancy AIR, says of 777X certification. “The real area of focus will be the engines and flight control system”. The Max crisis stemmed from Boeing's decision to counteract the narrowbody's nose-up pitch tendency with a system that pushes the nose down. Assumptions about how pilots would respond to erroneous activation of that system also played a role, investigations concluded. But the 777X does not have an MCAS-like system, Boeing confirms. And, regardless, its advanced fly-by-wire system could address any unexpected pitch, says Peter Lemme, an aerospace consultant and former Boeing engineer who worked on several of the manufacturer's commercial aircraft flight-test programmes. Boeing says it intends to certify the 777X as a 777 variant, not an entirely new aircraft. That could enable the 777X to take “credit” for some validation work performed by the first-generation 777, though the extent of the 777X's updates likely mean such credit would be limited, says Lemme, who himself participated in flight tests for several Boeing commercial aircraft. Boeing stretched the 777X's fuselage and equipped it with a new and larger composite wing. The 777-9's fuselage measures 76.7m (252ft), almost 3m longer than the 777-300ER's fuselage, which enables the 777-9 to carry about 30 more passengers. The 777X has a 71.8m wingspan – 7m longer than the span of the 777's metallic wings. Due to concern about airport constraints, Boeing equipped the 777X's wings with folding tips, each 3.4m long, which retract upon landing. The 777X also has new-generation engines – GE Aviation GE9X powerplants, which can throw off 105,000lb-thrust (467kN). Issues with the GE9X's stator vanes delayed the first 777X flight several months, though GE insists it fixed the problem. Flight-test programmes typically involve a few thousand hours of flight time, with a handful of test aircraft flying several times weekly, says Lemme. For example, the Airbus A350-900 flight-test campaign lasted 15 months and used five aircraft flying some 2,600h. Lemme calls flight testing “opportunistic” due to unpredictable weather, and notes unforeseen issues like bird strikes or inaccurate aircraft performance assumptions can cause delays. The first few weeks typically involve simply proving the aircraft flies as engineers anticipated, Lemme says. The team is “hyper-focused on demonstrating...that the airplane is a good airplane”. Flight-test programmes then typically move to validating engineering models and assumptions related to aerodynamics, engine performance and fuel flow. Next may come more-advanced tests involving system and engine failures, as well as performance at hot and cold temperatures and with crosswinds, tailwinds and headwinds, Lemme says. Flight-test aircraft might carry as many as 15 or 20 people during flights, including two pilots, a test director who instructs the pilots, flight engineers and mechanics who monitor data, instrumentation engineers who monitor computers and sensors, and flight-test engineers who work with the pilots, Lemme says. Testing will involve what Lemme calls “abuse” tests such as full-brake rejected takeoff tests and tail-strike-inducing “velocity minimum unstick” tests, which determine the minimum speed at which the aircraft will fly. Boeing says the 777X, thanks to its additional passenger capacity and new wing and engines, drives down unit costs. It says the aircraft will cost 10% less to operate than previous-generation aircraft like the 777 and A350-1000. “We believe the 777X will be very successful in the market and continue to extend the 777's operational and sales success,” the company says. The 777-9 will have 7,285nm (13,500km) range and carry up to 426 passengers in two classes, while the 777-8, development of which remains on hold, will have 8,730nm range and carry up to 384 passengers, Boeing says. Sales have been modest. Boeing holds 309 firm orders from carriers such as All Nippon Airways, British Airways, Cathay Pacific, Lufthansa, Emirates Airline, Etihad Airways, Qatar Airways and Singapore Airlines, its figures show. But Boeing predicts, and analysts agree, that orders will uptick in the coming years as airlines retire existing widebodies. Boeing, of course, pitches the 777X as a replacement for 777s, of which 1,458 remain in service, according to Cirium fleets data. But it also views the 777X as a replacement for 747s, A340s and A380s, of which a combined roughly 880 remain flying, Cirium shows. Boeing says the “replacement demand cycle” is “just beginning”. Airlines could retire 60-100 older widebodies annually starting within a few years and lasting to the end of the decade, the company says. “The 777X is uniquely positioned to capture the replacement demand and help airlines grow as it is the largest and most-efficient twin-engine airplane in the world, unmatched in every aspect of performance,” Boeing says. But, unlike in the past, the 777 no longer has its market segment cornered. Airlines can now choose from several ultra-long-haul widebody options, including the 777X, A350 and, to some degree, 787-10, analysts note. “The 777X is facing a fragmented market,” Merluzeau says. He suggests the 777X might grab around 45% of the ultimate market share, with the A350 and 787-10 taking the rest. He suspects Boeing will produce 800 or 900 units in the next roughly 20 years. “It's going to have a nice, very strong niche, and will do very well,” Merluzeau says.",2,712,6.0,0.1824,"engine,

"Boeing has uncovered a new problem with the 737 Max aircraft's flight control computers, though the company does not anticipate the issue will upend its expectation to receive Max certification in the middle of 2020. “During flight testing of the 737 Max's updated software, an indicator light associated with the stabiliser trim system illuminated in the flight deck,” Boeing says on 6 February. “We determined that the illumination of this light was caused by differences in input data between the flight control computers.” More specifically, the indicator light relates to a June 2019 software update that causes the Max's two flight control computers to monitor each other – a feature Boeing calls “cross-compare redundancy”. Boeing has stored an estimated 400-plus 737 Max, including these aircraft parked at Boeing Field in Seattle, since the grounding took effect in March. It finally halted production in January. The company provides few other details about that software update. But, in December 2019, a member of a Max review panel described the new monitoring system to lawmakers. The monitors “cross-check pitch trim commands against each other” and cause the aircraft's automatic trim system to be disabled upon detecting differences, said Matt Kiefer, a member of the FAA-convened Technical Advisory Board (TAB). Boeing is now working on a software update that will ensure the indicator lights illuminates only “as intended”, it says. “Our current schedule assessment indicates that this change will not impact the present mid-2020 estimate for return to service.” Boeing notified the FAA of the latest issue during the week of 20 January. The FAA declines to say how the new software problem might affect certification. The agency has no “set timeframe” for certification, and approval will come only after the FAA's safety experts “are fully satisfied that all safety-related issues are addressed to the FAA's satisfaction”, the agency says. In addition to reviewing the Max's flight control systems – which contributed to two deadly crashes – regulators are looking closely at wire bundles on the Max due to concern about potential short circuits, according to reports. Boeing calls speculation about the potential impact of the wiring concerns “premature”. “We continue to perform the appropriate analysis including lab testing, fleet data assessment and third-party reviews”, the company says. “We are giving the technical team the time and resources they need to complete this analysis.” “Our highest priority is ensuring the 737 Max meets all safety and regulatory requirements before it returns to service,” Boeing adds.",2,713,11.0,0.4007,"pilot, faa, issue, safety, include, report, require, training, ground, order","['uncovered', 'problem', 'control', 'computer', 'though', 'anticipate', 'issue', 'upend', 'expectation', 'receive', 'certification', 'middle', 'test', 'update', 'software', 'indicator', 'light', 'associate', 'stabiliser', 'trim', 'system', 'illuminate', 'deck', 'say', 'february', 'determine', 'illumination', 'light', 'cause', 'difference', 'input', 'data', 'control', 'specifically', 'indicator', 'light', 'relates', 'june', 'software', 'update', 'cause', 'control', 'computer', 'monitor', 'feature', 'call', 'crosscompare', 'redundancy', 'store', 'estimate', 'include', 'park', 'field', 'seattle', 'since', 'ground', 'take', 'effect', 'march', 'finally', 'halt', 'production', 'january', 'provide', 'detail', 'software', 'update', 'december', 'member', 'review', 'panel', 'described', 'monitoring', 'system', 'lawmaker', 'monitor', 'crosscheck', 'pitch', 'trim', 'command', 'cause', 'automatic', 'trim', 'system', 'disabled', 'upon', 'detect', 'difference', 'say', 'matt', 'kiefer', 'member', 'faaconvened', 'technical', 'advisory', 'board', 'tab', 'work', 'software', 'update', 'ensure', 'indicator', 'light', 'illuminates', 'intend', 'say', 'current', 'schedule', 'assessment', 'indicates', 'change', 'impact', 'present', 'estimate', 'return', 'notify', 'faa', 'late', 'issue', 'week', 'january', 'faa', 'decline', 'say', 'software', 'problem', 'might', 'affect', 'certification', 'agency', 'set', 'timeframe', 'certification', 'approval', 'come', 'faa', 'safety', 'expert', 'fully', 'satisfied', 'safetyrelated', 'issue', 'address', 'faa', 'satisfaction', 'agency', 'say', 'addition', 'review', 'control', 'system', 'contribute', 'deadly', 'crash', 'regulator', 'look', 'closely', 'wire', 'bundle', 'due', 'concern', 'potential', 'short', 'circuit', 'accord', 'report', 'call', 'speculation', 'potential', 'impact', 'wiring', 'concern', 'premature', 'continue', 'perform', 'appropriate', 'analysis', 'include', 'lab', 'test', 'fleet', 'data', 'assessment', 'thirdparty', 'review', 'say', 'give', 'technical', 'team', 'resource', 'need', 'complete', 'high', 'priority', 'ensure', 'meet', 'safety', 'regulatory', 'requirement', 'return', 'service', 'add']"
"South African operator SA Express has been ordered to enter into business rescue, two months after a similar decision was made for flag-carrier South African Airways. SA Express operates a route network in southern Africa using a fleet of Bombardier CRJs and Q400s. While the business rescue has been instructed by a court, the judgement is being appealed by the airline. SA Express argues that the court “went over and above” the measures required and granted orders which were “not sought” by the applicant. “The court has also not made any order on whether the matter was urgent or not, in circumstances when the urgency was specifically opposed,” the airline adds. SA Express says it has instructed its lawyers to apply for leave to appeal. South African Airways was placed in business rescue in early December, as the airline continued to suffer heavy losses. SA Express had recently complained that it had been struggling to retrieve payments from SAA which, it claims, the flag-carrier owes. The regional operator said it had been working with SAA's practitioner, without success, to resolve the matter over the two months since SAA entered business rescue. SA Express chief executive Siza Mzimela – herself a former head of SAA – noted at the end of January that a “bleak economic forecast” is continuing to affect businesses in the country. “Our industry, in particular, is under much scrutiny as even more pressure is being exerted on government-owned airlines such as SA Express, whose validity of existence is increasingly questioned,” she says. But Mzimela insists that SA Express is playing a “critical role” by providing access to smaller markets. “It is always good to weigh the noise and adverse commentary in the public domain with SA Express's mandate as a strategic national asset,” she says. “While it is easy to make unfair and unrealistic comparisons as a case to do away with the airline, there's so much more to be considered. There is a huge contrast between SA Express and private competitors because they are purely commercial without any of the crucial nation-building subtleties required of this airline.”",2,714,8.0,0.3843,"government, uk, carrier, business, state, share, south, airway, financial, plan","['south', 'african', 'operator', 'sa', 'express', 'order', 'enter', 'business', 'rescue', 'month', 'similar', 'decision', 'make', 'flagcarrier', 'south', 'african', 'airway', 'sa', 'express', 'operates', 'route', 'network', 'southern', 'africa', 'use', 'fleet', 'bombardier', 'crjs', 'business', 'rescue', 'instruct', 'court', 'judgement', 'appeal', 'sa', 'express', 'argues', 'court', 'go', 'measure', 'require', 'grant', 'order', 'sought', 'applicant', 'court', 'make', 'order', 'whether', 'matter', 'urgent', 'circumstance', 'urgency', 'specifically', 'oppose', 'add', 'sa', 'express', 'say', 'instruct', 'lawyer', 'apply', 'leave', 'appeal', 'south', 'african', 'airway', 'place', 'business', 'rescue', 'early', 'december', 'continued', 'suffer', 'heavy', 'loss', 'sa', 'express', 'recently', 'complain', 'struggle', 'retrieve', 'payment', 'saa', 'claim', 'flagcarrier', 'owes', 'regional', 'operator', 'say', 'work', 'saa', 'practitioner', 'without', 'success', 'resolve', 'matter', 'month', 'since', 'saa', 'enter', 'business', 'rescue', 'sa', 'express', 'chief', 'executive', 'siza', 'mzimela', 'former', 'head', 'saa', 'note', 'end', 'january', 'bleak', 'economic', 'forecast', 'continue', 'affect', 'business', 'country', 'industry', 'particular', 'much', 'scrutiny', 'even', 'pressure', 'exert', 'governmentowned', 'sa', 'express', 'whose', 'validity', 'existence', 'increasingly', 'question', 'say', 'mzimela', 'insists', 'sa', 'express', 'play', 'critical', 'role', 'provide', 'access', 'small', 'market', 'always', 'good', 'weigh', 'noise', 'adverse', 'commentary', 'public', 'domain', 'sa', 'express', 'mandate', 'strategic', 'national', 'asset', 'say', 'easy', 'make', 'unfair', 'unrealistic', 'comparison', 'case', 'away', 'much', 'consider', 'huge', 'contrast', 'sa', 'express', 'private', 'competitor', 'purely', 'commercial', 'without', 'crucial', 'nationbuilding', 'subtlety', 'require']"
"Spanish investigators have detailed the poor airmanship by the crew of a Swiftair ATR 72-500 in the aftermath of a stall incident, as it proceeded to conduct an unstable approach and landing at Madrid. Investigation authority CIAIAC found that the turboprop stalled after the crew pushed the aircraft beyond its climb limits in icing conditions, during a flight from Alicante on 9 September 2017. After the pilots recovered from the stall they opted to proceed to Madrid and climb to 15,000ft – actions suggesting they considered the icing problem to have been resolved. But as the aircraft descended towards Madrid the crew became aware of an unexplained vibration and, at about 12,000ft, declared an emergency to air traffic control. Cockpit-voice recordings, which had been absent during the stall, returned during the descent and revealed conversations discussing the origin of the vibrations. The crew indicated they thought turbulence or a flap problem could be responsible. Concern about the flaps led the captain – who had taken over from the first officer as flying pilot – to decide to conduct a flapless approach and landing. But he did not request execution of any checklists, nor did the first officer remind him. “As a result, they were not performed,” says the inquiry. When the first officer asked about the flaps in the event of a go-around, the captain responded: “Don't even think of going around, we have to land.” CIAIAC says the captain's reply regarding a go-around, and failure to give the first officer any instructions, was “inappropriate” for a passenger transport flight, and showed an “obsession with landing at all costs”. The captain also noticed something on the runway but “rejected” the first officer's offer to inquire with air traffic control. Two marshalling vehicles undertaking a check were still occupying the runway at the time. Even though the captain had insisted on avoiding a go-around, there was little evidence of efforts to stabilise the approach. “A focus on landing is understandable in the sense of not wanting to prolong the flight, but it is precisely in order to achieve the landing that a stable and controlled approach should have been ensured,” says the inquiry. The descent rate exceeded 1,000ft/min, the airspeed exceeded the target speed by more than 20kt, and the absence of completed checklists meant the captain had to remind the first officer that they needed to remember to lower the landing gear. “Let's not forget, OK?” he said, according to the inquiry, which points out that checklists are intended to ensure pilots do not have to resort to memory. The captain instructed extension of the landing-gear at 840ft and 3nm from the runway, while the aircraft was flying at 204kt, despite the first officer's warning that the speed was too high for deploying the undercarriage. Only after cockpit alerts and further reminders from the first officer did the captain quickly reduce the speed, and the landing-gear was deployed at 539ft. While the first officer had monitored the aircraft's configuration, informing the captain of its position with respect to the glideslope and particularly its airspeed, this “did not have any effect” on the captain who “ignored” the first officer's observations. The descent rate was still 1,000ft/min at just 340ft and the cabin announcement to passengers to fasten their seat-belts was made at 216ft, only 23s before touchdown. CIAIAC says the ground-proximity warning system sounded a sequence of five alerts owing to the ATR's descending to a low height, without flaps, while travelling at high speed. These alerts “triggered no reaction”, the inquiry adds. The aircraft touched down one-third of the way along runway 32R at Madrid's Barajas airport, but the length of the runway meant the ATR was able to decelerate and stop without problems. One of the 22 passengers required medical assistance and the first officer requested an ambulance as the aircraft taxied to its parking position. CIAIAC has made multiple recommendations to Swiftair over the “deficiencies” in the way the flight and the stall were managed. These include ensuring crews have the required skills and knowledge covering several areas – among them flying in icing conditions, stall recovery, decision-making, crew resource management, and adherence to operating procedures.",2,715,7.0,0.5788,"crew, runway, inquiry, land, approach, accident, investigator, captain, incident, pilot","['spanish', 'investigator', 'detailed', 'poor', 'airmanship', 'crew', 'swiftair', 'atr', 'aftermath', 'stall', 'incident', 'proceed', 'conduct', 'unstable', 'approach', 'land', 'madrid', 'investigation', 'authority', 'ciaiac', 'found', 'turboprop', 'stall', 'crew', 'push', 'beyond', 'climb', 'limit', 'ice', 'condition', 'alicante', 'september', 'pilot', 'recover', 'stall', 'opt', 'proceed', 'madrid', 'climb', 'action', 'suggest', 'consider', 'ice', 'problem', 'resolve', 'descend', 'towards', 'madrid', 'crew', 'become', 'aware', 'unexplained', 'vibration', 'declare', 'emergency', 'traffic', 'control', 'cockpitvoice', 'recording', 'absent', 'stall', 'return', 'descent', 'reveal', 'conversation', 'discuss', 'origin', 'vibration', 'crew', 'indicate', 'thought', 'turbulence', 'flap', 'problem', 'responsible', 'concern', 'flap', 'lead', 'captain', 'take', 'officer', 'fly', 'pilot', 'decide', 'conduct', 'flapless', 'approach', 'land', 'request', 'execution', 'checklist', 'officer', 'remind', 'result', 'perform', 'say', 'inquiry', 'officer', 'ask', 'flap', 'event', 'goaround', 'captain', 'respond', 'even', 'think', 'go', 'around', 'ciaiac', 'say', 'captain', 'reply', 'regard', 'goaround', 'failure', 'give', 'officer', 'instruction', 'inappropriate', 'passenger', 'transport', 'obsession', 'land', 'cost', 'captain', 'notice', 'something', 'runway', 'reject', 'officer', 'offer', 'inquire', 'traffic', 'control', 'marshal', 'vehicle', 'undertaking', 'check', 'still', 'occupy', 'runway', 'even', 'though', 'captain', 'insist', 'avoid', 'goaround', 'little', 'evidence', 'effort', 'stabilise', 'approach', 'focus', 'land', 'understandable', 'sense', 'want', 'prolong', 'precisely', 'order', 'achieve', 'land', 'stable', 'control', 'approach', 'ensure', 'say', 'inquiry', 'descent', 'rate', 'exceed', 'airspeed', 'exceed', 'target', 'speed', 'absence', 'complete', 'checklist', 'meant', 'captain', 'remind', 'officer', 'need', 'remember', 'low', 'land', 'gear', 'let', 'forget', 'ok', 'say', 'accord', 'inquiry', 'point', 'checklist', 'intend', 'ensure', 'pilot', 'resort', 'memory', 'captain', 'instruct', 'extension', 'landinggear', 'runway', 'fly', 'despite', 'officer', 'warn', 'speed', 'high', 'deploy', 'undercarriage', 'cockpit', 'alert', 'far', 'reminder', 'officer', 'captain', 'quickly', 'reduce', 'speed', 'landinggear', 'deployed', 'officer', 'monitor', 'configuration', 'inform', 'captain', 'position', 'respect', 'glideslope', 'particularly', 'airspeed', 'effect', 'captain', 'ignore', 'officer', 'observation', 'descent', 'rate', 'still', 'cabin', 'announcement', 'passenger', 'fasten', 'seatbelt', 'make', 'touchdown', 'ciaiac', 'say', 'groundproximity', 'warn', 'system', 'sound', 'sequence', 'alert', 'owe', 'atr', 'descend', 'low', 'height', 'without', 'flap', 'travel', 'high', 'speed', 'alert', 'trigger', 'reaction', 'inquiry', 'add', 'touch', 'onethird', 'way', 'along', 'runway', 'madrid', 'barajas', 'airport', 'length', 'runway', 'meant', 'atr', 'able', 'decelerate', 'stop', 'without', 'problem', 'passenger', 'require', 'medical', 'assistance', 'officer', 'request', 'ambulance', 'taxi', 'parking', 'position', 'ciaiac', 'make', 'multiple', 'recommendation', 'swiftair', 'deficiency', 'way', 'stall', 'manage', 'include', 'ensure', 'crew', 'require', 'skill', 'knowledge', 'cover', 'several', 'area', 'among', 'fly', 'ice', 'condition', 'stall', 'recovery', 'decisionmaking', 'crew', 'resource', 'management', 'adherence', 'operating', 'procedure']"
"Three fatalities have been confirmed as a result of the overrun and break-up of a Pegasus Airlines Boeing 737-800 during its landing roll at Istanbul Sabiha Gokcen airport. Initial indications had suggested all those on board had survived the 5 February accident, during which the aircraft failed to stop on runway 06 as it arrived from Izmir. It tipped over a steep embankment and came to rest some 200m from the runway end, its fuselage fracturing into three sections. Turkish investigators are likely to be examining the weather conditions at the time of the overrun, and whether the decision to land on runway 06 – which was experiencing gusting tailwinds, according to Sabiha Gokcen's meteorological data – contributed to the overrun. The aircraft, operating flight PC2193 from Izmir under the callsign 'Sunturk 87R', was advised of a westerly wind with a speed of 22kt, gusting to 34kt, when it was cleared to land, according to tower communications archived by LiveATC. This would have generated a tailwind for the arriving 737. At least two other preceding flights, both operated by Turkish Airlines, on approach to the runway appear to have opted to execute a go-around. Shortly after the landing clearance to the Pegasus flight another aircraft waiting to taxi was advised by air traffic control that the “runway will change” because the wind was from 270° at 25kt. Turkey's civil aviation authority states that the 737 landed at 18:19 and was carrying 177 passengers and six crew members. It says 139 injured occupants were transferred to 18 different hospitals. Pegasus has confirmed three fatalities, citing official information, without elaborating on whether they are passengers or crew. “We are deploying every resource to support those affected by this accident,” it states. This accident is likely to draw attention to Pegasus's operating record. The fatal Sabiha Gokcen accident is the second excursion suffered by the airline in a month at the airport, and comes just two years after another major excursion accident at Trabzon during which a 737-800 was left badly damaged and precariously perched on a cliff edge.

"Economic vulnerability in China, a potential trade war, as well as severe effects from the new coronavirus are three of the biggest risks the global aviation and aerospace industry faces at the start of the new decade. China's progressively higher debt levels in the past ten years, slower growth, lower foreign direct investment and other tenuous economic indicators all point to a deceleration of the world's second biggest economy. Major aerospace companies and their suppliers in the US and Europe are feeling the effects, but these could be even more damaging in the long term, industry experts tell participants at the Pacific Northwest Aerospace Alliance meeting in Lynnwood, Washington on 5 February. “[China's] government has been cheerfully throwing money at the problem and I think they might have a debt issue at this point,” says Richard Aboulafia, vice president of analysis at Teal Group. “Their GDP numbers probably aren't as good as they say they are. This is a broader China issue that's affecting our market beyond the Max.” China Southern 737 Max Gross domestic product growth is at its weakest in about 30 years. In 2019, GDP growth was 6.1%, and some analysts expect to see first quarter growth of just 4%. “Our expectation is, they're going to take a little break for two years,” Aboulafia says. “I wouldn't be expecting any great deals from China in general for the next basically year and a half to two years.” China is one of the biggest markets for the 737 Max programme and last year's delivery freeze tore a hole in the single-aisle market including in the fleets of Air China, China Southern Airlines and Hainan Airlines. Cirum's Fleets Analyzer shows that Chinese carriers have 97 737 Max aircraft in storage, with a further 178 on order. The Civil Aviation Administration of China was also the first country to ground the type in March after the second of two fatal crashes. The aircraft's global grounding is now in its 11thmonth, with the expectation that it will not be recertificated until well into 2020, and won't likely return to revenue service until the third quarter. Late in January, Boeing also said it would reduce 787 Dreamliner production to ten units per month (from 14) from early 2021, driven largely by a dearth of orders from China as well as a reduced near-term requirement for wide-body replacements. The coronavirus, which originated in mainland China, has now sickened almost 30,000 and killed 563 as of Wednesday. Entire cities and large swaths of the country have been quarantined and many foreign carriers have cancelled all flights to Chinese destinations, bringing the country to a near-standstill. TRADE TURBULENCE Adding to the current short-term economic pain, a potential China-US trade war threatens to become hotter should Donald Trump be elected to a second term as US President. A protracted and expensive commercial conflict will have detrimental long-term effects on the US aerospace ecosystem, industry experts say. ”If Trump is relected I would expect the Chinese trade war to go full game on,” says Ron Epstein, managing director for aerospace and defence, Global Research at Bank of America Securities. China and the US in January inked the first phase of a new trade deal, but the trade turbulence between the two countries is far from over. The pact, effective immediately, calls for China to purchase a total of $200 billion in US goods above the 2017 baseline, and includes $77.7 million in manufactured goods, but it is short on details. “What's going to come out of this trade crisis is the seed of a strong competitor from about 2030 or 2035, and the seed of a country that is going to leverage its level of influence for its aerospace industry,” says Michel Merluzeau, director of market analysis for Air Insight Research. “That is concerning to me because we are decoupling a system that has worked very well over the last 50 years. So those unintended consequences will have an effect on the competitiveness of Airbus and Boeing.” In essence, China is in the process of building up its own aerospace ecosystem with reliable suppliers and high standards as a direct competitor to the western world. US export control regulations have prevented aerospace and aviation companies from setting up manufacturing operations in China, leaving technology development  and construction to home-grown entrepreneurs. “You see two spheres of technology and two areas of economic development,” says Epstein. “You can't have a Cold War with China the same way you did with the Soviet Union because they are a major trading partner and that's not lost on anybody. So you have a major trading partner who is also a security threat.” As a result, the trade war of 2019 will be followed by a tech war between China and the United States, he adds. “There is no way around that.” ",2,717,9.0,0.317,"industry, crisis, demand, coronavirus, global, iata, market, level, cargo, expect","['economic', 'vulnerability', 'potential', 'trade', 'war', 'well', 'severe', 'effect', 'coronavirus', 'big', 'risk', 'global', 'industry', 'face', 'start', 'decade', 'progressively', 'high', 'debt', 'level', 'past', 'slow', 'growth', 'low', 'foreign', 'direct', 'investment', 'tenuous', 'economic', 'indicator', 'point', 'deceleration', 'world', 'second', 'big', 'economy', 'major', 'supplier', 'u', 'europe', 'feel', 'effect', 'even', 'damage', 'long', 'term', 'industry', 'expert', 'tell', 'participant', 'pacific', 'northwest', 'alliance', 'meeting', 'lynnwood', 'washington', 'february', 'government', 'cheerfully', 'throw', 'money', 'problem', 'think', 'might', 'debt', 'issue', 'point', 'say', 'richard', 'aboulafia', 'vice', 'president', 'analysis', 'teal', 'gdp', 'number', 'probably', 'good', 'say', 'broader', 'issue', 'affect', 'market', 'beyond', 'southern', 'gross', 'domestic', 'product', 'growth', 'weak', 'gdp', 'growth', 'analyst', 'expect', 'see', 'quarter', 'growth', 'expectation', 'go', 'take', 'little', 'break', 'aboulafia', 'say', 'expect', 'great', 'deal', 'general', 'next', 'basically', 'half', 'big', 'market', 'programme', 'delivery', 'freeze', 'tore', 'hole', 'singleaisle', 'market', 'include', 'fleet', 'southern', 'hainan', 'cirum', 'fleet', 'analyzer', 'chinese', 'carrier', 'storage', 'far', 'order', 'civil', 'administration', 'country', 'ground', 'type', 'march', 'second', 'fatal', 'crash', 'global', 'ground', 'expectation', 'recertificated', 'well', 'wo', 'likely', 'return', 'revenue', 'service', 'third', 'quarter', 'late', 'january', 'say', 'reduce', 'dreamliner', 'production', 'unit', 'per', 'month', 'early', 'driven', 'largely', 'dearth', 'order', 'well', 'reduce', 'nearterm', 'requirement', 'widebody', 'replacement', 'coronavirus', 'originate', 'mainland', 'sicken', 'almost', 'kill', 'wednesday', 'entire', 'city', 'large', 'swath', 'country', 'quarantine', 'many', 'foreign', 'carrier', 'cancel', 'chinese', 'destination', 'bring', 'country', 'nearstandstill', 'trade', 'turbulence', 'add', 'current', 'shortterm', 'economic', 'pain', 'potential', 'chinaus', 'trade', 'war', 'threatens', 'become', 'hotter', 'donald', 'trump', 'elect', 'second', 'term', 'u', 'president', 'protract', 'expensive', 'commercial', 'conflict', 'detrimental', 'longterm', 'effect', 'u', 'ecosystem', 'industry', 'expert', 'say', 'trump', 'relected', 'expect', 'chinese', 'trade', 'war', 'go', 'full', 'game', 'say', 'ron', 'epstein', 'manage', 'director', 'defence', 'global', 'research', 'bank', 'america', 'security', 'u', 'january', 'inked', 'phase', 'trade', 'deal', 'trade', 'turbulence', 'country', 'far', 'pact', 'effective', 'immediately', 'call', 'purchase', 'total', 'u', 'good', 'baseline', 'include', 'manufacture', 'good', 'short', 'detail', 'go', 'come', 'trade', 'crisis', 'seed', 'strong', 'competitor', 'seed', 'country', 'go', 'leverage', 'level', 'influence', 'industry', 'say', 'michel', 'merluzeau', 'director', 'market', 'analysis', 'insight', 'research', 'concern', 'decouple', 'system', 'work', 'well', 'unintended', 'consequence', 'effect', 'competitiveness', 'essence', 'process', 'building', 'ecosystem', 'reliable', 'supplier', 'high', 'standard', 'direct', 'competitor', 'western', 'world', 'u', 'export', 'control', 'regulation', 'prevent', 'set', 'manufacturing', 'operation', 'leave', 'technology', 'development', 'construction', 'homegrown', 'entrepreneur', 'see', 'sphere', 'technology', 'area', 'economic', 'development', 'say', 'epstein', 'ca', 'cold', 'war', 'way', 'soviet', 'union', 'major', 'trading', 'partner', 'lose', 'anybody', 'major', 'trading', 'partner', 'security', 'result', 'trade', 'war', 'follow', 'tech', 'war', 'united', 'state', 'add', 'way', 'around']"
"Last year brought the steepest decline in demand for air freight since 2009, newly released IATA data shows. Freight tonne-kilometres fell 3.3%. “This was the first year of declining freight volumes since 2012, and the weakest performance since the global financial crisis in 2009 (when air freight markets contracted by 9.7%),” IATA notes. The sector has been hit by falling global trade volumes – they were down 0.9% in 2019 – as well as slowing growth in manufacturing-intensive economies, softer business and consumer confidence, and weaker export orders. While demand fell, capacity as measured by available freight-tonne kilometres increased by 2.1%. “Trade tensions are at the root of the worst year for air cargo since the end of the global financial crisis in 2009,” states IATA director general Alexandre de Juniac. “While these are easing, there is little relief in that good news as we are in unknown territory with respect to the eventual impact of the coronavirus on the global economy.” He warns that 2020 will be “another challenging year for the air cargo business”. In December 2019, air freight cargo volumes fell 2.7%, as capacity was lifted 2.8%. IATA's data shows that all regions of the world bar Africa posted declines in freight tonne-kilometres for the month. Latin America saw the steepest drop, of 5.3%, followed by Asia Pacific (3.5%) and the Middle East and North America (both 3.4%). Capacity was increased 10% in Africa, 4.9% in Europe, 2.8% in Asia-Pacific and 2.1% in North America.",2,718,9.0,0.4147,"industry, crisis, demand, coronavirus, global, iata, market, level, cargo, expect","['brought', 'steepest', 'decline', 'demand', 'freight', 'since', 'newly', 'release', 'iata', 'data', 'freight', 'tonnekilometres', 'fell', 'decline', 'freight', 'volume', 'since', 'weak', 'performance', 'since', 'global', 'financial', 'crisis', 'freight', 'market', 'contract', 'iata', 'note', 'sector', 'hit', 'fall', 'global', 'trade', 'volume', 'well', 'slow', 'growth', 'manufacturingintensive', 'economy', 'softer', 'business', 'consumer', 'confidence', 'weaker', 'export', 'order', 'demand', 'fell', 'capacity', 'measure', 'available', 'freighttonne', 'kilometre', 'increase', 'trade', 'tension', 'root', 'bad', 'cargo', 'since', 'end', 'global', 'financial', 'crisis', 'state', 'iata', 'director', 'general', 'alexandre', 'de', 'juniac', 'ease', 'little', 'relief', 'good', 'news', 'unknown', 'territory', 'respect', 'eventual', 'impact', 'coronavirus', 'global', 'warns', 'another', 'challenge', 'cargo', 'business', 'december', 'freight', 'cargo', 'volume', 'fell', 'capacity', 'lift', 'iata', 'data', 'region', 'world', 'bar', 'africa', 'post', 'decline', 'freight', 'tonnekilometres', 'month', 'latin', 'america', 'saw', 'steepest', 'drop', 'follow', 'asia', 'pacific', 'middle', 'east', 'north', 'america', 'capacity', 'increase', 'africa', 'europe', 'asiapacific', 'north', 'america']"
"The US Special Operations Command plans on buying 75 fixed-wing aircraft for its just-announced Armed Overwatch programme. The aircraft are intended for close air support of special operations troops, according to a notice announcing an upcoming industry day posted online 3 February. “Armed Overwatch will provide Special Operations Forces deployable and sustainable manned aircraft systems fulfilling close air support, precision strike, and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance in austere and permissive environments,” says the notice. The programme is similar to a faltering light attack experiment within the US Air Force (USAF), which aims to show light attack aircraft, specifically the Textron Aviation AT-6 and Sierra Nevada /Embraer A-29, could cheaply boost the air-to-ground attack capabilities of US allies and foreign partners. To further that experiment, the service announced in October 2019 that it planned to give Textron and Sierra Nevada orders for purchase of two to three light attack aircraft each. The Armed Overwatch programme is closer to the USAF light attack experiment's original goal of providing the US military with a cheaper alternative for air-to-ground attack missions, compared with expensive-to-fly fourth and fifth generation fighters such as the Boeing F-15E or Lockheed Martin F-35. Air superiority is often the USA's trump card, especially when patrolling or fighting on the ground with small numbers of troops. The issue came to the top of the Pentagon's priorities after four US soldiers were killed in an ambush in Niger by the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara in 2017, partly due to lack of air cover. Turboprop light attack aircraft, such as the AT-7 and A-29, can carry machine guns, rockets, missiles and precision bombs. US Special Operations Command plans to host an industry day on 4 March – 5 March to explain the Armed Overwatch programme to prospective bidders. Initially, Armed Overwatch would be pursued as a prototype initiative to demonstrate the concept, says US Special Operations Command. If the demonstration phase proves promising enough, US Special Operations Command plans to award a follow-on contract with a base 5-year ordering period, plus a 2-year option, for 75 aircraft and MRO support.",2,719,1.0,0.4777,"test, force, helicopter, fire, system, service, attack, design, usaf, missile","['u', 'special', 'operation', 'command', 'plan', 'buying', 'fixedwing', 'justannounced', 'arm', 'overwatch', 'programme', 'intend', 'close', 'support', 'special', 'operation', 'troop', 'accord', 'notice', 'announce', 'upcoming', 'industry', 'day', 'post', 'online', 'february', 'arm', 'overwatch', 'provide', 'special', 'operation', 'force', 'deployable', 'sustainable', 'man', 'system', 'fulfil', 'close', 'support', 'precision', 'strike', 'intelligence', 'surveillance', 'reconnaissance', 'austere', 'permissive', 'environment', 'say', 'notice', 'programme', 'similar', 'falter', 'light', 'attack', 'experiment', 'within', 'u', 'force', 'usaf', 'aim', 'light', 'attack', 'specifically', 'textron', 'sierra', 'nevada', 'cheaply', 'boost', 'airtoground', 'attack', 'capability', 'u', 'ally', 'foreign', 'partner', 'far', 'experiment', 'service', 'announce', 'october', 'plan', 'give', 'textron', 'sierra', 'nevada', 'order', 'purchase', 'light', 'attack', 'arm', 'overwatch', 'programme', 'closer', 'usaf', 'light', 'attack', 'experiment', 'original', 'goal', 'provide', 'u', 'military', 'cheaper', 'alternative', 'airtoground', 'attack', 'mission', 'compare', 'expensivetofly', 'fourth', 'fifth', 'generation', 'fighter', 'lockheed', 'martin', 'superiority', 'often', 'usa', 'trump', 'card', 'especially', 'patrol', 'fight', 'ground', 'small', 'number', 'troop', 'issue', 'come', 'top', 'pentagon', 'priority', 'u', 'soldier', 'kill', 'ambush', 'niger', 'islamic', 'state', 'great', 'sahara', 'partly', 'due', 'lack', 'cover', 'turboprop', 'light', 'attack', 'carry', 'machine', 'gun', 'rocket', 'missile', 'precision', 'bomb', 'u', 'special', 'operation', 'command', 'plan', 'host', 'industry', 'day', 'march', 'march', 'explain', 'arm', 'overwatch', 'programme', 'prospective', 'bidder', 'initially', 'arm', 'overwatch', 'pursue', 'prototype', 'initiative', 'demonstrate', 'concept', 'say', 'u', 'special', 'operation', 'command', 'demonstration', 'phase', 'prof', 'promising', 'enough', 'u', 'special', 'operation', 'command', 'plan', 'award', 'followon', 'contract', 'base', 'order', 'period', 'plus', 'option', 'mro', 'support']"
"Industry experts say Boeing must move quickly towards making a decision on its new mid-market airplane (NMA), a project it has been talking about for years but was recently put on the back burner as it continues to deal with the fallout from the year-long 737 Max crisis. Last week, Boeing chief executive David Calhoun put the brakes on the NMA project as the Chicago-based planemaker reassesses which segment of the market it should target for its next aircraft. “The challenge has been, can you build a twin-aisle that has the economics of a single aisle? I have my doubts,” says industry analyst Richard Aboulafia, vice-president at the Teal Group, speaking to participants at the Pacific Northwest Aerospace Alliance conference in Lynnwood, Washington on 5 February. “When it comes to Calhoun's decision to push this decision off, I agree with that, understand the concern, but if they don't turn on a dime and launch something for that midsize space, the consequences will be dire.” For several years Boeing has talked of launching the NMA, an aircraft with about 270 seats and 4,000-5,000nm (7,400-9,300km) range. But the 737 Max grounding delayed the NMA beyond an ideal mid-2020s launch, and in the meantime Airbus has attacked the mid-market niche with the 2019 launch of its A321XLR. As a result, Boeing is at risk of being left behind in this space, as more-efficient and lower-operating-cost single-aisle aircraft begin to outsell twin-aisle aircraft almost two-to-one. ”What used to be a 50-50 market between single-aisles and twin-aisles is increasingly two thirds, one third, and could easily be 70-30. There's a long term secular shift in favor of single aisles,”Abioulafia says. ”The Max is a very serious situation for the business, but it's also serving to mask what I think is the biggest challenge that Boeing has faced in many decades, which is that because of the Max, their ability to respond to this major secular shift in the market, coupled with a major competitive threat, is jeopardised.” Airlines will need the NMA as soon as the middle of the coming decade to replace aging 757 and 767 fleets. If Boeing does not launch a new programme soon, all of those operators, including airline heavyweights United and Delta Airlines, which together currently operate more than 330 of these aircraft according to Cirium fleets data, might turn to Airbus' efficient, modern extra-long range single-aisle aircraft. These operators want to expand existing transcontinental routes and create new intercontinental routes, and would like to have an alternate to the Airbus aircraft. United announced in December it ordered 50 Airbus A321XLR. Deliveries are scheduled to begin in 2024. Last week, Calhoun told analysts the company is assessing which segment of the commercial aircraft market it should actually address with its next aircraft development programme, suggesting options other than the NMA . The manufacturer, he added, will not design its next aircraft purely as a response to the hugely-popular Airbus A321neo, and will center its development around the flight control system and how pilots interact with that system – a topic highlighted by the 737 Max crashes. “The market is fundamentally the same,” Randy Tinseth, Boeing's vice-president of marketing says on 4 February. “Without question, over the last few years the competition has changed its strategy, and Dave's ask of us is to take step back and a look at that, and that's the right thing to do.”",2,720,0.0,0.2148,"order, business, jet, delivery, production, customer, deliver, commercial, quarter, include","['industry', 'expert', 'say', 'must', 'move', 'quickly', 'towards', 'make', 'decision', 'midmarket', 'airplane', 'nma', 'project', 'talk', 'recently', 'put', 'back', 'burner', 'continue', 'deal', 'fallout', 'yearlong', 'crisis', 'week', 'chief', 'executive', 'david', 'calhoun', 'put', 'brake', 'nma', 'project', 'chicagobased', 'planemaker', 'reassesses', 'segment', 'market', 'target', 'next', 'challenge', 'build', 'twinaisle', 'economics', 'single', 'aisle', 'doubt', 'say', 'industry', 'analyst', 'richard', 'aboulafia', 'vicepresident', 'teal', 'speak', 'participant', 'pacific', 'northwest', 'alliance', 'conference', 'lynnwood', 'washington', 'february', 'come', 'calhoun', 'decision', 'push', 'decision', 'agree', 'understand', 'concern', 'turn', 'dime', 'launch', 'something', 'midsize', 'space', 'consequence', 'several', 'talk', 'launch', 'nma', 'seat', 'range', 'ground', 'delayed', 'nma', 'beyond', 'ideal', 'launch', 'meantime', 'attack', 'midmarket', 'niche', 'launch', 'result', 'risk', 'left', 'behind', 'space', 'moreefficient', 'loweroperatingcost', 'singleaisle', 'begin', 'outsell', 'twinaisle', 'almost', 'twotoone', 'use', 'market', 'singleaisles', 'twinaisles', 'increasingly', 'third', 'third', 'easily', 'long', 'term', 'secular', 'shift', 'favor', 'single', 'aisle', 'abioulafia', 'say', 'serious', 'situation', 'business', 'serve', 'mask', 'think', 'big', 'challenge', 'face', 'many', 'decade', 'ability', 'respond', 'major', 'secular', 'shift', 'market', 'couple', 'major', 'competitive', 'threat', 'need', 'nma', 'soon', 'middle', 'come', 'decade', 'replace', 'age', 'fleet', 'launch', 'programme', 'soon', 'operator', 'include', 'heavyweight', 'united', 'delta', 'together', 'currently', 'operate', 'accord', 'fleet', 'data', 'might', 'turn', 'efficient', 'modern', 'extralong', 'range', 'singleaisle', 'operator', 'want', 'expand', 'exist', 'transcontinental', 'route', 'create', 'intercontinental', 'route', 'like', 'alternate', 'united', 'announce', 'december', 'order', 'delivery', 'schedule', 'begin', 'week', 'calhoun', 'told', 'analyst', 'assess', 'segment', 'commercial', 'market', 'actually', 'address', 'next', 'development', 'programme', 'suggest', 'option', 'nma', 'manufacturer', 'add', 'design', 'next', 'purely', 'response', 'hugelypopular', 'center', 'development', 'around', 'control', 'system', 'pilot', 'interact', 'system', 'topic', 'highlight', 'crash', 'market', 'fundamentally', 'randy', 'tinseth', 'vicepresident', 'marketing', 'say', 'february', 'without', 'question', 'competition', 'change', 'strategy', 'dave', 'ask', 'u', 'take', 'step', 'back', 'look', 'right', 'thing']"
"Airbus A350 operators have been ordered to define a “liquid prohibited” zone in the cockpit, after two incidents in which beverage spillages on the centre pedestal led to in-flight shutdown of a Rolls-Royce Trent XWB engine. FlightGlobal exclusively revealed last month that a liquid spill had preceded a Delta Air Lines A350 shutdown and diversion on 21 January, and that a spill on an Asian carrier's A350 was suspected to have resulted in a similar shutdown and diversion last November. In an emergency directive the European Union Aviation Safety Agency has warned that inadvertent spillage on the engine-start panel or electronic centralised aircraft monitor panel – both located on the pedestal – could potentially result in a dual engine shutdown.  EASA is warning that spills could lead to dual-engine shutdown on A350s Preliminary technical investigation, it says, indicates “abnormal operation” of components in the panels resulting from the spillages. Uncommanded shutdown followed “some time” after the spillage and subsequent engine relight attempts were not successful. Airbus has published a temporary revision to the aircraft's flight manual, dated 4 February, defining a “liquid prohibited zone” for the cockpit and the procedures to be followed in case of a pedestal spillage. It has also published an operator communication reminding airlines about standard practices for handling liquids in the cockpit.

"Weather data from Istanbul's Sabiha Gokcen airport indicates rain and a strong tailwind component at the time when a landing Pegasus Airlines Boeing 737-800 overran the runway and broke up. Emergency services are attending the scene of the accident. Pegasus says injured passengers have been taken to hospital but states that there have been no fatalities. The twinjet – which the carrier has identified as TC-IZK – had been arriving from Izmir at around 18:15, as flight PC2193. It overran the end of runway 06 and travelled down an embankment, its fuselage fracturing, and came to rest with its cockpit section having separated and rolled upside-down. NOTAM data for the airport states that “due to aircraft crash” the single runway 06/24 – which is 3,000m long – is closed. Pegasus Airlines has yet to confirm further details about the number of passengers injured. Meteorological data from Sabiha Gokcen at the time of the accident shows rain showers and cumulonimbus cloud in the vicinity. But it also points to winds from 290k at 22kt – and gusting to 37kt – which would result in a tailwind component of 14-24kt as well as a crosswind element for runway 06. The accident is the second serious event involving a Pegasus aircraft in less than a month.

"Cathay Pacificis encouraging its employees to take three weeks of unpaid leave, in a bid to save money, after being forced to slash capacity by 30% as a result of falling demand related to China's coronavirus outbreak. “Preserving cash is the key to protecting our business,” says the Hong Kong airline in an emailed statement. “We have already been taking multiple measures to achieve this. Today, we are appealing to all employees to participate in the special leave scheme (SLS), which will take effect from 1 March and last until 30 June. “All employees will have the option to take three weeks of unpaid leave in this period.” The carrier on 4 February revealed a planned 90% reduction in mainland China flights and an overall capacity cut of almost a third in response to the coronavirus outbreak.

"Prosecutors should pursue Airbus executives alleged to have participated in bribery on behalf of the airframer, the anti-corruption organisation Transparency International is insisting. Airbus has settled a four-year investigation into the manufacturer through a deferred prosecution agreement which enabled the company to avoid a conviction, although the fraud probe in relation to individuals remains active. Transparency International, which publishes an annual corruption perception index ranking countries' vulnerability to such activity, has welcomed the €3.6 billion penalty. But it UK division adds: “Failing to hold individuals to account will damage public confidence and risks setting a precedent where big companies can buy their way out of trouble.” Transparency International UK argues that corporate deferred prosecution arrangements are only successful if they are complemented by prosecutions against individuals alleged to be responsible for wrongdoing. Airbus was fined €3.6 billion under the deferred prosecution arrangement Engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce reached a similar deferred prosecution deal, involving a £497 million penalty, with the UK Serious Fraud Office in January 2017. The company had been accused of activities including failure to prevent bribery in association with supplying Airbus A330 engines to Garuda Indonesia and Boeing 777 engines to Thai Airways International. But while the Serious Fraud Office investigation continued for another two years, it closed in February 2019, with the organisation admitting that there would be “no prosecution of individuals associated with the company”. Its justified the decision by stating that it had examined the case extensively, but concluded there was either “insufficient evidence” for a realistic prospect of conviction or that prosecution was “not in the public interest”. No decision has yet been reached in the Airbus case.

"Spanish investigators have determined that a Swiftair ATR 72-500 stalled while climbing through icing conditions as a result of the pilots' failure to manage the flight correctly and their “inappropriate” use of automation. The turboprop (EC-KKQ) lost airspeed and height and rolled to excessive bank angles during the Alicante-Madrid service on 9 September 2017, and the captain's response suggests he initially did not recognise that the aircraft was stalling. Eight minutes before the stall the aircraft had entered icing conditions which then worsened into severe icing. Investigation authority CIAIAC says the pilots received a degraded-performance warning but did not carry out the associated checklist. They “did not consider” the ATR's behaviour as they fixated on its climb, says the inquiry, forcing the aircraft to its limits and then attempting to climb “beyond” these limits. Their focus on climbing resulted in their selecting autopilot modes which were prohibited in icing conditions, including vertical-speed mode, leading to a severe degradation in performance and the stall just above 17,000ft. The ATR lost more than 1,660ft in altitude in 33s and experienced a series of uncommanded pitch attitudes – from 6° nose-up to 11° nose-down – and bank angles, rolling from 58° left to 11° right and then back to 41° left. It also reached a maximum angle of attack of 19.6°. CIAIAC says weather information had been provided to the crew anticipating that much of the flight would take place in icing conditions, with moderate icing at 14,000-15,000ft over the waypoint NARGO. “The reality of what happened in the flight showed that, in effect, icing occurred near that point, only it was worse than forecast,” the inquiry states. But the crew did not adhere to procedures during the climb, selecting a climb rate above the published aircraft performance and failing to maintain speed above the minimum for severe icing. Three minutes before the event, the aircraft was unable to keep climbing and, 35s before, the speed began to drop. “These are clear indications, and are described as such in the procedure, that the aircraft's performance was degrading,” the inquiry says, pointing out that the crew had already been issued cautions of ice build-up and increasing drag. “The crew only considered the visual indications [of icing] and did not take into account the rest of the information.” Investigators catalogued a series of deviations, including the failure to use the target speed of 170kt for icing conditions, climbing in 'pitch' mode despite none of the conditions for this mode being present, and failing to follow procedures – including disengaging the autopilot – when the aircraft's performance degraded. Owing to the autopilot's remaining active, says the inquiry, “the abnormal feel of the flight controls could not be checked” despite the performance indications. Sixteen seconds after the degraded performance caution turned on, the aircraft reached 16,200ft and was unable to climb further, holding this altitude for 90s. Despite the evidence for a loss of performance, the crew commanded a series of actions to force the aircraft to climb beyond its capabilities – changing the power-management selector to maximum continuous thrust, and switching the autopilot to the vertical-speed mode with a climb rate of 500ft/min, even though this mode was banned during icing. When the aircraft did not react as the pilots expected, they increased the climb rate to 1,100ft/min in a bid to break through cloud. “According to the crew's statement, they were about to clear the cloud layer and thought that climbing – and not descending – was the best option to escape the icing,” says the inquiry, adding that the crew was “completely focused on this objective” and “ignored the cautions” from the aircraft. CIAIAC also points out that, although the first officer was the flying pilot, the captain violated task assignments by carrying out certain activities including changing the power-management setting. The captain had much more experience than the first officer – some 18,000h against 1,400h – and this probably influenced the first officer's ability to oppose any decisions. The actions during the climb were “inconsistent” with procedures and recommendations from the operator and ATR, says the inquiry. “Though some were initially inconsequential...others did have consequences,” it says. Cockpit-voice communications were not available to the investigation. But flight-data recorder information shows that, as the aircraft stalled, the captain applied four nose-up inputs over the course of 21s – suggesting he “did not seem” to recognise the stall, and appeared fixated on climbing. The first officer, however, did appear to identify the stall, because he made two nose-down inputs to the controls at the same time as the captain was making inputs in the opposite direction. Throttle levers were moved to the maximum-power position, despite this not being part of the stall-recovery procedure, and the required extension of flaps to 15° was not carried out. Despite the events only one person, one of the 22 passengers, sustained minor injuries during the incident. The crew recovered the aircraft and proceed to Madrid, although the inquiry has also highlighted that the ATR conducted a high-speed and unstable approach during its arrival.",2,725,7.0,0.5607,"crew, runway, inquiry, land, approach, accident, investigator, captain, incident, pilot","['spanish', 'investigator', 'determine', 'swiftair', 'atr', 'stall', 'climb', 'ice', 'condition', 'result', 'pilot', 'failure', 'manage', 'correctly', 'inappropriate', 'use', 'automation', 'turboprop', 'eckkq', 'lose', 'airspeed', 'height', 'roll', 'excessive', 'bank', 'angle', 'alicantemadrid', 'service', 'september', 'captain', 'response', 'suggests', 'initially', 'recognise', 'stall', 'minute', 'stall', 'enter', 'ice', 'condition', 'worsen', 'severe', 'ice', 'investigation', 'authority', 'ciaiac', 'say', 'pilot', 'receive', 'degradedperformance', 'warn', 'carry', 'associate', 'checklist', 'consider', 'atr', 'behaviour', 'fixate', 'climb', 'say', 'inquiry', 'force', 'limit', 'attempt', 'climb', 'beyond', 'limit', 'focus', 'climb', 'result', 'select', 'autopilot', 'mode', 'prohibit', 'ice', 'condition', 'include', 'verticalspeed', 'mode', 'lead', 'severe', 'degradation', 'performance', 'stall', 'atr', 'lose', 'altitude', 'experienced', 'series', 'uncommanded', 'pitch', 'attitude', 'noseup', 'nosedown', 'bank', 'angle', 'roll', 'left', 'right', 'back', 'left', 'reach', 'maximum', 'angle', 'attack', 'ciaiac', 'say', 'weather', 'information', 'provide', 'crew', 'anticipate', 'much', 'take', 'place', 'ice', 'condition', 'moderate', 'ice', 'waypoint', 'nargo', 'reality', 'happen', 'effect', 'ice', 'occur', 'near', 'point', 'bad', 'forecast', 'inquiry', 'state', 'crew', 'adhere', 'procedure', 'climb', 'select', 'climb', 'rate', 'publish', 'performance', 'fail', 'maintain', 'speed', 'minimum', 'severe', 'ice', 'minute', 'event', 'unable', 'keep', 'climb', 'speed', 'begin', 'drop', 'clear', 'indication', 'described', 'procedure', 'performance', 'degrade', 'inquiry', 'say', 'point', 'crew', 'already', 'issue', 'caution', 'ice', 'buildup', 'increase', 'drag', 'crew', 'consider', 'visual', 'indication', 'ice', 'take', 'account', 'rest', 'investigator', 'catalogue', 'series', 'deviation', 'include', 'failure', 'use', 'target', 'speed', 'ice', 'condition', 'climb', 'mode', 'despite', 'none', 'condition', 'mode', 'present', 'fail', 'follow', 'procedure', 'include', 'disengage', 'autopilot', 'performance', 'degrade', 'owe', 'autopilot', 'remain', 'active', 'say', 'inquiry', 'abnormal', 'feel', 'control', 'checked', 'despite', 'performance', 'indication', 'sixteen', 'second', 'degrade', 'performance', 'caution', 'turn', 'reach', 'unable', 'climb', 'far', 'hold', 'altitude', 'despite', 'evidence', 'loss', 'performance', 'crew', 'command', 'series', 'action', 'force', 'climb', 'beyond', 'capability', 'change', 'powermanagement', 'selector', 'maximum', 'continuous', 'thrust', 'switch', 'autopilot', 'verticalspeed', 'mode', 'climb', 'rate', 'even', 'though', 'mode', 'ban', 'ice', 'react', 'pilot', 'expect', 'increase', 'climb', 'rate', 'bid', 'break', 'cloud', 'accord', 'crew', 'statement', 'clear', 'cloud', 'layer', 'thought', 'climb', 'descend', 'best', 'option', 'escape', 'ice', 'say', 'inquiry', 'add', 'crew', 'completely', 'focus', 'objective', 'ignore', 'caution', 'ciaiac', 'point', 'although', 'officer', 'fly', 'pilot', 'captain', 'violate', 'task', 'assignment', 'carry', 'certain', 'activity', 'include', 'change', 'powermanagement', 'set', 'captain', 'much', 'experience', 'officer', 'probably', 'influence', 'officer', 'ability', 'oppose', 'decision', 'action', 'climb', 'inconsistent', 'procedure', 'recommendation', 'operator', 'atr', 'say', 'inquiry', 'though', 'initially', 'inconsequential', 'others', 'consequence', 'say', 'cockpitvoice', 'communication', 'available', 'investigation', 'flightdata', 'recorder', 'information', 'stall', 'captain', 'apply', 'noseup', 'input', 'course', 'suggest', 'seem', 'recognise', 'stall', 'appear', 'fixate', 'climb', 'officer', 'however', 'appear', 'identify', 'stall', 'make', 'nosedown', 'input', 'control', 'captain', 'make', 'input', 'opposite', 'direction', 'throttle', 'lever', 'move', 'maximumpower', 'position', 'despite', 'part', 'stallrecovery', 'procedure', 'require', 'extension', 'flap', 'carry', 'despite', 'event', 'person', 'passenger', 'sustain', 'minor', 'injury', 'incident', 'crew', 'recover', 'proceed', 'madrid', 'although', 'inquiry', 'highlight', 'atr', 'conduct', 'highspeed', 'unstable', 'approach', 'arrival']"
"Airbus has closed its sole final assembly line in China, as the novel coronavirus outbreak continues its spread in and out of the country. The airframer says the Tianjin final assembly line, which produces A320-family aircraft, is currently closed. Airbus did not say when it intended to reopen the facility. The Tianjin facility is one of four A320 final assembly lines around the world, and the only one in Asia. It began operations in 2008, and was the first final assembly line Airbus opened outside of Europe. Tianjin is also home to an A330 completion and delivery centre and a logistics centre, states Airbus. “With regards to the business impact, China domestic and worldwide travel restrictions are posing some logistical challenges,” says Airbus, without elaborating. Globally, a growing list of countries – such as Singapore, Australia and the United States – have imposed travel restrictions on individuals who have visited China recently. In China, several cities - such as Wuhan, where the outbreak is thought to have originated - are currently on lockdown in a bid to curb the spread of the virus. The airframer says it is monitoring the situation closely, and that its China unit is following government requirements for all staff to work from home, and is facilitating this with the necessary IT equipment. Airbus employs about 500 people in Tianjin. It adds: “Airbus is constantly evaluating the situation and monitoring any potential knock-on effects to production and deliveries and will try to mitigate via alternative plans where necessary.” Airbus's comment is the first response from a major airframer in recent days to the coronavirus outbreak, which has claimed close to 500 lives.

"Bombardier is discussing a potential sale of its business jet unit to Textron, according to reports, a move that if completed would catapult Textron into the large-cabin business jet segment and mark another divestiture by once-mighty Bombardier. TheWall Street Journalreported on 4 February that the companies have been discussing such a deal, which could enable Bombardier pay off some of its massive debt. Providence-based Textron declines to discuss the report, as does Montreal-based Bombardier. Both companies say they do not “comment on market rumors”. Having Bombardier's business jet unit under its wing would give Textron a line of aircraft – Globals – in the large-cabin, ultra-long-range segment. “We believe a potential acquisition of [Bombardier's aviation business] would make strategic sense for Textron as it would enable the company to gain access to the larger-cabin segment of the market with a strong family of products,” says a 4 February research note from Desjardins. The report adds that the more than 4,700 Bombardier business aircraft currently in service would give Textron a robust aftermarket business. Textron's Wichita-based Textron Aviation unit owns Cessna, which makes a range of aircraft, from light jets and turboprops to large business jets like the flagship Citation Longitude, which can carry 12 passengers and has 3,500nm (6,480km) range. Textron Aviation is also developing Denali, a single-engined turboprop, and a twin-turboprop utility aircraft called SkyCourier. Textron Aviation had tried to step-up its product offering with 12-passenger, 4,500nm-range Citation Hemisphere, but engine issues forced Textron to shelve that project in 2019. Bombardier is among the world's top producers of business jets. Its flagship line of Globals include the 5500, 6500 and 7500. The 7500 can carry 19 passengers, has 7,700nm range and top speed of Mach 0.925.  Bombardier's Global 7500 Globals compete with the likes of Gulfstream's G500, G600, G650ER and in-development G700, and with Dassault Aviation Falcons. Bombardier also manufactures the super-midsize Challenger 350 and large-jet Challenger 650, and owns Learjet, maker of Learjet 75 light jets. While Textron certainly sees value in Bombardier's larger aircraft, a takeover would make Learjet's future even more uncertain, says industry analyst Addison Schonland, partner at consultancy AirInsight Group Schonland questions whether Textron might shutter Learjet, which competes against Cessna Citations and, many analysts say, has suffered in recent years from lack of attention and investment. News of takeover talks follow Textron's announcement last year of 875 job cuts due partly to a restructuring of Textron Aviation and completion of Longitude certification. Textron Aviation's profit slipped 21% year-on-year to $134 million in the three months ending 4 January. Textron chief executive Scott Donnelly attributed the unit's difficult quarter partly to flat pricing. Textron anticipates Textron Aviation's revenue in the current fiscal year will be $5.4 billion, up about 4% from last fiscal year. Bombardier has struggled for several years – with much of the company's financial challenges stemming from the crippling development costs of CSeries. Bombardier handed Airbus majority ownership of that programme, now called the A220, in 2018. The Montreal company still owns 33% of the A220 programme but in January said it is reevaluating its ownership position. The CSeries divestiture set in motion a broader exit by Bombardier from commercial aviation. It has divested the Dash 8 turboprop line and agreed to sell its CRJ programme and various aerospace manufacturing and MRO sites. The company's executive have said the shift would enable it to focus on commercial aviation and its railcar business. Now the business aircraft unit seems to be on the table, and Bombardier has reportedly also been seeking a partner for its rail business. Bombardier releases its 2019 financial results on 13 February. But the company posted a $91 million net loss in the third quarter of 2019. In that period Bombardier's aviation business earned a profit before interest and taxes of $96 million, down 27% in one year, financial filings show. Bombardier had about $9.3 billion in long term debt as of 30 September 2019, including $1.5 billion due in 2021.",2,728,0.0,0.5419,"order, business, jet, delivery, production, customer, deliver, commercial, quarter, include","['bombardier', 'discuss', 'potential', 'sale', 'business', 'jet', 'unit', 'textron', 'accord', 'report', 'move', 'complete', 'catapult', 'textron', 'largecabin', 'business', 'jet', 'segment', 'mark', 'another', 'divestiture', 'oncemighty', 'bombardier', 'thewall', 'street', 'journalreported', 'february', 'discuss', 'deal', 'enable', 'bombardier', 'pay', 'massive', 'debt', 'providencebased', 'textron', 'decline', 'discus', 'report', 'montrealbased', 'bombardier', 'say', 'comment', 'market', 'rumor', 'bombardier', 'business', 'jet', 'unit', 'wing', 'give', 'textron', 'line', 'globals', 'largecabin', 'ultralongrange', 'segment', 'believe', 'potential', 'acquisition', 'bombardier', 'business', 'make', 'strategic', 'sense', 'textron', 'enable', 'gain', 'access', 'largercabin', 'segment', 'market', 'strong', 'family', 'product', 'say', 'february', 'research', 'note', 'desjardins', 'report', 'add', 'bombardier', 'business', 'currently', 'service', 'give', 'textron', 'robust', 'aftermarket', 'business', 'textron', 'wichitabased', 'textron', 'unit', 'cessna', 'make', 'range', 'light', 'jet', 'turboprop', 'large', 'business', 'jet', 'like', 'flagship', 'citation', 'longitude', 'carry', 'passenger', 'range', 'textron', 'develop', 'denali', 'singleengined', 'turboprop', 'twinturboprop', 'utility', 'call', 'skycourier', 'textron', 'try', 'stepup', 'product', 'offering', 'citation', 'hemisphere', 'engine', 'issue', 'force', 'textron', 'shelve', 'project', 'bombardier', 'among', 'world', 'top', 'producer', 'business', 'jet', 'flagship', 'line', 'globals', 'include', 'carry', 'passenger', 'range', 'top', 'speed', 'mach', 'bombardier', 'global', 'globals', 'compete', 'like', 'gulfstream', 'indevelopment', 'dassault', 'falcon', 'bombardier', 'manufacture', 'supermidsize', 'challenger', 'largejet', 'challenger', 'learjet', 'maker', 'learjet', 'light', 'jet', 'textron', 'certainly', 'see', 'value', 'bombardier', 'large', 'takeover', 'make', 'learjet', 'future', 'even', 'uncertain', 'say', 'industry', 'analyst', 'addison', 'schonland', 'partner', 'consultancy', 'airinsight', 'schonland', 'question', 'whether', 'textron', 'might', 'shutter', 'learjet', 'competes', 'cessna', 'citation', 'many', 'analyst', 'say', 'suffer', 'recent', 'lack', 'attention', 'investment', 'news', 'takeover', 'talk', 'follow', 'textron', 'announcement', 'job', 'cut', 'due', 'partly', 'restructuring', 'textron', 'completion', 'longitude', 'certification', 'textron', 'profit', 'slip', 'yearonyear', 'month', 'end', 'january', 'textron', 'chief', 'executive', 'scott', 'donnelly', 'attribute', 'unit', 'difficult', 'quarter', 'partly', 'flat', 'pricing', 'textron', 'anticipates', 'textron', 'revenue', 'current', 'fiscal', 'fiscal', 'bombardier', 'struggle', 'several', 'much', 'financial', 'challenge', 'stem', 'cripple', 'development', 'cost', 'cseries', 'bombardier', 'hand', 'majority', 'ownership', 'programme', 'call', 'montreal', 'still', 'programme', 'january', 'say', 'reevaluate', 'ownership', 'position', 'cseries', 'divestiture', 'set', 'motion', 'broader', 'exit', 'bombardier', 'commercial', 'divest', 'dash', 'turboprop', 'line', 'agree', 'sell', 'crj', 'programme', 'various', 'manufacturing', 'mro', 'site', 'executive', 'say', 'shift', 'enable', 'focus', 'commercial', 'railcar', 'business', 'business', 'unit', 'seem', 'table', 'bombardier', 'reportedly', 'seek', 'partner', 'rail', 'business', 'bombardier', 'release', 'financial', 'result', 'february', 'post', 'net', 'loss', 'third', 'quarter', 'period', 'bombardier', 'business', 'earn', 'profit', 'interest', 'tax', 'financial', 'filing', 'bombardier', 'long', 'term', 'debt', 'september', 'include', 'due']"
"The US Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) is soliciting potential contractors to integrate the Boeing P-8A Poseidon with Long Range Anti-Ship Missiles, as well as several other weapons. NAVAIR is also interested in outfitting the maritime patrol aircraft with 500lb to 2,000lb-class bombs fitted with Joint Direct Attack Munition guidance kits, Mk62/63/65 Quickstrike sea mines, Raytheon's gliding Small Diameter Bomb, as well as Miniature Air Launched Decoys, according to a notice posted online 28 January. To support the integration of weapons, NAVAIR is also soliciting information for installing the BRU-55 bomb rack and a Universal Armament Interface on the P-8A. “Engineering tasks for this effort includes, but are not limited to upgrades to the Boeing Tactical Open Mission Systems and Stores Management Computer software and interfaces, test planning, execution, data reduction, and reporting on flight test efforts,” says NAVAIR. “The contractor shall support the government in designing, modifying, installing, and maintaining the test aircraft and aircraft sub-system instrumentation.” The US Navy (USN) is asking for input from defence manufacturers to decide if it should create a bidding competition for the P-8A's weapons upgrade effort or just give the work to Boeing as a sole source award. The USN wants the upgrades done between 2021 and 2026. The P-8A is constructed from a 737-800 commercial airliner's airframe with -900 wings. The militarised aircraft has few passenger windows, its aluminium is twice as thick and its floor is strengthened with stiffeners. Because of that heft, the maritime aircraft can carry 126 sonobuoys internally, four Boeing AGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship missiles on hard points beneath its wing and Mk 54 lightweight hybrid torpedoes within an internal bomb bay. Those sensors and weapons are frequently used for submarine hunting. Some of the potential weapons imagined for the P-8A could likely be carried on existing wing hard points or within the internal bomb bay. Additional external capacity could come from BRU-55 bomb racks.

"Cathay Pacific and Cathay Dragon will cut 90% of its mainland China flights over the next two months, citing a “consequential significant drop” in market demand owing to the coronavirus outbreak. The two carriers add that there will be “significant reductions” across the rest of their respective networks for the same period. About 30% of capacity is expected to be cut, depending on market conditions, the carriers state. “These reductions are temporary for now and are driven by the commercial and operational realities at the current time, as well as projections in short-term demand,” Cathay adds. It stresses that its financial position “remains strong”. In late January, Cathay, along with other Hong Kong-based carriers, jointly announced they would be halving capacity into mainland China, in a bid by the Hong Kong government to stem the spread of the virus. The outbreak is believed to have begun in Wuhan, which has since been placed on an indefinite lockdown. Cathay's latest round of cuts comes months after it said it would be cutting seat capacity by 1.4% year-on-year for 2020.

"Cebu Pacific expects the coronavirus outbreak to impact its bottom line by up to Ps4 billion ($79 million). The low-cost carrier estimates that it will see “a Ps3-4 billion swing on profit” should the outbreak remain unabated over the next six months. It makes this estimate based on 2003's Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak, which curtailed demand for air travel for six months. The carrier has cancelled flights to China until 29 March, while reducing frequencies to Hong Kong and Macau. Meanwhile, compatriot Philippine Airlines and Philippines AirAsia have suspended flights to China, Hong Kong and Macau. Cebu Pacific stressed that the Ps4 billion figure is provided against “the context of its 2020 profit outlook,” especially since it posted operating profit of Ps8.9 billion in the first half of 2019. In its statement to the Philippines Stock Exchange, it confirmed remarks by its chief executive Lance Gokongwei that the impact of the coronavirus remains difficult to forecast as “the situation continues to evolve.” “We can't forecast because the situation is escalating so fast,” Gokongwei was quoted as saying in a 2 February report on The Philippine Star. “We just had an update regarding [the eruption of] Taal volcano three weeks ago and then now, there's a change in forecast.

"Russian investigators are probing a landing accident which damaged a Bombardier CRJ upon arrival at Tomsk on 3 February. The RusLine regional twinjet had been operating flight 7R823 from Ekaterinburg and landed in a crosswind of 4kt, according to meteorological data from Tomsk airport. Its nose-gear collapsed as it decelerated to a speed of around 80kt and came to a halt on the runway.

"The organiser of the Singapore air show has reaffirmed that the show will proceed as planned, amid concerns about the novel coronavirus outbreak. Experia Events notes that Singapore's Ministry of Health (MOH) presently rates the virus at DORSCON (Disease Outbreak Response System Condition) 'Yellow.' This means that while the disease is severe, it is spreading outside of Singapore. DORSCON Yellow is the country's second highest alert level below DORSCON Orange and its most severe alert level, DORSCON RED. The MOH website notes that no new confirmed cases of the virus were discovered on either the second or third of February. Of the 18 previously announced cases in the country, none are critically ill, with all cases in stable condition and most improving. “In addition to the current measures called out for at DORSCON yellow - enhanced cleaning and refuse management to maintain high standards of hygiene and cleanliness, availing hand sanitisers to attendees and a team of doctors and medics to attend to visitors who are feeling unwell - Experia Events will implement additional temperature screening at access points at Singapore Expo and [Changi Exhibition Centre],” says the company. Experia managing director Leck Chet Lam says that Experia regards the well-being of attendees as its highest priority, and will continue to take guidance from Singapore's MOH. Nonetheless, the show has seen some cancellations. Owing to Singapore's temporary ban of travellers who have been within China in the last two weeks, ten Chinese exhibitors have cancelled their attendance. In addition to the absence of Chinese companies, Experia says other companies have decided not to attend. It lists Bombardier, CAE, Gulfstream, Stemme, and Textron Aviation. The South Korean air force's display team, the Black Eagles, will also not appear. Though it will move forward with the main air show, Experia has cancelled the Singapore Airshow Aviation Leadership Summit, which was to take place on 10 February. It notes that airline leaders are preoccupied dealing with their response to the coronavirus, which has badly impacted air traffic in the region, particularly to and from China. “In the coming week, we are focused on delivering the show while ensuring the overall safety of our attendees. During this period, we will continue to work with the relevant authorities and do our utmost to offer support to our exhibitors, partners and visitors who require assistance,” says Leck.

"Bo Lingam has been appointed AirAsia Group's acting chief executive, after founders Tony Fernandes and Kamarudin Meranun stepped down temporarily to facilitate an independent probe into Airbus bribery allegations. Lingam is currently the group's president for airlines and will serve in the acting role for two months “or such other period that the company may deem fit,” says AirAsia Group in a Bursa Malaysia disclosure. Prior to that, Fernandes and Meranun announced on 3 February that they would step down from their roles as group chief executive and group chairman, also for two months. Airbus is being investigated for allegations of corruption over securing orders, and UK court documents list five counts of failing to prevent bribery, including one of activity linked to AirAsia. Court documents released after the UK Serious Fraud Office probe into Airbus detail allegations that two AirAsia executives – both “key decision makers” at AirAsia and long-haul operation AirAsia X– were “rewarded”, through a sports sponsorship, in respect of an order for 180 aircraft. The two executives were not identified in the court documents, and there is no indication that either Fernandes or Meranun is among the individuals referenced. The airline has vehemently denied any wrongdoing, and both Fernandes and Meranun have strongly reiterated this denial. Both men said in a 4 February statement: “At the request of the board of AirAsia, we have agreed to continue to assist AirAsia in an advisory capacity as and when required.” Back home, the Securities Commission of Malaysia (SCM) chairman Syed Zaid Albar said that it has launched investigations into the two AirAsia carriers “to determine if there is any breach of securities laws”.

"Colombian carrier Avianca has engaged a law firm to conduct an independent internal investigation into its relationship with Airbus, after the airline was linked to the extensive probe into alleged bribery involving the airframer. French authorities have disclosed that Airbus orders from airlines including Avianca, Air Arabia, Korean Air, China Airlines, and Nepal Airlines have been scrutinised as part of the probe into the manufacturer's alleged failure to prevent bribery. Airbus has agreed to pay a €3.6 billion fine to settle the case of which the majority, nearly €2.1 billion, has been imposed by the French judiciary – comprising a profit disgorgement of €1.05 billion and a penalty of €1.03 billion. The French statement of facts issued as part of the judicial public interest agreement by the Parquet National Financier lays out evidence to back its allegations. Its probe into the Avianca relationship focuses on the circumstances surrounding its order for 100 A320neo aircraft in 2015. Avianca says it has retained the law firm Ropes & Gray to carry out an internal investigation into its relationship with Airbus and whether it has been the “victim of wrongdoing”. The company adds that it will “fully collaborate” with relevant authorities. “Airbus's disclosure contains deeply concerning information regarding alleged actions by an individual at Avianca in the period prior to March 2016,” says Avianca Holdings president Anko van der Werff. “Our current management team strongly rejects any conduct that does not reflect integrity and transparency in business in general, and in particular towards Avianca.” The French documentation expresses suspicion over Airbus activity during a campaign for China Airlines, which ordered A350s in 2008. It refers to the airframer's contemplating “several legal and financial arrangements whose complexity and opacity were clearly intended to allow the transfer of funds in complete discretion”. The documentation also refers to evidence of “concealed compensation” in consideration of early A320 orders from United Arab Emirates budget carrier Air Arabia, as well as alleged payments which followed A330 orders from Korean Air in the late 1990s. Korean Air claims it “does not know” about the Airbus case. “We have not been questioned or informed of anything related to the investigation from the US, the UK, and the French government nor from Airbus,” says a spokesman for the carrier. Activity linked to a Nepal Airlines order for Airbus jets has similarly been highlighted. For each of the cases outlined, the Parquet National Financier says it “considers that these facts could constitute the offence of bribery”.

"Ryanair plans to purchase further Boeing 737 Max aircraft once the aircraft returns to service, in addition to taking delivery of the 210 it has already has on order or under option. “We are already in discussions with Boeing,” group chief executive Michael O'Leary said today during a conference call on third-quarter earnings. “We have an offer on the table for an order for new Max 10s, which is a 230-seat aircraft.” This would represent a change in variant from “Max 200s” – 200-seat Max 8s – that the low-cost carrier currently has on order. Once Boeing management is in a position to discuss new purchases, Ryanair expects “to be at the head of the queue”, says O'Leary. Discussions with Boeing about a repricing of the airline's existing Max order and reimbursement for costs and losses are continuing; Ryanair has meanwhile frozen pre-delivery payments. However, the issues cannot be resolved until the uncertainty surrounding the aircraft's return to service has cleared. Despite these difficulties, if you “look through the noise” the Max remains “a great aircraft”, argues O'Leary, noting that it provide the airline with 4% more seats than its Boeing 737NGs and a 16% fuel saving. Ryanair's senior pilots have flown the Max in simulators, giving him full confidence in the equipment. “It handles brilliantly and customers are going to love it,” he asserts. Because Ryanair is focused solely on its operations during the busy summer months, the airline has put off taking delivery of any new Max jets until winter 2020, after “hopefully” seeing the aircraft return to the skies with other airlines by June. Because of the complexities and potential disruption from taking delivery of large numbers of aircraft, Ryanair does not expect to receive more than eight Max jets in any single month and will have no more than 50 of the aircraft, in total, for the next summer peak. However, the Max's entry into service will be helped by the fact that Ryanair owns a couple of flight simulators, O'Leary points out. Boeing recently updated its guidance and now recommends that simulator training take place to enable 737NG pilots to operate the 737 Max. Ryanair had originally been due to receive its first Max 8 in April 2019, and the absence of the aircraft from its schedules has had a significant impact on its operational performance. For full-year 2021 it expects to carry around 156 million passengers, down from 162 million without the Max issue. This will push the airline's target of flying 200 million passengers back a year to 2025 or 2026. O'Leary notes that seven bases have already been closed across Europe because of a lack of aircraft capacity amid aircraft delays. When asked whether further bases could be closed, Ryanair group finance chief Neil Sorahan responds: “It can never be ruled out.” The carrier made a pre-tax profit of €82 million ($91 million) in the quarter ended 31 December 2019, compared with a loss of €84 million in the same period of 2018.

"Ghana's president is to pursue an inquiry into allegations of bribery during the military's acquisition of Airbus tactical transport aircraft, detailed in UK court documents following a corruption probe into the airframer. Five counts of failing to prevent bribery, aimed at Airbus after a UK Serious Fraud Office investigation, mainly centre on activities relating to commercial aircraft orders in the Asia-Pacific region. But one count focuses on two campaigns to supply Airbus Military C295s to Ghana. Two aircraft were ordered in August 2011 and a third, after an aborted lease proposal, in March 2015. It alleges that Airbus engaged a close relative of a high-ranking elected Ghanaian government official as a business partner for the proposed C295 sale, and that this relationship was known within Airbus. Commission payments of around €5 million – intended to reward improper favour – were made, or promised, to the business partner, according to a UK High Court statement on the case disclosed on 31 January. “False documentation was created by, or with the agreement of, Airbus employees in order to support and disguise these payments,” it adds. Ghanaian president Nana Akufo-Addo has “taken notice” of the details of the deferred prosecution agreement with Airbus and the “implications”, says the country's communications directorate. It has not disclosed the identity of the senior Ghanaian government official highlighted by the court as a key decision-maker in respect of the aircraft sales. But the president has referred the situation to the special prosecutor's office with instructions to collaborate with UK authorities and conduct a “prompt inquiry”.

"Taiwan's Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) has revoked the operating licence of now-shuttered Far Eastern Air Transport (FAT). FAT went belly up on 13 December, owing to “long-term operating losses” and difficulty in raising sufficient funds. The carrier made the abrupt announcement it was ceasing operations a day earlier, in an apparent flouting of Taiwan's civil aviation laws, which state that there should be a 60-day buffer period between announcement and actual ceasing of operations. As a result, the MOTC has revoked FAT's licence effective 31 January, and impose a NT$3 million ($99,000) fine. FAT's existing slots will also be redistributed among other Taiwanese carriers, the ministry adds. Cirium schedules data shows that as of November last year, it operated 83 regional flights to various cities in China, Japan and South Korea, as well as Da Nang in Vietnam. FAT also operated a number of domestic services. In the month or so since it closed, the ministry also notes that FAT's employees were not paid their December salaries. It will also “work with relevant ministries” to ensure that consumer and employee rights were protected, as a result of FAT's sudden closure. Privately-owned FAT's abrupt closure comes amid a checkered operating history. The carrier ceased operations in 2008 after entering bankruptcy and returned to service in April 2011. It eventually emerged from a seven-year bankruptcy process in October 2015, though restructuring plans that involved leasing in 20 Boeing 737-800s were not realised. Cirium fleets data indicates that at the time it wound up, FAT had 12 aircraft in its in-service fleet, comprising of six ATR 72-600s, four Boeing MD-82s, and two MD-83s.

"Japan Airlines (JAL) posted a 20% decline in third-quarter operating profit, on the back of lower revenue from the international passenger and cargo segments. Operating profit for the three months ended 31 December 2019 came in at Y38.8 billion ($357 million), the carrier states in an investor presentation. Domestic passenger revenue was largely stable, gaining 1.5% to Y139 billion, but this was offset by a 6.1% decline in international passenger revenue to Y126 billion. Cargo revenue plunged 12.8% to Y23.9 billion. Expenses were flat at Y332 billion, with higher aircraft maintenance and accounting costs offsetting the decline in fuel costs. Net profit for the quarter was down by 24.4% to Y25.1 billion. On a nine-month basis, operating profit fell 17.4% to Y120 billion. Revenue was flat at Y1.13 trillion, while expenses gained 2.6% to Y1.01 trillion. Net profit declined by 28.4% to Y76.3 billion. As of 31 December 2019, JAL's cash and cash equivalents stood at Y296 billion, down from the Y462 billion at 31 March 2019, at the end of the previous fiscal year. JAL notes that domestic passenger demand held up but international passenger demand was “not very strong” due to the global economic trends, oversupply of capacity on flights to China and Europe, as well as declining demand to Hong Kong and South Korea. Overseas cargo demand was also “slack globally”. As a result, the Oneworld member has revised its earnings forecast for the fiscal year ending 31 March.

"Jeju Air has delayed acquiring a majority stake in compatriot Eastar Jet by yet another month, again citing the due diligence process. “There are no issues with the process [and the delay] is just about the shortage of time. We expect to close the deal in February,” Jeju tells Cirium. It announced on 18 December that it would acquire a 51% stake in the smaller Eastar for W69.5 billion ($58 million). The carriers signed a memorandum of understanding on 26 December and expected to seal a contract by year-end. At the end of December, Jeju announced that the expected completion of the stock sale and purchase contract was pushed back from 9 January to the end of January. It now expects this to close by the end of February. To fund the acquisition of 4.9 million Eastar shares, Jeju is issuing a W10 billion convertible bond that offers nearly 1.5% of its own share capital at maturity, with a five-year tenor and bearing 1% coupon.

"Airbus analysis estimated that the damage impact from a criminal conviction arising from bribery charges levelled against the company could have reached €200 billion across its commercial aircraft, defence and helicopter divisions. The airframer has agreed to pay a €3.6 billion ($4 billion) fine to settle the case under a three-year deferred prosecution arrangement, a deal intended to avoid a costly fraud trial and potential collateral damage affecting the workforce. Airbus stood accused of failing to prevent bribery in a number of countries following an extensive investigation. The probe covered over 1,750 entities which were engaged by Airbus as business partners, third parties used to increase the airframer's international reach and assist in winning sales contracts. Of these, 110 were the subject of particular concerns. Conviction could have resulted in discretionary – and, in some states, mandatory – debarment from tendering for public-sector contracts. “What matters here is not the potential loss of contracts...but the effect this will have on the company financially and on its [innocent] employees, and the wider effects this will have on innocent third parties,” remarked the president of the UK High Court's Queen's Bench Division, Dame Victoria Sharp, regarding the case. Airbus had examined the value of contracts for which it could be banned from tendering if debarred, the effects of which could last up to 15 years. This analysis showed that, in the worst case, the total future revenue at risk could exceed €200 billion. Such an extensive financial impact would have put thousands of jobs at risk – at the airframer and its suppliers – across the 15-year timeframe, and would have affected Airbus substantially in terms of market presence given its position as one of the two players in a global commercial aircraft duopoly. Financial firm Deloitte estimates, in a study commissioned by Airbus, that the indirect impact on the economies of countries including France, Germany, the UK, Spain and the USA could adversely affect their GDP by over €100 billion, said Sharp. The reduction in competition from Airbus's absence in public tenders, she added, could also result in additional public spending amounting to “many billions” of euros. “Notwithstanding the seriousness of the conduct in this case, I consider the public interest factors against prosecution clearly outweigh those tending in favour of prosecution,” Sharp said. She referred to Airbus's “exemplary” co-operation in the matter, noting its voluntary submission to the UK Serious Fraud Office regarding overseas conduct and highlighting 24 individual areas in which it subsequently provided full assistance to the subsequent investigation – a factor which helped to halve the penalty portion of the UK fine to €398 million, resulting in a total sanction of €991 million. This co-operation included providing access to over 30 million documents relevant to the probe. Independent investigation did not identify any additional documents not already brought up by Airbus's own efforts. “Airbus has, to use a colloquial phrase, truly turned out its pockets and is now a changed company to that which existed when the wrongdoing occurred,” added Sharp.",2,742,10.0,0.3541,"international, authority, civil, state, investigation, case, add, january, airasia, crash","['analysis', 'estimate', 'damage', 'impact', 'criminal', 'conviction', 'arise', 'bribery', 'charge', 'level', 'reach', 'across', 'commercial', 'defence', 'helicopter', 'division', 'airframer', 'agree', 'pay', 'fine', 'settle', 'case', 'threeyear', 'defer', 'prosecution', 'arrangement', 'deal', 'intend', 'avoid', 'costly', 'fraud', 'trial', 'potential', 'collateral', 'damage', 'affect', 'workforce', 'stood', 'accuse', 'fail', 'prevent', 'bribery', 'number', 'country', 'follow', 'extensive', 'investigation', 'probe', 'cover', 'entity', 'engage', 'business', 'partner', 'third', 'party', 'use', 'increase', 'airframer', 'international', 'reach', 'assist', 'win', 'sale', 'contract', 'subject', 'particular', 'concern', 'conviction', 'result', 'discretionary', 'state', 'mandatory', 'debarment', 'tender', 'publicsector', 'contract', 'matter', 'potential', 'loss', 'contract', 'effect', 'financially', 'innocent', 'employee', 'wider', 'effect', 'innocent', 'third', 'party', 'remark', 'president', 'uk', 'high', 'court', 'queen', 'bench', 'division', 'dame', 'victoria', 'sharp', 'regard', 'case', 'examine', 'value', 'contract', 'ban', 'tender', 'debar', 'effect', 'analysis', 'bad', 'case', 'total', 'future', 'revenue', 'risk', 'exceed', 'extensive', 'financial', 'impact', 'put', 'thousand', 'job', 'risk', 'airframer', 'supplier', 'across', 'timeframe', 'affected', 'substantially', 'term', 'market', 'presence', 'give', 'position', 'player', 'global', 'commercial', 'duopoly', 'financial', 'firm', 'deloitte', 'estimate', 'study', 'commission', 'indirect', 'impact', 'economy', 'country', 'include', 'france', 'germany', 'uk', 'spain', 'usa', 'adversely', 'affect', 'gdp', 'say', 'sharp', 'reduction', 'competition', 'absence', 'public', 'tender', 'add', 'result', 'additional', 'public', 'spending', 'amount', 'many', 'euro', 'notwithstanding', 'seriousness', 'conduct', 'case', 'consider', 'public', 'interest', 'factor', 'prosecution', 'clearly', 'outweigh', 'tend', 'favour', 'prosecution', 'sharp', 'say', 'refer', 'exemplary', 'cooperation', 'matter', 'note', 'voluntary', 'submission', 'uk', 'serious', 'fraud', 'office', 'regard', 'overseas', 'conduct', 'highlight', 'individual', 'area', 'subsequently', 'provide', 'full', 'assistance', 'subsequent', 'investigation', 'factor', 'help', 'halve', 'penalty', 'portion', 'uk', 'fine', 'result', 'total', 'sanction', 'cooperation', 'include', 'provide', 'access', 'document', 'relevant', 'probe', 'independent', 'investigation', 'identify', 'additional', 'document', 'already', 'brought', 'effort', 'use', 'colloquial', 'phrase', 'truly', 'turn', 'pocket', 'change', 'exist', 'wrongdoing', 'occur', 'add', 'sharp']"
"Airlines in China have begun cancelling flights to a growing list of international destinations, in light of travel restrictions imposed following a novel coronavirus outbreak. As the number of confirmed cases in China and around the world continues to climb, countries like Singapore, Vietnam, the Philippines and the United States are denying entry to foreign nationals who have recently been in China. Air China, in a 2 February service notice on its website, states that it will be cancelling all flights between Mainland China and Singapore, Vietnam and Australia. Through February, Air China will suspend its twice-daily flights between Beijing Capital and Singapore, as well as its four times weekly service to Chengdu. During the same period, the Star Alliance carrier will cancelling its daily Beijing Capital-Melbourne and Beijing Capital-Sydney flights. From 3 February to 28 March, its thrice-weekly Chengdu-Sydney flights will be suspended. As for flights to Vietnam, Air China states it is suspending all flights effective 2 February until the end of March. The four routes affected are: Beijing Capital-Ho Chi Minh City, Beijing Capital-Hanoi, Hangzhou-Nha Trang, as well as Chongqing-Nha Trang. Air China's latest round of cancellations comes a day after it suspended all flights to Italy and Mongolia. China Eastern and China Southern have not publicly announced capacity cuts, but checks on the respective carriers' websites indicates it has quietly cancelled flights, mostly to countries which have imposed travel restrictions, such as Singapore and Italy. Juneyao Air, meanwhile, has cancelled flights from its Shanghai Pudong hub to Taipei, Bangkok, Macau, as well as Singapore. These cancellations took effect 1 and 2 February, the airline states. Chinese low-cost carrier Spring Airlines has suspended flights to several points in its network, such as Osaka Kansai, Phnom Penh, Singapore, Bangkok and Seoul Incheon. In recent days, a growing number of airlines have cancelled flights into China, in a bid to curb the spread of the coronavirus. Major carriers like the Lufthansa Group, Singapore Airlines Group, British Airways, United Airlines and American Airlines have either entirely stopped flying into China, or have cut capacity into the country. The World Health Organisation (WHO) on 30 January declared the coronavirus outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. Chinese state media reported on 2 February that the number of confirmed cases in the country has hit 14,000, with the death toll rising above 300. Most of the deaths occurred in Hubei province, which is the epicentre of the outbreak. The Philippines also reported its first death from the coronavirus outbreak outside of China.

"Low-cost carrier AirAsia has vehemently denied any allegations of wrongdoing after Airbus was heavily fined under a deferred prosecution arrangement over multiple charges relating to alleged failure to stop bribery. Malaysia's Anti-Corruption Commission says it is “already investigating the matter” and is “in touch” with UK authorities. The charges against Airbus include accusations that it failed to prevent bribery intended to reward AirAsia executives in respect of orders for 180 aircraft. The indictment presented by the UK's Serious Fraud Office alleges that Airbus paid $50 million in sponsorship for a sports team, despite there being no legal relationship between the team and AirAsia, and offered to pay another $55 million – a transfer which was never made, because heightened scrutiny led to a payment freeze. But AirAsia says it “vigorously rejects” any suggestion of wrongdoing, insisting that each aircraft purchase was made not by any single decision but took into account technical, economic and performance considerations, and ultimately emerged from a process of “careful evaluation, deliberation and the collective decision of the board members”. “Superiority and reliability of the aircraft and increasingly attractive pricing being offered to maintain our competitive edge in the airline business were key considerations,” it adds. “AirAsia never made purchase decisions that were premised on an Airbus sponsorship.” The airline says its negotiations over the aircraft purchase were undertaken directly with Airbus on an “arm's length basis” without involvement of any third parties or intermediaries. “AirAsia executives negotiated rigorously in the interests of the company and had at all times acted in good faith,” it states, adding that it cannot be associated with any alleged lapses of compliance within Airbus. The airline stresses that it will “fully co-operate” with the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission and other authorities when required. It states that it was not involved in the UK Serious Fraud Office probe and claims it was not given any opportunity to provide information or clarification to the organisation. “AirAsia is deeply concerned that these allegations will have an adverse and negative impact on the AirAsia brand, reputation and goodwill,” it adds.

"All Nippon Airways (ANA) has placed its first orders for the A321neo Airbus Cabin Flex (ACF) version, which it will take as the A321LR extended range variant. The decision is significant as the airline had previously retained its contract for the original A321neo cabin configuration. The A321LR order has been placed by parent company ANA Holdings through a swap of two existing A320neo orders. The A321LRs will be delivered in FY 2022 and 2023. ANA was launch operator for the Pratt & Whitney PW1100G-powered A321neo (or A321-200N), taking its first in September 2017. It now operates a fleet of 11 A321neos, all of which are built to the A321 original door configuration, with four cabin doors on each side. The airline had a further 11 A321neos on backlog prior to the A321LR announcement, according to Cirium fleets data. ANA has continued to take this original A321neo layout to retain fleet commonality, despite the introduction of the improved ACF version in July 2018. The ACF variant, dubbed “A321-200NX”, has three cabin doors per side and up to two over-wing emergency exits, with the option to deactivate some doors/exits, depending on cabin layout. The door options along with cabin changes allow capacity to rise from the original maximum of 220 seats to up to 240. The -200NX is the platform from which the A321LR is derived by way of auxiliary fuel tanks in the cargo hold. Airbus is currently building a multitude of A321 variants, including the original A321ceo (-200), the A321neo (-200N) and the A321neo ACF (-200NX). This means that Airbus is also still producing three different engine options – the CFM International CFM56 on the A321ceo along with the CFM Leap-1A and Pratt & Whitney PW1100G on all the A321neo versions. Production of all International Aero Engines V2500-powered A320 family versions ended last year, with the last V2500-powered delivery being an A321-200 to Wizz Air in August, according to Cirium data. This mix of variants, combined with the volume of new “heads of version” (ie each customer cabin specification), has been a key cause of the production delays Airbus has suffered with its largest single-aisle product. Airbus had 38 A321ceos on backlog by at the beginning of 2020 and should wrap up production of the old variant next year. However, with orders for over 400 of the initial A321neo -200N variant remaining, according to Cirium data, it will need to continue building both door options unless it can convince more customers to switch of the -200NX ACF configuration. Meanwhile Airbus will begin producing another iteration of A321neo from 2023, the XLR variant. Officially dubbed the A321-200NY but marketed as the A321XLR, this variant combines the existing A321-200NX ACF cabin arrangement with major changes, including to the wing trailing-edge and fuel system.

"Iran Air is playing down an incident involving one of its Airbus A319s which ran into rough ground after landing at Kermanshah early on 1 February. The airline states that the aircraft – arriving as flight IR283 from Tehran Mehrabad at about 06:00 – did not veer off the runway, but says its nose-wheel travelled onto grass as the aircraft vacated. Iran Air attributes the incident to visibility being “reduced to a minimum” from a blizzard. Meteorological data from Kermanshah shows the visual range for runway 29 at 06:00 was down to 300m, with fog and snow showers. Video images circulating on social media, purporting to show the immediate aftermath, indicate passengers disembarked the A319 via airstairs. While there is no indication of serious damage, Iran Air says the twinjet will be inspected by engineers and undergo any necessary repairs. Cirium fleets data lists the aircraft involved (EP-IEQ) as a 2002 airframe powered by CFM International CFM56 engines, originally delivered to Air China and subsequently operated by carriers including Rossiya. It was one of three A319s of similar origin which were acquired as a batch by Iran Air last year.",2,746,7.0,0.2971,"crew, runway, inquiry, land, approach, accident, investigator, captain, incident, pilot","['iran', 'play', 'incident', 'involve', 'ran', 'rough', 'ground', 'land', 'kermanshah', 'early', 'february', 'state', 'arrive', 'tehran', 'mehrabad', 'veer', 'runway', 'say', 'nosewheel', 'travel', 'onto', 'grass', 'vacate', 'iran', 'attribute', 'incident', 'visibility', 'reduce', 'minimum', 'blizzard', 'meteorological', 'data', 'kermanshah', 'visual', 'range', 'runway', 'fog', 'snow', 'shower', 'video', 'image', 'circulate', 'social', 'medium', 'purport', 'immediate', 'aftermath', 'indicate', 'passenger', 'disembarked', 'via', 'airstairs', 'indication', 'serious', 'damage', 'iran', 'say', 'twinjet', 'inspect', 'engineer', 'undergo', 'necessary', 'repair', 'fleet', 'data', 'list', 'involve', 'epieq', 'airframe', 'power', 'cfm', 'international', 'engine', 'originally', 'deliver', 'subsequently', 'operate', 'carrier', 'include', 'rossiya', 'similar', 'origin', 'acquire', 'batch', 'iran']"
"Judicial authorities overseeing a deferred prosecution arrangement with Airbus have described as “endemic” the bribery linked to its commercial aircraft and defence divisions, as details emerged of activities scrutinised by fraud investigators. Airbus has agreed to pay a €3.6 billion fine to settle multiple investigations from French, UK and US authorities. While a French arrangement covers the largest part of the fine, over €2 billion, court approval of the UK portion of the settlement, over €990 million, has been accompanied by an agreed statement of facts about the alleged offences of failure to prevent bribery. Sponsorship payments to a sports team owned by AirAsia executives, but unrelated to either AirAsia or AirAsia X, were “intended to secure or reward improper favour” for orders covering 180 aircraft, the court document states. The orders included the AirAsia deal for 55 Airbus A330neos unveiled in 2014 plus earlier agreements for 25 A330s, 64 A320neos and 36 A320s. SriLankan Airlines' acquisition of six A330s and four A350s has been tied to a $16.8 million payment offer to an airline executive's wife, through a company which was then approved by Airbus as a business partner, to influence the purchase. The wife's identity was disguised, the court document says, to mislead a UK export credit agency. Similar payments were made to executives at Garuda Indonesia, its low-cost division Citilink, and TransAsia Airways' parent intended to “reward improper favour”, the document adds. The Garuda orders associated with the agreed wrongdoing cover 15 A330s and 40 A320s, while the TransAsia orders included two A330s and 18 A321neo and A321 jets. Bizarre communications between Airbus and an intermediary regarding TransAsia took the form of “coded e-mails”, the court document reveals, which referred to participants through aliases – notably discussing “medications and dosages” prescribed by a 'doctor' to the 'patient' with numbers which actually represented payments from Airbus to the intermediary and onwards to a TransAsia parent executive. AirAsia, SriLankan Airlines and Garuda could not immediately be reached for comment. TransAsia Airways ceased operations in 2016. The court document also details Airbus's making or promising payments, disguised by false papers, in relation to a proposal to sell three Airbus Military C295s. An indictment charging Airbus with five counts of failure to bribery in these cases was laid at London's High Court on 31 January, but suspended at the request of the UK's Serious Fraud Office following Airbus's entering a deferred prosecution agreement. In her judgement, the president of the Queen's Bench Division of the High Court, Dame Victoria Sharp, says the “scale and scope of the wrongdoing” outlined in the court document “demonstrate that bribery was, to the extent indicated, endemic in two core business areas within Airbus”. “Airbus paid bribes through agents around the world to stack the decks in its favour and win contracts around the globe,” says Serious Fraud Office director Lisa Osofsky. But she credits the airframer with admitting culpability and taking steps to overhaul its compliance measures. Airbus board chairman Denis Ranque insists the settlements “turn the page on unacceptable business practices from the past”, adding: ”Strengthening of our compliance programmes at Airbus is designed to ensure that such misconduct cannot happen again.” The €991 million sanction in the UK case comprises a disgorgement of profit totalling nearly €586 million and a penalty of €398 million. Details of the findings of the related French investigations, which contributed to the overall €3.6 billion settlement, have yet to be disclosed. The US portion of the settlement totals €526 million. The US Department of Justice states that Airbus offered to pay bribes to foreign individuals, including Chinese officials, in order to obtain and retain business “including contracts to sell aircraft”. Assistant attorney general Brian Benczkowski says the scheme was “multi-year and massive” and designed to “corruptly enhance” Airbus's business interests.",2,747,10.0,0.4878,"international, authority, civil, state, investigation, case, add, january, airasia, crash","['judicial', 'authority', 'oversee', 'defer', 'prosecution', 'arrangement', 'described', 'endemic', 'bribery', 'link', 'commercial', 'defence', 'division', 'detail', 'emerge', 'activity', 'scrutinise', 'fraud', 'investigator', 'agree', 'pay', 'fine', 'settle', 'multiple', 'investigation', 'french', 'uk', 'u', 'authority', 'french', 'arrangement', 'cover', 'large', 'part', 'fine', 'court', 'approval', 'uk', 'portion', 'settlement', 'accompany', 'agree', 'statement', 'fact', 'allege', 'offence', 'failure', 'prevent', 'bribery', 'sponsorship', 'payment', 'sport', 'team', 'airasia', 'executive', 'unrelated', 'either', 'airasia', 'airasia', 'x', 'intend', 'secure', 'reward', 'improper', 'favour', 'order', 'cover', 'court', 'document', 'state', 'order', 'include', 'airasia', 'deal', 'unveiled', 'plus', 'earlier', 'agreement', 'srilankan', 'acquisition', 'tie', 'payment', 'offer', 'executive', 'wife', 'approve', 'business', 'partner', 'influence', 'purchase', 'wife', 'identity', 'disguise', 'court', 'document', 'say', 'mislead', 'uk', 'export', 'credit', 'agency', 'similar', 'payment', 'make', 'executive', 'garuda', 'indonesia', 'lowcost', 'division', 'citilink', 'transasia', 'airway', 'parent', 'intend', 'reward', 'improper', 'favour', 'document', 'add', 'garuda', 'order', 'associate', 'agree', 'wrongdoing', 'cover', 'transasia', 'order', 'include', 'jet', 'bizarre', 'communication', 'intermediary', 'regard', 'transasia', 'take', 'form', 'cod', 'email', 'court', 'document', 'reveals', 'refer', 'participant', 'alias', 'notably', 'discuss', 'medication', 'dosage', 'prescribed', 'number', 'actually', 'represent', 'payment', 'intermediary', 'onwards', 'transasia', 'parent', 'executive', 'airasia', 'srilankan', 'garuda', 'immediately', 'reach', 'comment', 'transasia', 'airway', 'cease', 'operation', 'court', 'document', 'detail', 'make', 'promising', 'payment', 'disguise', 'false', 'paper', 'relation', 'proposal', 'sell', 'military', 'indictment', 'charge', 'count', 'failure', 'bribery', 'case', 'laid', 'london', 'high', 'court', 'january', 'suspend', 'request', 'uk', 'serious', 'fraud', 'office', 'follow', 'enter', 'defer', 'prosecution', 'agreement', 'judgement', 'president', 'queen', 'bench', 'division', 'high', 'court', 'dame', 'victoria', 'sharp', 'say', 'scale', 'scope', 'wrongdoing', 'outline', 'court', 'document', 'demonstrate', 'bribery', 'extent', 'indicate', 'endemic', 'core', 'business', 'area', 'within', 'paid', 'bribe', 'agent', 'around', 'world', 'stack', 'deck', 'favour', 'win', 'contract', 'around', 'globe', 'say', 'serious', 'fraud', 'office', 'director', 'lisa', 'osofsky', 'credit', 'airframer', 'admit', 'culpability', 'take', 'step', 'overhaul', 'compliance', 'measure', 'board', 'chairman', 'denis', 'ranque', 'insists', 'settlement', 'turn', 'page', 'unacceptable', 'business', 'practice', 'past', 'add', 'strengthen', 'compliance', 'programme', 'design', 'ensure', 'misconduct', 'happen', 'sanction', 'uk', 'case', 'comprises', 'disgorgement', 'profit', 'total', 'nearly', 'penalty', 'detail', 'finding', 'related', 'french', 'investigation', 'contribute', 'overall', 'settlement', 'yet', 'disclose', 'u', 'portion', 'settlement', 'total', 'u', 'department', 'justice', 'state', 'offer', 'pay', 'bribe', 'foreign', 'individual', 'include', 'chinese', 'official', 'order', 'obtain', 'retain', 'business', 'include', 'contract', 'sell', 'assistant', 'attorney', 'general', 'brian', 'benczkowski', 'say', 'scheme', 'multiyear', 'massive', 'design', 'corruptly', 'enhance', 'business', 'interest']"
"The Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II has 873 unresolved deficiencies and new problems are being discovered regularly, making reducing the number of issues with the aircraft difficult. That's the conclusion of the latest scathing assessment of the stealth fighter from the Annual Report for the US Department of Defense's (DoD) Office of the Director of Operational Test & Evaluation (DOT&E), released to the US Congress on 30 January. “Although the programme is working to fix deficiencies, new discoveries are still being made, resulting in only a minor decrease in the overall number of deficiencies,” says the report. The F-35's problems include 13 Category 1 deficiencies. Such problems “may cause death or severe injury; may cause loss or major damage to a weapon system; critically restricts the combat readiness capabilities of the using organisation; or results in a production line stoppage,” according to the US Air Force's (USAF) definition. The F-35's deficiencies are compounded by maintenance problems which hobbled the aircraft's mission capable rate below the DoD's goal of 80%. The mission capable rate is the percentage of aircraft capable of performing at least one mission, excluding aircraft in depot maintenance or undergoing major repairs. “No significant portion of the fleet, including the combat-coded fleet, was able to achieve and sustain the DoD mission capable rate goal of 80%,” says the DOT&E. “However, individual units have been able to achieve the 80% target for short periods during deployed operations.” Lockheed Martin did not respond to questions about when deficiencies with the F-35 would be fixed, saying it is still reviewing the DOT&E report. “The F-35 continues to mature and is the most lethal, survivable and connected fighter in the world,” the company says. “Reliability continues to improve, with the global fleet averaging greater than 65% mission capable rates and operational units consistently performing near 75%.” Some of the aircraft's lingering problems appear to be connected to the F-35 Joint Program Office and Lockheed Martin's recently adopted Continuous Capability Development and Delivery process, a method of delivering software fixes and additional functions every six months. The process is modeled on a Silicon Valley method of delivering bite-sized chunks of code changes to customers called agile software development. Lockheed Martin was openly optimistic in 2019 about the agile method's ability to turn around the F-35's troublesome software, which totals more than 8 million lines of code. However, DOT&E says the concept has been problematic. “Software changes, intended to introduce new capabilities or fix deficiencies, often introduced stability problems and adversely affected other functionality,” says the weapons evaluator's report. “Due to these inefficiencies, along with a large amount of planned new capabilities, DOT&E considers the program's current Revision 13 master schedule to be high risk.” Hardware problems persist too. For example, USAF “units flying newer F-35A aircraft discovered cracks in the outer mold-line coatings and the underlying chine longeron skin, near the gun muzzle, after aircraft returned from flights when the gun was employed”, according to the report. The F-35A's internally mounted 25mm gun also remains inaccurate. “Investigations into the gun mounts of the F-35A revealed misalignments that result in muzzle alignment errors,” says DOT&E. “As a result, the true alignment of each F-35A gun is not known, so the programme is considering options to re-boresight and correct gun alignments.” It is not known if those changes will fix the aircraft's problems, as further testing would be needed, notes the Pentagon. The US Marine Corps' F-35B and the US Navy's F-35C, which carry 25mm guns in external pods, were accurate in air-to-ground firing tests, the report says.",2,748,1.0,0.4601,"test, force, helicopter, fire, system, service, attack, design, usaf, missile","['lockheed', 'martin', 'lightning', 'ii', 'unresolved', 'deficiency', 'problem', 'discover', 'regularly', 'make', 'reduce', 'number', 'issue', 'difficult', 'conclusion', 'late', 'scathing', 'assessment', 'stealth', 'fighter', 'annual', 'report', 'u', 'department', 'defense', 'dod', 'office', 'director', 'operational', 'test', 'evaluation', 'dot', 'e', 'release', 'u', 'congress', 'january', 'although', 'programme', 'work', 'fix', 'deficiency', 'discovery', 'still', 'make', 'result', 'minor', 'decrease', 'overall', 'number', 'deficiency', 'say', 'report', 'problem', 'include', 'category', 'deficiency', 'problem', 'may', 'cause', 'death', 'severe', 'injury', 'may', 'cause', 'loss', 'major', 'damage', 'weapon', 'system', 'critically', 'restricts', 'combat', 'readiness', 'capability', 'use', 'organisation', 'result', 'production', 'line', 'stoppage', 'accord', 'u', 'force', 'usaf', 'definition', 'deficiency', 'compound', 'maintenance', 'problem', 'hobble', 'mission', 'capable', 'rate', 'dod', 'goal', 'mission', 'capable', 'rate', 'percentage', 'capable', 'perform', 'least', 'mission', 'exclude', 'depot', 'maintenance', 'undergo', 'major', 'repair', 'significant', 'portion', 'fleet', 'include', 'combatcoded', 'fleet', 'able', 'achieve', 'sustain', 'dod', 'mission', 'capable', 'rate', 'goal', 'say', 'dot', 'e', 'however', 'individual', 'unit', 'able', 'achieve', 'target', 'short', 'period', 'deployed', 'lockheed', 'martin', 'respond', 'question', 'deficiency', 'fix', 'say', 'still', 'review', 'dot', 'e', 'report', 'continue', 'mature', 'lethal', 'survivable', 'connect', 'fighter', 'world', 'say', 'reliability', 'continue', 'improve', 'global', 'fleet', 'average', 'great', 'mission', 'capable', 'rate', 'operational', 'unit', 'consistently', 'perform', 'near', 'linger', 'problem', 'appear', 'connect', 'joint', 'program', 'office', 'lockheed', 'martin', 'recently', 'adopt', 'continuous', 'capability', 'development', 'delivery', 'process', 'method', 'deliver', 'software', 'fix', 'additional', 'function', 'every', 'month', 'process', 'model', 'silicon', 'valley', 'method', 'deliver', 'bitesized', 'chunk', 'code', 'change', 'customer', 'call', 'agile', 'software', 'development', 'lockheed', 'martin', 'openly', 'optimistic', 'agile', 'method', 'ability', 'turn', 'around', 'troublesome', 'software', 'total', 'line', 'code', 'however', 'dot', 'e', 'say', 'concept', 'problematic', 'software', 'change', 'intend', 'introduce', 'capability', 'fix', 'deficiency', 'often', 'introduce', 'stability', 'problem', 'adversely', 'affected', 'functionality', 'say', 'weapon', 'evaluator', 'report', 'due', 'inefficiency', 'along', 'large', 'amount', 'plan', 'capability', 'dot', 'e', 'considers', 'program', 'current', 'revision', 'master', 'schedule', 'high', 'hardware', 'problem', 'persist', 'example', 'usaf', 'unit', 'fly', 'newer', 'discover', 'crack', 'outer', 'moldline', 'coating', 'underlie', 'chine', 'longeron', 'skin', 'near', 'gun', 'muzzle', 'return', 'gun', 'employ', 'accord', 'report', 'internally', 'mount', 'gun', 'remains', 'inaccurate', 'investigation', 'gun', 'mount', 'reveal', 'misalignment', 'result', 'muzzle', 'alignment', 'error', 'say', 'dot', 'e', 'result', 'true', 'alignment', 'gun', 'know', 'programme', 'consider', 'option', 'reboresight', 'correct', 'gun', 'know', 'change', 'fix', 'problem', 'far', 'test', 'need', 'note', 'pentagon', 'u', 'marine', 'corp', 'u', 'navy', 'carry', 'gun', 'external', 'pod', 'accurate', 'airtoground', 'fire', 'test', 'report', 'say']"
"American Airlines says it is suspending all flights to China as the coronavirus spreads, sickening more than a thousand and killing almost 200 people. The decision comes a day after the carrier's pilots sued to stop the carrier's flights to the country. American joins numerous other carriers who have already suspended or cancelled flights into China. “Based on the US Department of State's recent increase of the China Travel Advisory to a Level 4 (Do Not Travel), American is suspending its operations to and from the Chinese mainland beginning today through March 27,” the Fort Worth-based airline says on 31 January. “Our teams are contacting affected customers directly to accommodate their needs. We will continue to evaluate the schedule for March 28 and beyond and make any adjustments as necessary.” On Thursday, American Airlines pilots, represented by the Allied Pilots Association (APA), filed a lawsuit seeking an immediate halt to the carrier's flights to mainland China. The move came shortly after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the coronavirus outbreak in China an international public health emergency earlier in the day. APA represents 15,000 pilots flying for the carrier. It said in its lawsuit that American currently operates about 56 monthly flights between Dallas/Fort Worth International airport and China.

"Airbus has entered deferred prosecution arrangements with French, UK and US authorities as part of its €3.6 billion settlement of long-running investigation into allegations of corruption. The company will pay nearly €2.1 billion under a French agreement with the Parquet National Financier, plus €991 million to the UK authorities, and €526 million to US counterparts. As part of the arrangement Airbus has agreed to “full co-operation” with law enforcement partners in “any future investigations and prosecutions”, says the Serious Fraud Office. “The [fraud] investigation remains active and the position in relation to individuals is being considered,” it warns. Deferred prosecution – which applies only to organisations, rather than individuals – allow prosecution for economic crimes to be conditionally suspended for a fixed period. “If the company does not honour the conditions of the [arrangement] the prosecution may resume,” adds the Serious Fraud Office, which started investigating Airbus in 2016 over allegations of bribery by external consultants. Similar probes were subsequently opened by French and US authorities. The Office says its case centred on five counts of failure to prevent bribery within both the commercial aircraft and defence divisions of Airbus, concerning activity in Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Indonesia, Taiwan and Ghana during 2011-15. Its French counterpart concentrated its inquiries on several other countries including the United Arab Emirates, China, South Korea, Nepal, India, Taiwan, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Vietnam, Japan, Turkey, Mexico, Thailand, Brazil, and Kuwait. The Serious Fraud Office states that the penalty reflects the “gravity of the conduct” but also takes into account Airbus's extensive co-operation and its efforts to reinforce compliance. Airbus says the French and UK agreements do not amount to an admission of liability, and that both involve a three-year suspension of prosecution. The company states that it is “committed” to complying with the terms of the deferred prosecution arrangements over the period. It states that the French agreement requires Airbus to submit its compliance programme to audit by the French anti-corruption agency AFA. Given this monitoring, there will be no requirement for similar measures in the UK. Airbus has also reached a three-year deferral pact with the US Department of Justice, and no independent compliance monitor will be imposed. It has also agreed to enter a consent arrangement with the Department of State which settles all civil violations of the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, and through which Airbus will retain an independent export-control compliance officer.",2,750,10.0,0.5281,"international, authority, civil, state, investigation, case, add, january, airasia, crash","['enter', 'defer', 'prosecution', 'arrangement', 'french', 'uk', 'u', 'authority', 'part', 'settlement', 'longrunning', 'investigation', 'allegation', 'corruption', 'pay', 'nearly', 'french', 'agreement', 'parquet', 'national', 'financier', 'plus', 'uk', 'authority', 'u', 'counterpart', 'part', 'arrangement', 'agree', 'full', 'cooperation', 'law', 'enforcement', 'partner', 'future', 'investigation', 'prosecution', 'say', 'serious', 'fraud', 'office', 'fraud', 'investigation', 'remains', 'active', 'position', 'relation', 'individual', 'consider', 'warns', 'defer', 'prosecution', 'applies', 'organisation', 'rather', 'individual', 'allow', 'prosecution', 'economic', 'crime', 'conditionally', 'suspend', 'fix', 'period', 'honour', 'condition', 'arrangement', 'prosecution', 'may', 'resume', 'add', 'serious', 'fraud', 'office', 'start', 'investigate', 'allegation', 'bribery', 'external', 'consultant', 'similar', 'probe', 'subsequently', 'open', 'french', 'u', 'authority', 'office', 'say', 'case', 'centre', 'count', 'failure', 'prevent', 'bribery', 'within', 'commercial', 'defence', 'division', 'concern', 'activity', 'sri', 'lanka', 'malaysia', 'indonesia', 'taiwan', 'ghana', 'french', 'counterpart', 'concentrate', 'inquiry', 'several', 'country', 'include', 'united', 'arab', 'emirate', 'south', 'korea', 'nepal', 'india', 'taiwan', 'russia', 'saudi', 'arabia', 'vietnam', 'japan', 'turkey', 'mexico', 'thailand', 'brazil', 'kuwait', 'serious', 'fraud', 'office', 'state', 'penalty', 'reflect', 'gravity', 'conduct', 'take', 'account', 'extensive', 'cooperation', 'effort', 'reinforce', 'compliance', 'say', 'french', 'uk', 'agreement', 'amount', 'admission', 'liability', 'involve', 'threeyear', 'suspension', 'prosecution', 'state', 'commit', 'comply', 'term', 'defer', 'prosecution', 'arrangement', 'period', 'state', 'french', 'agreement', 'require', 'submit', 'compliance', 'programme', 'audit', 'french', 'anticorruption', 'agency', 'afa', 'give', 'monitoring', 'requirement', 'similar', 'measure', 'uk', 'reach', 'threeyear', 'deferral', 'pact', 'u', 'department', 'justice', 'independent', 'compliance', 'monitor', 'impose', 'agree', 'enter', 'consent', 'arrangement', 'department', 'state', 'settle', 'civil', 'violation', 'international', 'traffic', 'arm', 'regulation', 'retain', 'independent', 'exportcontrol', 'compliance', 'officer']"
"German investigators have highlighted ambiguity in the regulations for stopping at holding points, after a waiting Korean Air Boeing 777-300ER was struck and badly damaged at Frankfurt by a taxiing Air Namibia Airbus A330-200. The 777-300ER (HL7204), with 261 occupants, had arrived from Seoul on 16 November last year and was instructed to stop at the hold line of the junction between taxiways M and M8. German investigation authority BFU states that, owing to the diagonal orientation of the taxiway, the aircraft came to a halt about 32m from the hold line – measured along the 777's longitudinal axis – or about 25m as viewed perpendicular to the line from the captain's position. This distance meant the 777's tail was not sufficiently clear of taxiway M, along which the A330 (V5-ANO) was travelling. It had landed 2min after the 777 after a service from Windhoek, with 229 occupants. BFU says that, according to the A330's cockpit-voice recorder, the A330 crew saw the 777 and “was aware that the distance [between them] could be close”. As the A330 passed the intersection, its left winglet struck the 777's horizontal stabiliser, inflicting serious damage to the control surface. None of those on board the aircraft was injured. BFU highlights similar previous ground collisions, including two at Frankfurt in 1998-99, which involved “uncertainty” over the distance at which the aircraft must stop before a holding point. It says it recommended in its earlier investigations that ICAO-approved “hold short” instructions should be “replaced by a more precise phrase”, but that this recommendation “was not implemented”.",1,751,7.0,0.3958,"crew, runway, inquiry, land, approach, accident, investigator, captain, incident, pilot","['german', 'investigator', 'highlight', 'ambiguity', 'regulation', 'stop', 'hold', 'point', 'wait', 'korean', 'struck', 'badly', 'damage', 'frankfurt', 'taxi', 'namibia', 'occupant', 'arrive', 'seoul', 'november', 'instruct', 'stop', 'hold', 'line', 'junction', 'taxiway', 'german', 'investigation', 'authority', 'bfu', 'state', 'owe', 'diagonal', 'orientation', 'taxiway', 'come', 'halt', 'hold', 'line', 'measure', 'along', 'longitudinal', 'axis', 'view', 'perpendicular', 'line', 'captain', 'position', 'distance', 'meant', 'tail', 'sufficiently', 'clear', 'taxiway', 'along', 'travel', 'land', 'service', 'windhoek', 'occupant', 'bfu', 'say', 'accord', 'cockpitvoice', 'recorder', 'crew', 'saw', 'aware', 'distance', 'close', 'pass', 'intersection', 'left', 'winglet', 'struck', 'horizontal', 'stabiliser', 'inflict', 'serious', 'damage', 'control', 'surface', 'none', 'board', 'injured', 'bfu', 'highlight', 'similar', 'previous', 'ground', 'collision', 'include', 'frankfurt', 'involve', 'uncertainty', 'distance', 'must', 'stop', 'hold', 'point', 'say', 'recommend', 'earlier', 'investigation', 'icaoapproved', 'hold', 'short', 'instruction', 'replace', 'precise', 'phrase', 'recommendation', 'implement']"
"US aerostructures firm Spirit AeroSystems is having to deal with further pressure after it replaced its chief financial officer and a vice-president over an accounting mishap. Chief financial officer Jose Garcia and vice-president John Gilson, principal accounting officer, have resigned in the wake of the findings, which followed a review of accounting compliance. Spirit had commenced the review last month after “receiving information through its established compliance processes”. “As a result of the review, which is ongoing, Spirit determined that it did not comply with its established accounting processes related to certain potential contingent liabilities,” it says. These liabilities were received by the company after the end of its 2019 third quarter. While it believes the situation will not require a restatement of its financial results for the third quarter, or “materially impact” its full-year accounts, the company says it has yet to reach final conclusions. Spirit has already been burdened by grounding of the Boeing 737 Max, for which it supplies fuselages, and has embarked on a production halt and job cuts while the situation persists. Garcia and Gibson have resigned from their posts and “all other employment or board positions” within the company and its subsidiaries, but arrangements relating to their departure “have not been finalised”, Spirit told the Securities Exchange Commission. The company has appointed a new chief financial officer, Mark Suchinski, as well as a new principal accounting officer, Damon Ward, after their predecessors stepped down. Spirit says it “anticipates fully co-operating” with any inquiries that the SEC might have, and is taking steps to “strengthen procedures” to ensure contingent liabilities are “processed correctly in the future”.",1,752,0.0,0.1573,"order, business, jet, delivery, production, customer, deliver, commercial, quarter, include","['u', 'aerostructures', 'firm', 'spirit', 'aerosystems', 'deal', 'far', 'pressure', 'replace', 'chief', 'financial', 'officer', 'vicepresident', 'accounting', 'mishap', 'chief', 'financial', 'officer', 'jose', 'garcia', 'vicepresident', 'john', 'gilson', 'principal', 'accounting', 'officer', 'resign', 'wake', 'finding', 'follow', 'review', 'accounting', 'compliance', 'spirit', 'commenced', 'review', 'month', 'receive', 'information', 'establish', 'compliance', 'process', 'result', 'review', 'ongoing', 'spirit', 'determine', 'comply', 'establish', 'accounting', 'process', 'related', 'certain', 'potential', 'contingent', 'liability', 'say', 'liability', 'receive', 'end', 'third', 'quarter', 'believe', 'situation', 'require', 'restatement', 'financial', 'result', 'third', 'quarter', 'materially', 'impact', 'fullyear', 'account', 'say', 'yet', 'reach', 'final', 'conclusion', 'spirit', 'already', 'burden', 'ground', 'supply', 'fuselage', 'embark', 'production', 'halt', 'job', 'cut', 'situation', 'persists', 'garcia', 'gibson', 'resign', 'post', 'employment', 'board', 'position', 'within', 'subsidiary', 'arrangement', 'relate', 'departure', 'finalise', 'spirit', 'told', 'security', 'exchange', 'commission', 'appoint', 'chief', 'financial', 'officer', 'mark', 'suchinski', 'well', 'principal', 'accounting', 'officer', 'damon', 'ward', 'predecessor', 'step', 'spirit', 'say', 'anticipates', 'fully', 'cooperate', 'inquiry', 'sec', 'might', 'take', 'step', 'strengthen', 'procedure', 'ensure', 'contingent', 'liability', 'process', 'correctly', 'future']"
"French investigators are probing a serious approach incident involving a misaligned Hop Bombardier CRJ700 at Lyon earlier this month. The aircraft had been operating from Lille on 23 January and was conducting the approach – about 25min before sunrise – to runway 35R. Meteorological data from Lyon shows freezing fog and visibility down to 400m, with the runway visual range for 35R at 275m and falling. French investigation authority BEA says the airport was operating under low-visibility procedures and the CRJ700 was carrying out an ILS Category III approach. But the authority says the aircraft “deviated to the left” during the final approach and the crew aborted the landing. The jet subsequently flew over the threshold of the parallel runway 35L as well as the “aerodrome facilities”, without elaborating.

"American Airlines pilots, represented by the Allied Pilots Association (APA), have filed a lawsuit seeking an immediate halt to the carrier's flights to mainland China. This came shortly after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the coronavirus outbreak in China an international public health emergency on 30 January. The union represents 15,000 pilots flying for the carrier. It notes in its lawsuit that American currently operates about 56 monthly flights between Dallas/Fort Worth International airport and China. Furthermore, the carrier's plans to suspend flights between Los Angeles International airport and China do not take effect until 9 February. Cirium schedules that shows that for the month of January, American Airlines scheduled 108 direct flights between Dallas Fort Worth and Los Angeles to Beijing Capital and Shanghai Pudong airports in China. This currently stands at 98 in February and 121 in March. APA estimates that each American crew member working a trip to China needs to be on the ground for approximately 32 hours between flights to comply with federal rest regulations. “We estimate that as many as 300 passengers and crew travel to Dallas/Forth Worth alone from Chinese cities on each American Airlines flight. To us, that level of risk is unacceptable,” says APA president, Eric Ferguson. The union also refers to warnings issued by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and advisories by other health organisations against all non-essential travel to China. It notes that other carriers have suspended flights to China “out of an abundance of caution”. “The APA leadership has asked American Airlines management to follow suit, but to date they have not cancelled any US-China flights. We are therefore compelled to seek injunctive relief,” says APA. In a 30 January statement, Ferguson implored APA members to decline assignments to China. “Due to the known and unknown risks associated with traveling to China right now, concurrent with the filing of our lawsuit, we are directing all American Airlines pilots assigned to flights between the United States and China, other than those on return trips to the United States, to decline the assignment.” ",1,754,5.0,0.3693,"carrier, march, international, outbreak, suspend, capacity, schedule, april, united, coronavirus","['american', 'pilot', 'represent', 'allied', 'pilot', 'association', 'apa', 'file', 'lawsuit', 'seek', 'immediate', 'halt', 'carrier', 'mainland', 'come', 'shortly', 'world', 'health', 'organization', 'declare', 'coronavirus', 'outbreak', 'international', 'public', 'health', 'emergency', 'january', 'union', 'represent', 'pilot', 'fly', 'carrier', 'note', 'lawsuit', 'american', 'currently', 'operates', 'monthly', 'worth', 'international', 'airport', 'furthermore', 'carrier', 'plan', 'suspend', 'los', 'angeles', 'international', 'airport', 'take', 'effect', 'february', 'schedule', 'month', 'january', 'american', 'schedule', 'direct', 'dallas', 'fort', 'worth', 'los', 'angeles', 'beijing', 'capital', 'shanghai', 'pudong', 'airport', 'currently', 'stand', 'february', 'march', 'apa', 'estimate', 'american', 'crew', 'member', 'work', 'trip', 'need', 'ground', 'approximately', 'hour', 'comply', 'federal', 'rest', 'regulation', 'estimate', 'many', 'passenger', 'crew', 'travel', 'worth', 'alone', 'chinese', 'city', 'american', 'u', 'level', 'risk', 'unacceptable', 'say', 'apa', 'president', 'eric', 'ferguson', 'union', 'refers', 'warning', 'issue', 'u', 'center', 'disease', 'control', 'prevention', 'cdc', 'advisory', 'health', 'organisation', 'nonessential', 'travel', 'note', 'carrier', 'suspend', 'abundance', 'caution', 'apa', 'leadership', 'ask', 'american', 'management', 'follow', 'suit', 'date', 'cancel', 'uschina', 'therefore', 'compel', 'seek', 'injunctive', 'relief', 'say', 'apa', 'january', 'statement', 'ferguson', 'implore', 'apa', 'member', 'decline', 'assignment', 'due', 'know', 'unknown', 'risk', 'associate', 'travel', 'right', 'concurrent', 'filing', 'lawsuit', 'direct', 'american', 'pilot', 'assign', 'united', 'state', 'return', 'trip', 'united', 'state', 'decline', 'assignment']"
"Singapore Airlines and SilkAir have cut a number of flights to China for February, as the outbreak of the novel coronavirus continues its unabated spread. The capacity cuts will affect SIA flights to Beijing, Shanghai Pudong and Guangzhou. SilkAir, meanwhile, will be reducing the number of flights to all four Chinese cities in its network – Chongqing, Chengdu, Xiamen and Shenzhen.  Separately, SIA's low-cost subsidiary Scoot announced it will be suspending flights to 11 points on its Chinese network from early February until the end of March. This was due to “weak demand and operational constraints” arising from the coronavirus outbreak in China, Scoot states. The destinations affected include Harbin, Hangzhou, Shenyang, Xian, Nanning, Zhengzhou, Ningbo, Jinan, Nanchang, Wuxi, as well as Changsha. Scoot's flights to Wuhan, which is the epicentre of the outbreak, remains cancelled until 28 March. The carrier has also reduced frequencies to eight other Chinese cities, including Guangzhou, Kunming, Nanjing, Tianjin as well as Macau. SIA also said it will be doing away with crew layovers in Beijing and Shanghai, which will now be operated as turnaround flights. “This is a precautionary measure for the safety of our crew,” the airline tells FlightGlobal. SIA Group's decision to cut capacity follows similar moves by other carriers in and around the region. Hong Kong-based carriers like the Cathay Pacific group and Hong Kong Airlines have jointly halved capacity into Mainland China. Air New Zealand also announced that it would be reducing frequencies on its Auckland-Shanghai flights from daily to four times weekly, from 18 February to end March. Indonesia's Lion Air Group, as well as Vietnam's VietJet, will also be cancelling all flights to China from 1 February. Air Astana is suspending all flights to Beijing and Urumqi from 3 February. European carriers such as British Airways, Lufthansa and Finnair have all scrapped service into China as well. US majors American Airlines, Delta Air LInes and United Airlines have all cut back their capacity, while Air Canada has pulled its mainland China flights altogether. The World Health Organisation (WHO) on 30 January declared the coronavirus outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.

"Airlines continue to suspend international flight capacity to mainland China in the wake of the outbreak of the new coronavirus as the World Health Organisation (WHO) declares it an international public health emergency. Since the outbreak emerged earlier in January, a number of international carriers have acted to cancel flights. While these initially focused on the city at the source of outbreak, Wuhan, it has more recently spread to wider international flights network serving the Chinese mainland. Air FranceandKLMon 30 January become the latest European airlines to temporarily suspend scheduled flights The two carriers had already pulled some China flights - including Air France's Wuhan service - but will now suspend their respective Beijing and Shanghai flights until 9 February. Turkish Airlines has also now announced that to “evaluate the situation” regarding the outbreak, it is suspending its flights to the Chinese cities of Beijing, Guangzhou, Shanghai and Xi'an. Finnair had already cancelled its flights to Beijing Daxing and Nanjing following the suspension of group travel by the Chinese authorities - though it has retained its flights to  Beijing, Guangzhou and Shanghai - while British Airways and Lufthansa Group carriers suspended their flights to the Chinese mainland on 29 January. Likewise North American carriers have taken action. US majors American Airlines, Delta Air LInes and United Airlines have all cut back their capacity, while Air Canada has pulled its mainland China flights altogether. The WHO had initially stopped short of declaring the outbreak as a global public health emergency at a meeting on 22 January, though noting it would review the situation given its fast-development. Now following a second meeting of its Emergency Committee regarding the outbreak, it on 30 January declared the outbreak of the coronavirus in China constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. WHO says there have have 170 deaths so far from outbreak - which has now has 7,711 confirmed cases and more than 12,000 suspected cases It also says there are now 83 cases in 18 countries. Of these, only seven had no history of travel in China. Whilst crediting China for its strong action in working to limit the spread of the virus, the Emergency Committee judged that the outbreak now meets the criteria for a public health emergency of international concern. ”The Committee believes that it is still possible to interrupt virus spread, provided that countries put in place strong measures to detect disease early, isolate and treat cases. ”In line with the need for global solidarity, the Committee felt that a global coordinated effort is needed to enhance preparedness in other regions of the world that may need additional support for that,” it says.

"Air Canada says it will suspend all direct flights to Beijing and Shanghai through February, following a notice from Canada's government advising against non-essential travel to mainland China on fears about the deadly Wuhan coronavirus. The suspension of the carrier's outbound flights from Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver begins 30 January, while return flights from China will end 31 January. “Affected customers will be notified and offered options, including travel on other carriers where available, or a full refund,” Air Canada says in a statement on 29 January. Air Canada operates 70 flights per week on China routes between Shanghai, Beijing, Vancouver, Montreal and Toronto, Cirium schedules data shows.

"Boeing anticipates its 737 Max production rate will return to previously expected levels several years after the company restarts Max production, which could come within the next several months. Executives laid out that timeline during Boeing's 29 January earnings call, signalling Max production rate will remain significantly less than rival Airbus's A320-family production rate for the foreseeable future.  Boeing stored hundreds of 737 Max amid the grounding, now in its eleventh month. “We've assumed we will resume 737 Max production at low rates in 2020...Then we expect to gradually increase to previously planned production rates over the next few years,” says Boeing chief financial officer Greg Smith. Boeing declines to say at which rate it intends to restart production or to provide timelines for rate increases. “When the supply chain has stability, we will make the next rate increase,” Smith says. Prior to the March 2019 grounding, Chicago-based Boeing produced 52 737s monthly and anticipated hiking production to 57 aircraft monthly in 2019, followed by possible further rate hikes. Airbus produced about 53 A320-family aircraft in 2019 and plans to boost production to 63 aircraft in 2021. After the grounding took effect, Boeing continued Max production, albeit at a reduced rate of 42 aircraft monthly. Finally, this month, with the certification timeline still uncertain, Boeing temporarily halted Max production. Boeing expects FAA certification will come by mid-year, meaning production could restart within several months, Boeing chief executive David Calhoun said recently. During the grounding Boeing had stockpiled produced Max at several US airfields. The company has not disclosed exactly how many Max are in storage. But the number stands to be more than 400 based on a 42-aircraft monthly production rate from March to December 2019. Once regulators do clear the Max to fly, Boeing faces the massive task of getting all those aircraft into service. “Return to service...will be a one-and-a-half-year programme based on the [aircraft] in inventory,” says Calhoun on 29 January. Smith clarifies that most currently-stored Max will be delivered with in a year of when the grounding lifts. Calhoun also insists neither a tight supply of flight simulators nor the FAA's new airworthiness certification requirements will delay that timeline. “That is not really a problem,” Calhoun says of simulator availability, noting that Boeing in October 2019 began “building the capacity” of available flight simulators. “The capacity for flight simulators is getting very close to where we can handle” the return-to-service plan, he says. The FAA is expected to require simulator training for pilots as part of its return-to-service plan. Smith says only 36 Max simulators currently exist. Additionally, last year the FAA announced it will now issue individual airworthiness certificates for each specific 737 Max, taking over aircraft-specific approvals it had previously delegated to Boeing.

"Erickson signed a development agreement to integrate its S-64 Air Crane helicopter with Sikorsky's Matrix autonomous flight control software. The Portland, Oregon-based company plans to conduct an autonomous flight demonstration in 2021 using the technology, it disclosed at the Heli-Expo trade show in Anaheim, California on 29 January.  The S-64's mechanical flight controls will be removed and replaced with fly-by-wire controls. It will be a process similar to Sikorsky's efforts in 2019 to transform a UH-60A, the oldest model of the Black Hawk, into an autonomous helicopter, says Erickson. In particular, Erickson believes the Matrix system's sense-and-avoid abilities could allow the S-64 to conduct firefighting water drops during night or in low-visibility situations, such as when a pilot's sight is clouded by smoke. “We've had missions where the smoke was so bad we literally couldn't see the fire on the ground and so [we were] unable to drop [water on the fire],” says Hayden Olson, vice-president of aerosystems with Erickson. “We want to be able to expand how often we can operate in those conditions and do it safely.” Chris Van Buiten, vice-president of Sikorsky Innovations, adds that autonomy is a safeguard against cognitive overload for aerial firefighting pilots who may be distracted or overwhelmed when flying complex missions. Previously, Sikorsky's Matrix-controlled helicopters have relied on sensors, such as Lidar, cameras and digital terrain obstacle databases, to guide their autonomous flights. Erickson is still determining what it aims to do in its first demonstration of the autonomous S-64, though the flight would likely include the helicopter showing its ability to do water drops and pickups. The company may attempt a logistical demonstration after that. Though firefighting is the initial interest, an autonomous S-64 could also be useful for military cargo resupply missions, as well as longline load lifting or natural disaster responses, says Dempsey of Erickson. The technology could eventually enable one-pilot or unpiloted operations, says Van Buiten of Sikorsky. “We talk about the 2-1-0 switch: two crew, one crew, zero crew,” he says. “[For example], if a horrible day ever happens and we're tasked to drop concrete on the Fukushima nuclear reactor...we'd be delighted to flip the switch on zero [crew flight] and have this big heavy lifting machine running sorties unmanned to save the day.” In addition to building the S-64, Erickson flies 20 examples of the aircraft itself for firefighting or air lifting services. Including its own aircraft, the company says there are about 45 S-64s in operation around the world. Erickson plans on eventually offering the autonomy technology as an upgrade to operators of the S-64. Matrix is one part of a larger upgrade package the company is developing, called the S-64F+. Erickson believes there is a market for 50 to 100 upgrade packages and new-built examples of the S-64F+. Eventually, all production-new Air Cranes would be manufactured to the S-64F+ configuration, the company says. But the manufacturer is offering few details about the S-64+ configuration, saying that it is still in development. The aircraft is to have a new engine that would increase range, fuel efficiency and payload capacity. The engine model has not been selected as the company is evaluating its options in consultation with Piasecki Aircraft, it says. The helicopter would have composite main rotor blades, says Erickson. It would also have an “improved water cannon.” Erickson says it does not know when the S-64F+ configuration would be available for delivery, citing the need to receive a certificate from the Federal Aviation Administration, as well as decisions on various subsystems that have yet to be made. The S-64 is the civilian version of the 1960s-era Sikorsky CH-54 Tarhe, a twin-engined heavy lift helicopter built for the US Army which has its cabin carved out to allow for carrying special loads. The firefighting version carries a 10,000 liter (2,650gal) water tank in its belly. The S-64 can also be used as a cargo air lifter using a sling. Erickson purchased the intellectual property behind the S-64 from Sikorsky in 1992. A handful are produced each year from scratch or via remanufacturing legacy CH-54 airframes at the company's facilities in Medford, Oregon. Most recently, the firm delivered an S-64 to the Korean Forest Service in November 2019, with another due for delivery in South Korea in 2020. Additionally, it plans to deliver one S-64 in 2020 and a second example in 2021 to Italy's fire and rescue service.

"Boeing has announced another 787 production rate cut, saying it plans to lower output of the widebody to 10 aircraft monthly by early 2021. The airframer, which now produces about 14 787s per month, attributes the change to “the current environment and near-term market outlook”.  Shanghai Airlines' first 787-9. In November 2019, Boeing disclosed plans to reduce 787 production from 14 to 12 aircraft monthly in late 2020 and remain at that rate for two years. But in a full-year earnings release on 29 January, the company said it would trim production further, to 10 Dreamliners per month in “early 2021”, returning to 12 aircraft per month in 2023. The rate cut comes amid ongoing uncertainty about widebody demand from airlines in Asia, particularly those based in China.

"Boeing now pegs the financial impact of the 737 Max grounding at $18.6 billion, including estimated costs associated with concessions to customers and disruption to the now-halted production line. The Chicago-headquartered company disclosed its latest estimates on 29 January, the same day it reported a full-year 2019 net loss of $636 million, down from a net profit of $10.5 billion the year before.  Boeing has been storing produced 737 Max amid the grounding. Boeing now anticipates concessions to 737 Max customers will cost it $8.3 billion, rising by $2.6 billion on the previous estimate of $5.6 billion. Additionally, the company now predicts it will incur $6.3 billion in additional “estimated costs to produce 737 aircraft included in the accounting quality”. That figure includes $3.6 billion in costs attributed to the first nine months of 2019, and an additional $2.6 billion in the fourth quarter. Boeing also anticipates its future financial results will be hammered by $4 billion in “abnormal production costs to be incurred during the suspension and gradual resumption of production at low production rates, primarily to be expensed in 2020”. The latest projections came as the company reported financial results hammered by the 737 Max grounding, which has been in effect since March 2019. Last year's $636 million net loss was on revenue of $76.6 billion, down 24% from $1.1 trillion in 2018. Boeing posted a fourth-quarter net loss of $1 billion, reversing a $3.4 billion net profit one year earlier. Fourth-quarter 2019 revenue slumped 37% year on year to $17.9 billion. “We recognise we have a lot of work to do...We are focused on returning the 737 Max to service and restoring the longstanding trust that the Boeing brand represents to the flying public,” chief executive David Calhoun says. The commercial aircraft division posted $32.3 billion in 2019 revenue, down 44% year-on-year, and a full-year operating loss of $6.7 billion, reversing an operating profit of $7.8 billion in 2018.

"Ryanair has reached a four-year labour agreement with the union representing its Ireland-based pilots, but has renewed its warning of potential job losses and base closures as a result of the latest Boeing 737 Max delay. In a stock-exchange notice issued today, the Irish budget carrier said it had “accepted before Christmas” the recommendations put forward by independent mediator Kieran Mulvey for a collective labour agreement (CLA) with trade union Forsa. The deal, which runs through to 2024, covers all ofRyanair's “directly employed” pilots in Ireland. ”Ryanair will now implement the terms of this CLA, which will deliver a new pay structure along with a fixed 5/4 roster for the next four years,” states the airline. ”Ryanair would like to thank Kieran Mulvey for his contribution and expertise in overseeing this mediation process, which has now concluded.” The agreement follows a turbulent period of strike threats and industrial unrest at the airline. Pilots represented by the Forsa union had voted in favour of strike action last August, but the planned 48h stoppage was prevented from going ahead after the Irish High Court ruled against it. Ryanair faced similar threats from unions representing its Spanish and UK-based pilots. Confirmation of the labour deal comes two days after the airline wrote to staff to warn of the possibility of job losses and base closures, following Boeing's announcement earlier this month that it now does not expect the 737 Max to return to service until the middle of this year. In a 27 January memo to employees, Ryanair chief executive Eddie Wilson writes that the airline does not expect the start taking delivery of the Max until September or October “at the earliest”. Ryanair had hoped to have 10 Max aircraft by June 2020 but says it will now have to remove these aircraft from its flight schedule. “Sadly, this means we cannot rule out further base cuts and closures,” Wilson adds in the memo. “We will do our best to avoid any more base closures, but this will mean eliminating at least 10 aircraft from existing bases, and so further pilot and cabin crew jobs losses cannot be ruled out. “We will try to advise all bases in the first or second week of February as to what further cuts and/or closures will be required as a direct result of these further Boeing Max delivery delays.”",1,763,2.0,0.233,"executive, chief, cut, add, situation, staff, crisis, make, coronavirus, employee","['ryanair', 'reach', 'fouryear', 'labour', 'agreement', 'union', 'represent', 'irelandbased', 'pilot', 'renew', 'warn', 'potential', 'job', 'loss', 'base', 'closure', 'result', 'late', 'delay', 'stockexchange', 'notice', 'issue', 'today', 'irish', 'budget', 'carrier', 'say', 'accepted', 'christmas', 'recommendation', 'put', 'forward', 'independent', 'mediator', 'kieran', 'mulvey', 'collective', 'labour', 'agreement', 'cla', 'trade', 'union', 'forsa', 'deal', 'run', 'cover', 'ofryanair', 'directly', 'employ', 'pilot', 'ireland', 'ryanair', 'implement', 'term', 'cla', 'deliver', 'pay', 'structure', 'along', 'fix', 'roster', 'next', 'state', 'ryanair', 'like', 'thank', 'kieran', 'mulvey', 'contribution', 'expertise', 'oversee', 'mediation', 'process', 'agreement', 'follow', 'turbulent', 'period', 'strike', 'threat', 'industrial', 'unrest', 'pilot', 'represent', 'forsa', 'union', 'vote', 'favour', 'strike', 'action', 'august', 'plan', 'stoppage', 'prevent', 'go', 'ahead', 'irish', 'high', 'court', 'rule', 'ryanair', 'face', 'similar', 'threat', 'union', 'represent', 'spanish', 'ukbased', 'pilot', 'confirmation', 'labour', 'deal', 'come', 'day', 'write', 'staff', 'warn', 'possibility', 'job', 'loss', 'base', 'closure', 'follow', 'announcement', 'earlier', 'month', 'expect', 'return', 'service', 'middle', 'january', 'memo', 'employee', 'ryanair', 'chief', 'executive', 'eddie', 'wilson', 'writes', 'expect', 'start', 'take', 'delivery', 'september', 'october', 'early', 'ryanair', 'hop', 'june', 'say', 'remove', 'schedule', 'sadly', 'mean', 'rule', 'far', 'base', 'cut', 'closure', 'wilson', 'add', 'memo', 'best', 'avoid', 'base', 'closure', 'mean', 'eliminate', 'least', 'exist', 'base', 'far', 'pilot', 'cabin', 'crew', 'job', 'loss', 'rule', 'try', 'advise', 'base', 'second', 'week', 'february', 'far', 'cut', 'closure', 'require', 'direct', 'result', 'far', 'delivery', 'delay']"
"Russian airframer Irkut has received the first Aviadvigatel PD-14 engines for the MC-21 at its assembly line in Irkutsk. The domestically-built engines, manufactured in Perm, have been transported by road over a distance of nearly 4,000km according to United Engine Corporation. Upon arrival at the assembly line earlier this month they were transferred to a podding facility for checks, to ensure they were not affected by vibration, before being prepared for nacelle and thrust-reverser installation. The engines will be fitted to a flight-test MC-21-300 to join four other MC-21s – all powered by the rival Pratt & Whitney PW1400G – which are participating in the certification campaign. Special technical teams have been assembled by the engine's designer and manufacturer to ensure a rapid response to any maintenance demands when the testing commences.

After disclosing the initial decision, the airline subsequently clarified that the suspension will remain in place until 31 January while it assesses the situation. “We apologise to customers for the inconvenience, but the safety of our customers and crew is always our priority,” it adds. Hong Kong services are unaffected. The UK's Foreign and Commonwealth Office had already recommended not to travel to Hubei province as a result of the coronavirus outbreak.

"Hong Kong's four main carriers will halve their services into Mainland China, as part of special arrangements made in light of a novel coronavirus outbreak in China. The Hong Kong government said in a 28 January press briefing that the carriers – Cathay Pacific, Cathay Dragon, Hong Kong Express, as well as Hong Kong Airlines (HKA) – will cut capacity to 24 points in Mainland China. Service frequency between Hong Kong and these points will go from about 480 flights weekly, to about 240 flights from 30 January, until further notice. Hong Kong has already moved to suspend flights between Hong Kong and Hubei province since 24 January. The coronavirus outbreak originated from Wuhan city, the capital of Hubei province. The move to reduce the number of flights to Mainland China comes as part of a broader move by the Hong Kong authorities to “reduce the risk” of the coronavirus outbreak from spreading. Cathay and Cathay Dragon say in a separate media release that the capacity reduction will take place till the end of March. “We are actively reviewing our flight schedules at the moment and will be updating them progressively over the next 48 hours,” the carriers state. Cirium schedules data indicates that Cathay and Cathay Dragon jointly fly to 22 cities from Hong Kong. Meanwhile, HKA says its cancellations will last till 11 February. The service cuts will affect 10 points on its Mainland China network, including destinations such as Haikou, Chengdu and Tianjin. The carrier flies to 11 points in Mainland China, schedules data reveals. As for HK Express, it only flies to Ningbo. The carrier did not state if it was fully suspending the route, or reducing its frequency. According to Chinese state media, as of 29 January, the death toll in China from the outbreak hit 132, with the number of confirmed cases to be more than 5,900. Apart from China, other countries affected by the outbreak include Singapore, Australia, Canada, the USA, France, Japan and Thailand. Sri Lanka is the latest country to report a case.

"Leonardo Helicopters plans to take delivery of the first AW609 simulator at its Philadelphia, Pennsylvania facility in the summer of 2020. The full flight simulator is to be built by CAE, and is being received ahead of airworthiness certification and first delivery, event dates which Leonardo declines to predict. Two aircraft are also in final production at Leonardo Helicopter's Philadelphia production facility. At least one example is planned for completion before the end of 2020. The company has built four test aircraft and it aims to be heavily testing all of the tiltrotors this year to gain FAA certification as soon as possible. The company flew its production-representative test aircraft for the first time on 23 December 2019. Offshore helicopter operator ERA, which on 24 January announced a merger with recently restructured Bristow, remains the launch customer of the AW609. Leonardo Helicopters declines to disclose any new customers or detail its backlog of orders. The company believes the AW609 will likely be initially adopted as a VIP transport for time-pressed executives. “Typically with new technology, we see early adoption through VIP,” says Bill Sunick, head of tiltrotor marketing. “I don't think this will be any different.” The tiltrotor has capacity for nine passengers, in addition to two crew. The AW609 is also being pitched for the oil and gas, search and rescue, and emergency medical services industries, says Sunick. Previously, the rotorcraft manufacturer said the AW609 would be certificated and entered into service in 2020.

"Airbus has disclosed that it will take a provision of €3.6 billion ($4 billion) to cover penalty payments following its preliminary agreements to settle investigations by three states into alleged corruption in its activities. The agreements in principle centre on probes by UK, French and US regulators and remain subject to court approval, says Airbus. It states that the agreement with UK authorities has been the subject of a preliminary court ruling on 28 January, while further court hearings in the UK, France and USA are expected on 31 January. The €3.6 billion provision, which will be booked in Airbus's accounts for 2019, will depend on the agreements securing court approval. “Further details will be provided once the agreements have been finalised,” says the airframer. Concerns had emerged in early 2016 over Airbus applications for export credit, which the airframer had voluntarily flagged to UK Export Finance. The finance agency suspended consideration of export credit requests from Airbus and referred the concerns to the UK's Serious Fraud Office. Airbus was subsequently placed under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office, over allegations of corruption centred on irregularities regarding third-party consultants. Pressure on the airframer increased over the following year as the French judicial institution Parquet National Financier joined the UK fraud investigation, similarly looking into third-party consultant activity and alleged bribery. Airbus also found itself scrutinised in 2017 by a separate US probe into defence contracts, after a review of compliance procedures turned up “inaccuracies” and “shortcomings”, the company said, in filings to the US Department of State. The problems were linked to the US rules contained in its International Traffic in Arms Regulations, particularly the section addressing disclosure of fees and commission. Airbus stresses that it has co-operated with all the investigative parties involved. In 2018 the company reached an €81 million agreement to end a European defence investigation from German prosecutors into allegations of corruption relating to the sale of fighters to Austria in 2003. While Airbus appeared unaffected by the absence of export credit in a relatively buoyant financial environment, the manufacturer was aware of the perception that the investigations generated. Its senior management moved to reinforce its compliance oversight by establishing an independent review panel with representatives from France, Germany and the UK. Then-chief executive Tom Enders said at the time that the company needed to take a “hard look” at its systems and cultures in order to “embed irreproachable behaviours” in its activities. Airbus also opted to recruit a number of external candidates to the most senior positions, as various board members retired, a step intended to underpin the impression of transparency.",1,768,10.0,0.3653,"international, authority, civil, state, investigation, case, add, january, airasia, crash","['disclose', 'take', 'provision', 'cover', 'penalty', 'payment', 'follow', 'preliminary', 'agreement', 'settle', 'investigation', 'state', 'allege', 'corruption', 'activity', 'agreement', 'principle', 'centre', 'probe', 'uk', 'french', 'u', 'regulator', 'remain', 'subject', 'court', 'approval', 'say', 'state', 'agreement', 'uk', 'authority', 'subject', 'preliminary', 'court', 'ruling', 'january', 'far', 'court', 'hearing', 'uk', 'france', 'usa', 'expect', 'january', 'provision', 'book', 'account', 'depend', 'agreement', 'secure', 'court', 'approval', 'far', 'detail', 'provide', 'agreement', 'finalise', 'say', 'airframer', 'concern', 'emerge', 'early', 'application', 'export', 'credit', 'airframer', 'voluntarily', 'flag', 'uk', 'export', 'finance', 'finance', 'agency', 'suspend', 'consideration', 'export', 'credit', 'request', 'refer', 'concern', 'uk', 'serious', 'fraud', 'office', 'subsequently', 'place', 'investigation', 'serious', 'fraud', 'office', 'allegation', 'corruption', 'centre', 'irregularity', 'regard', 'thirdparty', 'consultant', 'pressure', 'airframer', 'increase', 'follow', 'french', 'judicial', 'institution', 'parquet', 'national', 'financier', 'join', 'uk', 'fraud', 'investigation', 'similarly', 'look', 'thirdparty', 'consultant', 'activity', 'allege', 'bribery', 'found', 'scrutinise', 'separate', 'u', 'probe', 'defence', 'contract', 'review', 'compliance', 'procedure', 'turn', 'inaccuracy', 'shortcoming', 'say', 'filing', 'u', 'department', 'state', 'problem', 'link', 'u', 'rule', 'contain', 'international', 'traffic', 'arm', 'regulation', 'particularly', 'section', 'address', 'disclosure', 'fee', 'commission', 'stress', 'cooperate', 'investigative', 'party', 'involve', 'reach', 'agreement', 'end', 'european', 'defence', 'investigation', 'german', 'prosecutor', 'allegation', 'corruption', 'relate', 'sale', 'fighter', 'austria', 'appear', 'unaffected', 'absence', 'export', 'credit', 'relatively', 'buoyant', 'financial', 'environment', 'manufacturer', 'aware', 'perception', 'investigation', 'generate', 'senior', 'management', 'move', 'reinforce', 'compliance', 'oversight', 'establish', 'independent', 'review', 'panel', 'representative', 'france', 'germany', 'uk', 'thenchief', 'executive', 'tom', 'enders', 'say', 'need', 'take', 'hard', 'look', 'system', 'culture', 'order', 'embed', 'irreproachable', 'behaviour', 'activity', 'opt', 'recruit', 'number', 'external', 'candidate', 'senior', 'position', 'various', 'board', 'member', 'retire', 'step', 'intend', 'underpin', 'impression', 'transparency']"
"Pratt & Whitney is still working through a retrofit effort to fix the three major issues afflicting PW1000G-series engines, but expects the activity to be concluded this year. However, Greg Hayes, chief executive of parent company United Technologies, says that there are “no new durability issues” with the geared turbofan (GTF), the majority of which have been seen on PW1100Gs for the Airbus A320neo family. Hayes, speaking on a full-year earnings call on 28 January, identified the three issues as premature degradation of third-stage turbine blades, vibration from the auxiliary gearbox, and combustor liners that are deteriorating faster than expected. While the retrofit programmes for each issue are under way, Hayes acknowledges that the durability problems are “causing operators pain”, particularly in challenging operating environments such as China and India. In the latter, he references both IndiGo and GoAir as particularly encumbered by early-build engines featuring the previous turbine blade design. This was made from a titanium-aluminium alloy which proved too fragile in use, especially when subject to foreign object debris ingestion, and could fracture, causing in-flight shutdowns. “We are doing some accelerated inspections and accelerated retrofits to get this older-design blade out of the fleet,” says Hayes. New-build engines are not affected, and the retrofit work should be concluded by the second half, he says. So far, over 1,400 GTF engines are in service, says Hayes, which have accumulated over 4.3 million flight hours. He is confident that P&W can add to its backlog of over 10,000 GTF engines and increase its current 40% market share on the A320neo family. Hayes points out that P&W has won about 50% of engine contests for the A320neo family over the last 12 months, with its overall share higher on the larger A321neo. CFM International Leap-1As are also an option on the A320neo.

"United Technologies (UTC) forecasts that Boeing will suspend production of the 737 Max for around 90 days, then start building the narrowbody again at a rate of 21 aircraft per month. Speaking on a full-year earnings call on 28 January, chief executive Greg Hayes said that the “90-day production delay” was “consistent with the direction we have received from Boeing”, with whom it has been in “constant contact”. The airframer stopped building the 737 Max earlier this month amid the ongoing grounding crisis. UTC's Collins Aerospace unit supplies several systems onto the 737 Max, including avionics and brakes, and Hayes forecasts that the three-month suspension will cost the business around $300 million in lost revenue and $150 million in operating profit. Lost revenue for the full year will be around $600 million, he says. Once production resumes it will be “cut in half” from the 42-per-month rate seen prior to the suspension, says Hayes. Hayes says that UTC is forecasting a $400 million cash impact at Collins Aerospace for the full year, which includes some money – less than $100 million – to keep its supply chain healthy. “Any time you have these kind of production disruptions you always worry about the supply chain and some of the smaller suppliers out there,” he says. “We are trying to manage that proactively so we don't have a problem when we start the line back up with suppliers who can't meet demand.” But despite the suspension and lower rate once Max production resumes, Collins Aerospace does not presently see a requirement to lay off staff, says Hayes. Meanwhile, UTC expects the closure of its merger with Raytheon early in the second quarter. This will see a new aerospace and defence business formed called Raytheon Technologies, with UTC also divesting its Carrier refrigeration and Otis elevators units. While 2020 is the “last chapter of United Technologies as it stands”, Hayes is positive about a “bright future” for Raytheon Technologies, which will also include engine maker Pratt & Whitney.

"Ryanairgroup chief executive Michael O'Leary has ratcheted up his criticism of the UK government's rescue ofFlybe, describing the business model of the regional carrier “doomed to fail” and arguing that the deal contravenes state-aid rules. In an open letter to UK chancellor Sajid Javid, O'Leary writes thatFlybewas purchased last year “by a group of billionaires” for £2 million ($2.6 million) “in the full knowledge thatFlybewas a loss-making business”. He complains: “Your suggestion that Sir Richard Branson (billionaire),Delta Airlines(a multibillion-dollar airline), Stobart Group and Cyrus Capital (a $4 billion venture capital fund) need 'time to pay' is absurd.” O'Leary is demanding that the government publish the terms of its deal with Flybe, arguing that doing so is a legal requirement. On reports that the UK government is preparing a loan to Flybe, O'Leary writes: “If Richard Branson and his mates won't lend £100 million to Flybe, then why should the hard pressed British taxpayer rescue them?” Disputing that Flybe is a viable business – which was cited as a justification for rescuing them – O'Leary comments that it has “lurched from failure to failure over the last 20 years” with a business model based on “carrying a small number of passengers, at very high fares, on half-empty turboprop aircraft”. This, he says, “has always failed and is doomed to keep failing”. O'Leary suggests that any genuine attempt to improve connectivity to the UK regions would involve a reduction of air passenger duty for all airlines. He also asserts that the decision to allow Flybe to defer its air passenger duty payments is in breach of state-aid rules. Following the threat of collapse, Flybe secured a rescue deal earlier this month as the UK government sought to ensure regional connectivity, especially to parts of the country that are islands or have weak rail or other air links.",1,771,8.0,0.4522,"government, uk, carrier, business, state, share, south, airway, financial, plan","['ryanairgroup', 'chief', 'executive', 'michael', 'ratchet', 'criticism', 'uk', 'government', 'rescue', 'offlybe', 'describe', 'business', 'model', 'regional', 'carrier', 'doom', 'fail', 'argue', 'deal', 'contravenes', 'stateaid', 'rule', 'open', 'letter', 'uk', 'chancellor', 'sajid', 'javid', 'writes', 'thatflybewas', 'purchase', 'billionaire', 'full', 'knowledge', 'thatflybewas', 'lossmaking', 'business', 'complains', 'suggestion', 'sir', 'richard', 'branson', 'billionaire', 'delta', 'multibilliondollar', 'stobart', 'cyrus', 'capital', 'venture', 'capital', 'fund', 'need', 'pay', 'demand', 'government', 'publish', 'term', 'deal', 'flybe', 'argue', 'legal', 'requirement', 'report', 'uk', 'government', 'prepare', 'loan', 'flybe', 'writes', 'richard', 'branson', 'mate', 'wo', 'lend', 'flybe', 'hard', 'press', 'british', 'taxpayer', 'rescue', 'dispute', 'flybe', 'viable', 'business', 'cite', 'justification', 'rescue', 'comment', 'lurch', 'failure', 'failure', 'business', 'model', 'base', 'carry', 'small', 'number', 'passenger', 'high', 'fare', 'halfempty', 'turboprop', 'say', 'always', 'fail', 'doom', 'keep', 'fail', 'suggests', 'genuine', 'attempt', 'improve', 'connectivity', 'uk', 'region', 'involve', 'reduction', 'passenger', 'duty', 'asserts', 'decision', 'allow', 'flybe', 'defer', 'passenger', 'duty', 'payment', 'breach', 'stateaid', 'rule', 'follow', 'threat', 'collapse', 'flybe', 'secure', 'rescue', 'deal', 'earlier', 'month', 'uk', 'government', 'sought', 'ensure', 'regional', 'connectivity', 'especially', 'part', 'country', 'island', 'weak', 'rail', 'link']"
"A Bombardier E-11A communications aircraft operated by the US Air Force has crashed in Afghanistan's Ghazni province. Images on social media appear to show the aircraft, which bears registration 11-9358, burning on a snowy field. “A US Bombardier E-11A crashed today in Ghazni province, Afghanistan,” said US Forces Afghanistan spokesman Colonel Sonny Leggett in a tweet. “While the cause of crash is under investigation, there are no indications the crash was caused by enemy fire.” The number of deaths or injuries is not clear, but an Associated Press report suggests that eyewitnesses on the ground spotted two bodies. The E-11A serves as a Battlefield Airborne Communications Node (BACN), enabling the networking of disparate forces and assets in a given region. Including the aircraft that crashed, the US Air Force operates its entire fleet of four E-11As from Kandahar International Airport. The type is based on the Global 6000 business jet.

"One day after basketball star Kobe Bryant died in a helicopter accident, the world's largest helicopter association attempted to calm public fears about rotorcraft at an industry conference not far from the crash site. The Helicopter Association International's (HAI) Heli-Expo trade show took place this year in Anaheim, California, a short drive from Bryant's home in Newport Beach. His Sikorsky S-76B helicopter took off from nearby John Wayne Airport, and crashed about 40nm (75km) north in Calabasas. Nine people, including Bryant, were killed when his VIP helicopter went down in a hilly region northwest of Los Angeles on 26 January. The helicopter was flying in thick fog, though investigators have yet to conclude what caused the crash. Bryant's well-known use of helicopter commuting around Southern California puts HAI in an awkward spot. The trade organisation is trying to usher in greater public acceptance of urban helicopter commuting. HAI noted its top priorities include the need to maintain access to airports and heliports which are threatened by public complaints about noise and safety fears, especially in New York City, Los Angeles and Hawaii. Maintaining helicopter access and public acceptance could be important in helping to introduce electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft. HAI president and chief executive officer James Viola, who started his role as head of the trade organisation 10 days before Bryant's crash, on 16 January, was quick to note that his deepest sympathies are with the Bryant family, and to point to the need for continuous pilot safety education. “The high profile incidents and accident certainly bring more visibility, not in the positive way, for the industry,” says Viola. “No loss of life is acceptable. We all agree with that.” While helicopter accidents are not unheard of, the death of Bryant, especially in such proximity, brought the issue of helicopter safety to the forefront of Heli-Expo's exhibitors agenda. It was hard to avoid the issue as freeways surrounding the helicopter conference were flanked with digital billboards projecting “Kobe 4 Ever.” Before Viola spoke in his first press conference as HAI president a moment of silence was observed. S-76B manufacturer Sikorsky issued a statement of condolences. Turboshaft manufacturer Honeywell said it would postpone its helicopter purchase outlook until further notice due to “sensitivities”. Correction and update: The article was corrected to note that HAI president and chief executive officer James Viola, started his role as head of the trade organisation 10 days before Bryant's crash, on 16 January.

Meteorological data released by the inquiry points to winds from 280° at 6kt, which would be consisted with runway 31 being preferable, and suggests a tailwind component of about 5kt for aircraft using runway 13. Both runway directions are equipped with VOR/DME navigation aids, the Civil Aviation Organisation indicates. It states that the MD-83 overran and came to rest on a highway about 100m beyond the runway's paved area. The aircraft, operating as flight 6936, had been chartered by the petrochemicals firm Mahshahr Non-Industrial Operations, says the inquiry, and departed Tehran Mehrabad's runway 29L at 06:42 with 136 passengers and eight crew members. It cruised at 32,000ft during the course of its 50min flight before conducting its approach to runway 13 and touching down at 07:36, before striking a perimeter fence and coming to a halt blocking the road. Emergency services attended the scene but all 144 occupants survived, says the inquiry, with only two suffering minor injuries. The aircraft was badly damaged. While the weather data has still to be fully analysed, it states, it has obtained information indicating good visibility at the time of the accident. Images from the scene show the thrust reversers on the Pratt & Whitney JT8D engines in the stowed position. The inquiry has yet to indicate whether they were deployed during the landing. The MD-83's fuel has been drained and the twinjet transferred to another location. Caspian Airlines acquired the aircraft (EP-CPZ) in 2012, according to Cirium fleets data. It had previously been registered with the fleets of Ukrainian company Khors, as well as operators including Air Burkina, Avianca, Jetsgo and Air Liberte.",1,774,7.0,0.4756,"crew, runway, inquiry, land, approach, accident, investigator, captain, incident, pilot","['preliminary', 'information', 'iranian', 'accident', 'investigator', 'indicates', 'crew', 'caspian', 'request', 'land', 'opposite', 'direction', 'runway', 'use', 'jet', 'overran', 'mahshahr', 'civil', 'organisation', 'say', 'pilot', 'notify', 'runway', 'use', 'pilot', 'request', 'land', 'oppositedirection', 'runway', 'meteorological', 'data', 'release', 'inquiry', 'point', 'wind', 'consist', 'runway', 'preferable', 'suggests', 'tailwind', 'component', 'use', 'runway', 'runway', 'direction', 'equip', 'navigation', 'aid', 'civil', 'organisation', 'indicates', 'state', 'overran', 'come', 'rest', 'highway', 'beyond', 'runway', 'pave', 'area', 'operating', 'charter', 'petrochemical', 'firm', 'mahshahr', 'nonindustrial', 'operation', 'say', 'inquiry', 'depart', 'tehran', 'mehrabad', 'runway', 'passenger', 'crew', 'member', 'cruise', 'course', 'conduct', 'approach', 'runway', 'touch', 'strike', 'perimeter', 'fence', 'come', 'halt', 'block', 'road', 'emergency', 'service', 'attend', 'scene', 'occupant', 'survive', 'say', 'inquiry', 'suffer', 'minor', 'injury', 'badly', 'damage', 'weather', 'data', 'still', 'fully', 'analyse', 'state', 'obtain', 'information', 'indicate', 'good', 'visibility', 'accident', 'image', 'scene', 'thrust', 'reversers', 'pratt', 'whitney', 'engine', 'stow', 'position', 'inquiry', 'yet', 'indicate', 'whether', 'deployed', 'land', 'fuel', 'drain', 'twinjet', 'transfer', 'another', 'location', 'caspian', 'acquire', 'epcpz', 'accord', 'fleet', 'data', 'previously', 'register', 'fleet', 'ukrainian', 'khors', 'well', 'operator', 'include', 'burkina', 'avianca', 'jetsgo', 'liberte']"
"Foreseeing a day in the not-too-distant future when pilotless helicopters may fly to people in need of rescue, Collins Aerospace's next generation hoist, the Pegasus, will have the ability to be controlled digitally – even eventually wirelessly. The company anticipates the Pegasus will enter production in 2021 and doesn't foresee it being used on an autonomous helicopter anytime soon. However, with customers testing autonomous helicopters, such as Sikorsky's S-70 Black Hawk Optionally Piloted Vehicle, Collins wants to be prepared. “These hoists are in operation for decades,” says Samir Mehta, president of mechanical systems with Collins Aerospace. “And so, what we're doing is building in the ability for the hoist to be able to perform that kind of mission in the future.” In the near term, the ability to digitally control the Pegasus hoist could allow multiple people to operate the hardware, including pilots in the cockpit who could use an app to take over control should the primary operator become preoccupied, says Mehta. A digitally controlled hoist also collects a lot of data about its operational history and health. For example, the Pegasus will be able to track its load, speed, cycles and temperatures, says Mehta. That extra information spinning off the hoist could help operators avoid overheating, a problem which can damage the machine. Overheating can also force cooling off time, a major problem during busy, high-tempo periods of repeated rescues, such as during a nature disaster. Ultimately, the company is hoping the digital technology it is incorporating into Pegasus will allow it to be used more often, while avoiding unnecessary maintenance. “If you provide it with a digital backbone, you get closer towards condition-based maintenance,” says Mehta. “Now, you're really only changing parts, components and assemblies when they need to be changed, not necessarily based upon some sort of predetermine overhaul or when the part actually fails.”",1,775,1.0,0.3485,"test, force, helicopter, fire, system, service, attack, design, usaf, missile","['foresee', 'day', 'nottoodistant', 'future', 'pilotless', 'helicopter', 'may', 'fly', 'people', 'need', 'rescue', 'collins', 'next', 'generation', 'hoist', 'pegasus', 'ability', 'control', 'digitally', 'even', 'eventually', 'wirelessly', 'anticipates', 'pegasus', 'enter', 'production', 'foresee', 'use', 'autonomous', 'helicopter', 'anytime', 'soon', 'however', 'customer', 'test', 'autonomous', 'helicopter', 'sikorsky', 'black', 'hawk', 'optionally', 'pilot', 'vehicle', 'collins', 'want', 'prepared', 'hoist', 'operation', 'decade', 'say', 'samir', 'mehta', 'president', 'mechanical', 'system', 'collins', 'building', 'ability', 'hoist', 'able', 'perform', 'kind', 'mission', 'near', 'term', 'ability', 'digitally', 'control', 'pegasus', 'hoist', 'allow', 'multiple', 'people', 'operate', 'hardware', 'include', 'pilot', 'cockpit', 'use', 'app', 'take', 'control', 'primary', 'operator', 'become', 'preoccupy', 'say', 'mehta', 'digitally', 'control', 'hoist', 'collect', 'lot', 'data', 'operational', 'history', 'health', 'example', 'pegasus', 'able', 'track', 'load', 'speed', 'cycle', 'temperature', 'say', 'mehta', 'extra', 'information', 'spin', 'hoist', 'help', 'operator', 'avoid', 'overheat', 'problem', 'damage', 'machine', 'overheat', 'force', 'cool', 'major', 'problem', 'busy', 'hightempo', 'period', 'repeat', 'rescue', 'nature', 'disaster', 'ultimately', 'hop', 'digital', 'technology', 'incorporate', 'pegasus', 'allow', 'use', 'often', 'avoid', 'unnecessary', 'maintenance', 'provide', 'digital', 'backbone', 'get', 'closer', 'towards', 'conditionbased', 'maintenance', 'say', 'mehta', 'really', 'change', 'part', 'component', 'assembly', 'need', 'change', 'necessarily', 'base', 'upon', 'sort', 'predetermine', 'overhaul', 'part', 'actually', 'fails']"
"Universal Avionics believes that a lack of helicopter pilots in the future will mean operators will increasingly need to rely on solo pilots aided by automated technologies, such as helmets with augmented reality glasses, to handle workloads while flying missions. Such needs will likely drive a boom in heads-up and wearable display sales, says the company. In response, the firm is pushing greater integration between its various avionics systems and its SkyLens Head Wearable Display, using software to automatically place flight information in front of the pilot's eyes. For example, the company combined its augmented reality helmet with its Interactive Flight Management System, a combination which allows pilots to see projected waypoints and other flight navigation information without having to look down at a helicopter's flight instruments. While helmet-mounted displays are nothing new, Universal Avionics says it wants to use its knowledge of military augmented reality displays, including experience gathered from its parent company Elbit Systems, to advance the technology and capture a large share of the market in the commercial helicopter sector. The company has also pushed the technology via a research partnership with the Federal Aviation Administration that is aimed at developing new regulations for the technology. Universal Avionics believes early adopters of such technology will be helicopter operators flying special missions, including emergency medical services, law enforcement, customs and border patrol, firefighting and search and rescue. Helicopters that fly in degraded visual environments such as at dusk, at night, in poor weather or in smoky conditions will likely be at the front of the pack. “Helicopters are now more and more single pilot on complex operations,” says Tal Golan, rotorcraft business development manager for Universal Avionics. Golan believes helicopter operators will lead adoption of heads-up displays because the piloting demands of rotorcraft are so much more rigorous than fixed-wing aircraft. “The whole idea of heads-up display is to be able to maintain your eyes out or heads up in critical phases of flight,” he says. “For helicopters, critical phases of flight are a higher percentage than fixed-wing.” However, while helicopters might represent the leading edge of helmeted-mounted display adoption Golan believes similar pilot shortages in the commercial transport industry may force operators to also fly with fewer pilots, eventually requiring automated systems like helmet-mounted displays to help handle the greater workload.",1,776,1.0,0.4688,"test, force, helicopter, fire, system, service, attack, design, usaf, missile","['universal', 'avionics', 'believe', 'lack', 'helicopter', 'pilot', 'future', 'mean', 'operator', 'increasingly', 'need', 'rely', 'solo', 'pilot', 'aid', 'automate', 'technology', 'helmet', 'augment', 'reality', 'glass', 'handle', 'workload', 'fly', 'mission', 'need', 'likely', 'drive', 'boom', 'headsup', 'wearable', 'display', 'sale', 'say', 'response', 'firm', 'push', 'great', 'integration', 'various', 'avionics', 'system', 'skylens', 'head', 'wearable', 'display', 'use', 'software', 'automatically', 'place', 'information', 'front', 'pilot', 'eye', 'example', 'combine', 'augment', 'reality', 'helmet', 'interactive', 'management', 'system', 'combination', 'allows', 'pilot', 'see', 'project', 'waypoints', 'navigation', 'information', 'without', 'look', 'helicopter', 'instrument', 'helmetmounted', 'display', 'nothing', 'universal', 'avionics', 'say', 'want', 'use', 'knowledge', 'military', 'augment', 'reality', 'display', 'include', 'experience', 'gather', 'parent', 'elbit', 'system', 'advance', 'technology', 'capture', 'large', 'share', 'market', 'commercial', 'helicopter', 'sector', 'push', 'technology', 'via', 'research', 'partnership', 'federal', 'administration', 'aim', 'develop', 'regulation', 'technology', 'universal', 'avionics', 'believe', 'early', 'adopter', 'technology', 'helicopter', 'operator', 'fly', 'special', 'mission', 'include', 'emergency', 'medical', 'service', 'law', 'enforcement', 'custom', 'border', 'patrol', 'firefighting', 'search', 'rescue', 'helicopter', 'fly', 'degrade', 'visual', 'environment', 'dusk', 'night', 'poor', 'weather', 'smoky', 'condition', 'likely', 'front', 'pack', 'helicopter', 'single', 'pilot', 'complex', 'operation', 'say', 'tal', 'golan', 'rotorcraft', 'business', 'development', 'manager', 'universal', 'avionics', 'golan', 'believe', 'helicopter', 'operator', 'lead', 'adoption', 'headsup', 'display', 'pilot', 'demand', 'rotorcraft', 'much', 'rigorous', 'fixedwing', 'whole', 'idea', 'headsup', 'display', 'able', 'maintain', 'eye', 'head', 'critical', 'phase', 'say', 'helicopter', 'critical', 'phase', 'high', 'percentage', 'however', 'helicopter', 'might', 'represent', 'lead', 'edge', 'helmetedmounted', 'display', 'adoption', 'golan', 'believe', 'similar', 'pilot', 'shortage', 'commercial', 'transport', 'industry', 'may', 'force', 'operator', 'fly', 'pilot', 'eventually', 'require', 'automate', 'system', 'like', 'helmetmounted', 'display', 'help', 'handle', 'great', 'workload']"
"Iranian authorities have dispatched a team of investigators to the scene of a Caspian Airlines Boeing MD-83 accident in which the aircraft suffered a runway overrun. The twinjet came to rest on a highway apparently off the southern end of the 2,400m runway 13 at Mahshahr airport, located near the northern shore of the Persian Gulf. It had been operating a service from Tehran with 135 passengers and seven crew, and touched down at 07:50 according to the Iranian Civil Aviation Organisation. “After landing it exited the runway,” the authority adds. Images from the scene show the aircraft came to rest on its fuselage, blocking the highway, which runs through Mahshahr and connects it with the petrochemical city of Abadan. Video footage shows passengers evacuating from various exits. Meteorological data for the time of the accident suggest good visibility and no adverse weather, although winds from 280-290° would indicate a tailwind component for runway 13. “The situation of the aircraft's leaving the runway is under investigation,” says the Civil Aviation Organisation, adding that the jet departed Tehran at 06:45. Caspian Airlines has confirmed the airframe involved is EP-CPZ, which Cirium fleets data lists as an MD-83 originally delivered to Air Liberte in 1994. It states that 136 passengers were on board and all of them are “in good health”. The aircraft, it says, was operating flight IV6936.

"Europe's safety regulator is concerned that crews are not being given full information on use of collision-avoidance systems to maintain safe separation, to the point where pilots might disregard their instructions. The European Union Aviation Safety Agency says some aircraft flight manuals and operating manuals “do not provide adequate information” on separation procedures from nearby aircraft. “In some cases the flight crew may interpret the available information...as authorisation to disregard a [conflict resolution advisory] based on their visual perception of the situation,” says EASA in a safety bulletin. It points out that standard regulations require immediate crew response to such advisories, adding that a timely response is the “most important single factor” affecting the performance of collision-avoidance systems. “Visually acquired traffic may not be the same traffic causing [the advisory],” warns the bulletin, adding that disregarding instructions will reduce safety levels. “The visual perception of an encounter may be misleading, particularly at night.” EASA says it intends to monitor the situation and could consider further action. But for the time being it is recommending that interim measures be taken including reviewing and updating aircraft flight manuals to ensure that “no credit” is given to visual acquisition of traffic by the crew which “may be in contradiction” with alerts from a resolution advisory.",1,778,11.0,0.2786,"pilot, faa, issue, safety, include, report, require, training, ground, order","['europe', 'safety', 'regulator', 'concerned', 'crew', 'give', 'full', 'information', 'use', 'collisionavoidance', 'system', 'maintain', 'safe', 'separation', 'point', 'pilot', 'might', 'disregard', 'instruction', 'european', 'union', 'safety', 'agency', 'say', 'manual', 'operating', 'manual', 'provide', 'adequate', 'information', 'separation', 'procedure', 'nearby', 'case', 'crew', 'may', 'interpret', 'available', 'information', 'authorisation', 'disregard', 'conflict', 'resolution', 'advisory', 'base', 'visual', 'perception', 'situation', 'say', 'easa', 'safety', 'bulletin', 'point', 'standard', 'regulation', 'require', 'immediate', 'crew', 'response', 'advisory', 'add', 'timely', 'response', 'important', 'single', 'factor', 'affect', 'performance', 'collisionavoidance', 'system', 'visually', 'acquire', 'traffic', 'may', 'traffic', 'cause', 'advisory', 'warns', 'bulletin', 'add', 'disregard', 'instruction', 'reduce', 'safety', 'level', 'visual', 'perception', 'encounter', 'may', 'mislead', 'particularly', 'easa', 'say', 'intend', 'monitor', 'situation', 'consider', 'far', 'action', 'recommend', 'interim', 'measure', 'take', 'include', 'review', 'update', 'manual', 'ensure', 'credit', 'give', 'visual', 'acquisition', 'traffic', 'crew', 'may', 'contradiction', 'alert', 'resolution', 'advisory']"
"Third time's a charm. After two thwarted attempts, Boeing's flight test 777X lifted off from Paine Field on 25 January. It is scheduled to land after a flight of several hours at Boeing Field, south of Seattle. The take-off commences the long-awaited start of the 777X's delayed flight test programme – great news for Boeing, a company wracked in the last year by the 737 Max grounding.  Boeing's 777X took off for the first time on 25 January, from Paine Field. With the 777-9 airborne, the aircraft programme enters the critical flight-test phase. Boeing initially intended to begin flight testing in 2019 and to achieve certification in 2020, but an issue with the 777X's GE Aviation GE9X turbofan last year pushed flight testing into 2020. That issue involved stator vanes in the GE9X's high-pressure compressor and resulting hotter-than-expected exhaust gas temperatures, which was causing premature degradation of components. GE recalled four GE9X engines from Boeing last year and has said it fixed the issue. Launched by Boeing at the Dubai air show in 2013, the 777X is an upgraded version of the 777, an extremely successful fly-by-wire airliner that some analysts and former Boeing engineers say represents the pinnacle of the company's engineering might. Boeing used then-advanced software to design the 777, in the process transforming its development processes. The 777 also ushered in an era of ultra-long-range twin-jet flights. Boeing has delivered 1,479 777s since it handed over the first of the type to United Airlines in 1995, its data shows. The 777X builds off that success. The new variant has a 10cm (4in) wider cabin, more seating capacity, composite wings with folding tips, and 10% greater fuel efficiency, according to Boeing. The 777-9, the first 777X variant to be developed, is 76.7m long – about 3m longer than its predecessor, the 777-300ER. The 777-9 will have 7,300nm (13,500km) range and capacity for 426 passengers in two classes, compared with the 777-300ER's 7,370nm range and 396-passenger capacity. Boeing intends to develop a smaller 777X variant called the 777-8, but last year paused that development for an unspecified period. Boeing says the 777-8 will be 69.8m long, carry 384 passengers and have 8,730nm range. By comparison, the predecessor 777-200 is about 6m shorter, carries 317 passengers and has 8,555nm range, Boeing's figures show.

"Boeing's first 777X flight-test aircraft has lifted off from Paine Field, north of Seattle, kicking off a certification campaign for the twinjet family. The 777-9 took off on 25 January, a day after gusting winds and poor weather forced the abandonment of a previous first-flight attempt. The test aircraft had held at the threshold of Runway 34L for nearly 3.5h, waiting for the wind to settle, but it never did. The first flight finally commences the revamped widebody's delayed flight-test programme and potentially keeps the airframer on track to begin deliveries in early 2021.

"After a several-hour tarmac hold, Boeing scrapped the planned first flight of its 777X on 24 January due to high winds. The company now says it will try again for first flight tomorrow, on 25 January. It was the second straight day weather derailed Boeing's plan to have its next-generation widebody show the world the underside of its wings. Boeing had initially anticipated first flight would occur on 23 January, but weather conditions forced a one-day delay. On the morning of the 24th, every indication suggested Boeing would get the 777X in the air. Hundreds of company employees, wrapped in parkas, gathered at Paine Field for the flight, as did members of the media. Boeing also live-webcast the event. The 777X test aircraft, registration N779XW, left a gate at Paine Field shortly after 10:00 local time and taxied, its wings folded up, to the end of runway 34L. Boeing's 777X test aircraft taxis for first flight at Paine Field on 24 January. There, the pilots held short, waiting for the wind to settle. It never did. Puget Sound is just north of Paine Field, and Boeing's test flights takeoff to the north so the aircraft are quickly flying over water, not populated land areas. But the wind on the 24th blew from the south, roughly the same direction as the runway, with gusts up to 33kt. Too much tailwind, Boeing said. At about 13:30, after nearly a 3.5h hold at the end of the runway, Boeing called off the first flight. The aircraft taxied back to a hangar. “We will be prepared to go again tomorrow [at 10:00] should the weather allow,” Boeing says. Boeing had planned for the flight to leave Paine Field, which is north of Seattle, and to land at Boeing Field, south of Seattle.

"Rolls-Royce is investigating further operational issues with Trent 1000 engines, after instances of surges involving certain powerplants – a situation which has triggered a de-pairing order from European regulators. Trent 1000s, which are fitted to Boeing 787s, have already been the subject of several regulatory interventions, particularly as a result of problems with blade durability. But the surge occurrences appear to be a separate issue. “Investigation into the cause [or causes] of these events is ongoing,” says the European Union Aviation Safety Agency. EASA says the engine surges have particularly affected engines which have accumulated a high number of cycles and flight hours. It says there is a risk of dual engine surge, possibly leading to a dual engine shutdown. Rolls-Royce has drawn up a service bulletin giving instructions to de-pair certain engines in order to reduce the risk of a dual surge incident. EASA is mandating this de-pairing scheme through an airworthiness directive which takes effect on 30 January. It says Trent 1000s with over 24,000h or more than 8,000 cycles cannot be paired with a similar engine, but can be paired with engines which have fewer than 17,000h and 5,500 cycles. But engines which have logged both 24,000h and 8,000 cycles can be paired with engines which have reached neither of these thresholds.

"Investigators were still conducting an investigation into two smoke incidents involving the South African Civil Aviation Authority's Cessna Citation II flight-inspection jet before its fatal loss near George. There is no immediate evidence of a connection between the incidents – on 7 and 8 November last year – and the 23 January crash, but the SACAA had yet to reach conclusions on the cause. In its preliminary findings the SACAA said the crew had executed a go-around at Wonderboom airport on 7 November and reported smoke in the cockpit. After landing an inspection of both engines revealed no oil visible on the dipstick of the left-hand Pratt & Whitney JT15D-4 engine. Maintenance personnel performed checks and, after a ground run on both powerplants, signed off the defect and returned the jet to service. But during the take-off roll from Lanseria airport the following day, the crew again experienced smoke in the cockpit and aborted the departure. Both main landing-gear tyres deflated during the incident. The preliminary inquiry does not identify a reason for the smoke incidents – although it says there was no evidence of fire. It states that the Citation's certificate of airworthiness was valid to 30 October 2020. None of the three crew members of the aircraft survived after it crashed in mountainous terrain after taking off from George airport on 23 January.",1,783,7.0,0.3104,"crew, runway, inquiry, land, approach, accident, investigator, captain, incident, pilot","['investigator', 'still', 'conduct', 'investigation', 'smoke', 'incident', 'involve', 'south', 'african', 'civil', 'authority', 'cessna', 'citation', 'ii', 'flightinspection', 'jet', 'fatal', 'loss', 'near', 'george', 'immediate', 'evidence', 'connection', 'incident', 'november', 'january', 'crash', 'sacaa', 'yet', 'reach', 'conclusion', 'cause', 'preliminary', 'finding', 'sacaa', 'say', 'crew', 'execute', 'goaround', 'wonderboom', 'airport', 'november', 'report', 'smoke', 'cockpit', 'land', 'inspection', 'engine', 'reveal', 'oil', 'visible', 'dipstick', 'lefthand', 'pratt', 'whitney', 'engine', 'maintenance', 'personnel', 'perform', 'check', 'ground', 'run', 'powerplants', 'sign', 'defect', 'return', 'jet', 'service', 'takeoff', 'roll', 'lanseria', 'airport', 'follow', 'day', 'crew', 'experienced', 'smoke', 'cockpit', 'aborted', 'departure', 'main', 'landinggear', 'tyre', 'deflate', 'incident', 'preliminary', 'inquiry', 'identify', 'reason', 'smoke', 'incident', 'although', 'say', 'evidence', 'fire', 'state', 'citation', 'certificate', 'airworthiness', 'valid', 'october', 'none', 'crew', 'member', 'survive', 'crashed', 'mountainous', 'terrain', 'take', 'george', 'airport', 'january']"
"French investigators have reiterated that the only strategy to limit injury risk from turbulence is for passengers to keep seat-belts fastened while seated. Investigation authority BEA states that turbulence forecasting is not precise – able to provide only probabilities – and detection of clear-air turbulence is “not possible” with current on-board technology. BEA gave its verdict in its inquiry into a serious turbulence incident involving a Transavia Boeing 737-800 (F-GZHM) operating between Lyon and Tel Aviv on 13 February last year. The captain had expected light to moderate turbulence around 1h 30min after departure. While in the cruise over Montenegro at 37,000ft – about 86min after take-off – the crew was duly informed by air traffic control that the aircraft was entering a region in which turbulence had been reported between 38,000-40,000ft. BEA says the captain advised the cabin crew chief of turbulence in “two or three minutes”, and subsequently illuminated the seat-belt light. The crew reduced airspeed from M0.79 to M0.77. One flight attendant made an announcement to passengers while another began checking seat-belts were fastened. The onset of the turbulence occurred about 1min after the seat-belt light was turned on. BEA says the aircraft experienced moderate turbulence for about 10s, with the air current changing from 35kt tailwind to a 11kt headwind, while the lateral component from the left dropped from 77kt to 50kt. Vertical load factor fluctuated between 0.52g and 1.7g. Airspeed increased sharply, says the inquiry, and an overspeed alarm was triggered. The first officer, who was flying, deployed speedbrakes just before the turbulence intensified for 6s, with vertical loads changing from negative 0.7g, to 1.71g, then back to negative 0.32g. The aircraft rolled up to 37° left at a rate of up to 38°/s. BEA says the captain took control of the aircraft from the first officer and rolled the aircraft level, before commencing a descent to 35,000ft. Cabin crew had not had time to prepare for the sudden turbulence and, while two members were able to find seats, two others were twice thrown towards the ceiling. “Unbuckled passengers, seated towards the rear of the cabin, were also thrown upwards and struck the luggage compartments,” the inquiry says. BEA says the incident injured two flight attendants and eight passengers. But the crew, having assessed the aircraft and the condition of those on board, opted to proceed to the destination. The crew had been unaware of forecasts of strong turbulence on the route, because they did not have the latest information to hand, and were not familiar with colour coding on a weather application. But BEA points out that turbulence forecasting remains an inexact field, and that – in the event of unforeseen turbulence – crews should use an emergency instruction to issue a warning to cabin crew and order an immediate fastening of seat-belts. It notes that the “very short interval” between the pilots' initial advisory to cabin crew and the onset of turbulence meant there was insufficient time to conduct a full cabin check. There is an “intrinsic limitation” to procedures relating to unforeseen turbulence, it states, and the best defence against injury is for passengers to keep seat-belts fastened during flight.",1,784,7.0,0.5104,"crew, runway, inquiry, land, approach, accident, investigator, captain, incident, pilot","['french', 'investigator', 'reiterate', 'strategy', 'limit', 'injury', 'risk', 'turbulence', 'passenger', 'keep', 'seatbelt', 'fasten', 'seat', 'investigation', 'authority', 'bea', 'state', 'turbulence', 'forecasting', 'precise', 'able', 'provide', 'probability', 'detection', 'clearair', 'turbulence', 'possible', 'current', 'onboard', 'technology', 'bea', 'give', 'verdict', 'inquiry', 'serious', 'turbulence', 'incident', 'involve', 'transavia', 'fgzhm', 'operating', 'lyon', 'tel', 'aviv', 'february', 'captain', 'expect', 'light', 'moderate', 'turbulence', 'around', 'departure', 'cruise', 'montenegro', 'takeoff', 'crew', 'duly', 'inform', 'traffic', 'control', 'enter', 'region', 'turbulence', 'report', 'bea', 'say', 'captain', 'advise', 'cabin', 'crew', 'chief', 'turbulence', 'minute', 'subsequently', 'illuminate', 'seatbelt', 'light', 'crew', 'reduce', 'airspeed', 'attendant', 'make', 'announcement', 'passenger', 'another', 'begin', 'check', 'seatbelt', 'fasten', 'onset', 'turbulence', 'occur', 'seatbelt', 'light', 'turn', 'bea', 'say', 'experienced', 'moderate', 'turbulence', 'current', 'change', 'tailwind', 'headwind', 'lateral', 'component', 'left', 'drop', 'vertical', 'load', 'factor', 'fluctuate', 'airspeed', 'increase', 'sharply', 'say', 'inquiry', 'overspeed', 'alarm', 'trigger', 'officer', 'fly', 'deployed', 'speedbrakes', 'turbulence', 'intensified', 'vertical', 'load', 'change', 'negative', 'back', 'negative', 'roll', 'left', 'rate', 'bea', 'say', 'captain', 'take', 'control', 'officer', 'roll', 'level', 'commence', 'descent', 'cabin', 'crew', 'prepare', 'sudden', 'turbulence', 'member', 'able', 'find', 'seat', 'others', 'twice', 'thrown', 'towards', 'ceiling', 'unbuckled', 'passenger', 'seat', 'towards', 'rear', 'cabin', 'thrown', 'upwards', 'struck', 'luggage', 'compartment', 'inquiry', 'say', 'bea', 'say', 'incident', 'injured', 'attendant', 'passenger', 'crew', 'assess', 'condition', 'board', 'opt', 'proceed', 'destination', 'crew', 'unaware', 'forecast', 'strong', 'turbulence', 'route', 'late', 'information', 'hand', 'familiar', 'colour', 'cod', 'weather', 'application', 'bea', 'point', 'turbulence', 'forecasting', 'remains', 'inexact', 'field', 'event', 'unforeseen', 'turbulence', 'crew', 'use', 'emergency', 'instruction', 'issue', 'warn', 'cabin', 'crew', 'order', 'immediate', 'fasten', 'seatbelt', 'note', 'short', 'interval', 'pilot', 'initial', 'advisory', 'cabin', 'crew', 'onset', 'turbulence', 'meant', 'insufficient', 'conduct', 'full', 'cabin', 'check', 'intrinsic', 'limitation', 'procedure', 'relate', 'unforeseen', 'turbulence', 'state', 'best', 'defence', 'injury', 'passenger', 'keep', 'seatbelt', 'fasten']"
"Four occupants of an Avianca Airbus A319 have been hospitalised after an apparent turbulence incident and a diversion to Panama City. The aircraft had been operating the AV693 service from San Jose to Bogota on 23 January, says the carrier. Diversion of the flight, which had been operating at 35,000ft, occurred as it reached the Panama-Colombia border. Avianca says the diversion followed the crew's receiving an “alert” from the aircraft's systems, without elaborating on the nature of the alarm. It was transporting 108 passengers and five crew members but states that the aircraft experienced “abrupt movement”, prompting medical referrals for some of those on board when it arrived in Panama. Avianca says that, as a result of initial reviews, three crew members and a passenger were taken to hospital for more detailed examination. The airline has not clarified whether the alert, the diversion and the turbulence were directly connected.

"European regulators are looking into alternative measures to mitigate an apparent safety risk relating to Boeing 727 auxiliary fuel tanks, after opting not to adopt a US FAA directive on the matter. The directive, to which Boeing had objected, argues that the fuel-quantity indicating system presents a potential electrical ignition source, and orders operators to modify the system or de-activate the tanks. But the European Union Aviation Safety Agency says it is “not in possession of sufficient data” which would allow it to determine whether an unsafe condition exists, and therefore support proportionate corrective measures. “Consequently, there is insufficient justification to warrant the actions as required by [the US directive],” it adds. The directive is due to take effect on 4 February. EASA says, however, that it is considering possible alternative actions to mitigate any safety risk for aircraft operating under European regulations. It has not indicated how many 727s with auxiliary tanks fall within this jurisdiction but states it will co-ordinate with the design approval holder and the FAA, in order to obtain additional data.",1,786,6.0,0.2749,"engine, maintenance, fuel, takeoff, result, failure, system, problem, power, issue","['european', 'regulator', 'look', 'alternative', 'measure', 'mitigate', 'apparent', 'safety', 'risk', 'relate', 'auxiliary', 'fuel', 'tank', 'opt', 'adopt', 'u', 'faa', 'directive', 'matter', 'directive', 'object', 'argues', 'fuelquantity', 'indicate', 'system', 'present', 'potential', 'electrical', 'ignition', 'source', 'order', 'operator', 'modify', 'system', 'deactivate', 'tank', 'european', 'union', 'safety', 'agency', 'say', 'possession', 'sufficient', 'data', 'allow', 'determine', 'whether', 'unsafe', 'condition', 'exists', 'therefore', 'support', 'proportionate', 'corrective', 'measure', 'consequently', 'insufficient', 'justification', 'warrant', 'action', 'require', 'u', 'directive', 'add', 'directive', 'due', 'take', 'effect', 'february', 'easa', 'say', 'however', 'consider', 'possible', 'alternative', 'action', 'mitigate', 'safety', 'risk', 'operating', 'european', 'regulation', 'indicate', 'many', 'auxiliary', 'tank', 'fall', 'within', 'jurisdiction', 'state', 'coordinate', 'design', 'approval', 'holder', 'faa', 'order', 'obtain', 'additional', 'data']"
"NokScoot has obtained a Bt200 million ($6.56 million) loan from a major shareholder of Nok Air in the form of a promissory note. This was issued by Hatairatn Jurangkool, who owns 24.4% of Nok and is the mother of Nok's chief executive, Wutthiphoom Jurangkool. In a disclosure to the Stock Exchange of Thailand, Nok says the one-year note was issued on 12 December 2019 and will be used by NokScoot for working capital and general operation purposes. The shareholder loan was approved at Nok's board meeting held on 23 January. The loan carries an interest of 6.3%, which is below the average minimum loan rate of 6.93% offered by locally registered commercial banks. No collateral was required from NokScoot. “The interest rate is adjacent to financial institution's interest rate and flexible to manage the subsidiary's liquidity and match with the cash flow projection plan,” Nok says. Nok Air and Singapore's Scoot each own a 49% stake in NokScoot, while the remaining 2% is held by Pueannammitr Company, a firm that represents four Nok Air representatives. In 2018, NokScoot received a Bt1 billion capital injection from the three companies. For the third quarter of 2019, NokScoot posted a larger operating loss of Bt593 million, having added two Boeing 777-200s to its fleet.

"Southwest Airlines says that it lost almost a billion dollars in operating income due to the grounding of the Boeing 737 Max aircraft, as it joins other airlines in scrambling to find capacity and make up for the jet's ongoing problems. “I am confident about the Max, and our pilots are confident about the Max,” chief executive Gary Kelly tells analysts on the company's earnings call on 23 January. “The timing remains uncertain, and we are working through all that right now.”  Kelly says that 2019 full-year operating profit was $828 million – or 28% - lower than had the Max been flying in the airline's all-737 fleet. “The grounding of 75 of our airplanes, or about ten percent of our fleet, presents a crisis-like challenge for our team.” The Dallas-based carrier's net profit in the full year 2019 fell to $2.3 billion from $2.4 billion in 2018. In the final quarter of 2019, net profit hit $514 million, down 21% from $654 million in the same quarter a year ago. Full-year revenues rose to $22.4 billion from $21.9 billion, up 2.1%. In the fourth quarter alone, Southwest had revenue of $5.7 billion, flat from the year-ago quarter. The airline has taken the aircraft out of its schedule until 6 June, but will likely have to extend that as more information becomes available, executives say. In order to reduce some of the fleet deficit created by the lack of the newer generation, lower-fuel burn 737 Max aircraft, the airline is planning on postponing 7 of 18 retirements of older 737-700 aircraft this year. These will fly 2 more years, chief financial officer Tammy Romo says. “We are also monitoring the used 737 aircraft market because seat growth is not keeping up with demand and we are losing share,” Kelly says. “We plan to aggressively recapture that once the Max is ungrounded.” Currently, Southwest is not looking to lease additional aircraft, he adds. “Everything is predicated on our assumption that this is a short-lived issue, and not something that we will have to deal with for years.” Southwest currently has 34 Max aircraft in its fleet, all of which are in storage in Victorville, California. It had had expected to have about 75 Max in the fleet at the end of 2019, and another 38 deliveries of the aircraft in 2020. At the moment, all of these plans are on hold. The airline has settled with Boeing for an undisclosed amount for the 2019 losses, but hopes to come to another agreement for 2020. Kelly says he is “pleased” with the confidential compensation agreement Southwest and Boeing have signed for last year's losses, and the airline is continuing discussions with the plane-maker. “There were years when we had a dozen problems to solve. Right now we have one problem, and it's a serious one,” Kelly says. “Dogpaddling for a year has cost us customers. It's not anything we can mitigate until we get airplanes and can grow again. Do I think we've been harmed? Absolutely. Everyone knows we will seek further compensation from Boeing,” he adds. Chief operations officer Mike Van de Ven says that the airline's 34 stored Max will have to go through some maintenance work before they are once again ready to go into revenue service. 27 further aircraft have been built and are being stored at Boeing facilities. “So these 61 aircraft are our most reliable source of lift this year,” Van de Ven says. “We can manage around 5-10 aircraft a week to be reintroduced to the operation.” That said, these estimates may change as the airline assesses what will be required to get the aircraft back into service. Manual updates, pilot training and maintenance needs of the jets may require more time than currently expected and from the time that the aircraft is re-certificated, “that will add at least a couple of months to the time to get the aircraft operating.” While the requirements for pilot and training are not yet clear, Van de Ven says the airline currently has three Max simulators, it is awaiting three more before the end of the summer, and another three by the end of the year. Assuming a 2-hour simulator training session for each pilot, that capacity will allow all of Southwest's pilots to complete the training prerequisites within a few months. “The FAA is in control of the ungrounding process. Our plans are from that date,” Van de Ven says. HAWAII FLIGHTS One bright spot for the company i n2019 was its ambitious and aggressive foray into the US mainland-to-Hawaii market, which it launched last March. It currently offers 28 flights between four cities in California – San Jose, San Diego, Sacramento and Oakland – and several islands in the Pacific archipelago. In addition, it has opened an extensive interisland network as a direct challenge to Hawaiian Airlines' domination of the region. “Those routes are doing phenomenally and succeeding in every dimension,” the airline's president Tom Nealon says, adding though that the ramp up has been slower than expected because of the Max and capacity bottlenecks. “These flights are creating demand that we didn't see was there. We are now seeing more connecting itineraries on the west coast, and fares are lower. That is the classic Southwest effect.” While Hawaii service is still just two percent of the airline's overall revenue, customer ratings of the service is higher than on most other routes, he says. On Thursday, The Wall Street Journal reported that the FAA may have given Southwest preferential treatment when it authorized the carrier's Hawaii routes a year ago. The report says that a whistleblower alleged that FAA managers engaged in “gross mismanagement and abuse of authority” for “the financial benefit of the airline,” according to a report from the Office of Special Counsel. “We don't know what that's about,” chief executive Kelly says on Thursday. “This is a whistleblower complaint, we don't know what the complaint is or who the whistleblower is. It certainly doesn't feel like we got preferential treatment, though.” Executives say the airline went through a rigorous 14-month approval process before it began operating the flights. “It's all a surprise to us and if there are issues, we don't know what it's about,” Van de Ven added. The FAA said earlier today that it is investigating the matter.",1,788,11.0,0.2914,"pilot, faa, issue, safety, include, report, require, training, ground, order","['southwest', 'say', 'lose', 'almost', 'dollar', 'operating', 'income', 'due', 'ground', 'join', 'scramble', 'find', 'capacity', 'make', 'jet', 'ongoing', 'problem', 'confident', 'pilot', 'confident', 'chief', 'executive', 'gary', 'kelly', 'tell', 'analyst', 'earnings', 'call', 'january', 'timing', 'remains', 'uncertain', 'work', 'right', 'kelly', 'say', 'fullyear', 'operating', 'profit', 'low', 'fly', 'fleet', 'ground', 'airplane', 'percent', 'fleet', 'present', 'crisislike', 'challenge', 'dallasbased', 'carrier', 'net', 'profit', 'full', 'fell', 'final', 'quarter', 'net', 'profit', 'hit', 'quarter', 'ago', 'fullyear', 'revenue', 'rise', 'fourth', 'quarter', 'alone', 'southwest', 'revenue', 'flat', 'yearago', 'quarter', 'take', 'schedule', 'june', 'likely', 'extend', 'information', 'becomes', 'available', 'executive', 'say', 'order', 'reduce', 'fleet', 'deficit', 'create', 'lack', 'newer', 'generation', 'lowerfuel', 'burn', 'planning', 'postpone', 'retirement', 'old', 'fly', 'chief', 'financial', 'officer', 'tammy', 'romo', 'say', 'monitoring', 'use', 'market', 'seat', 'growth', 'keep', 'demand', 'lose', 'share', 'kelly', 'say', 'plan', 'aggressively', 'recapture', 'currently', 'southwest', 'look', 'lease', 'additional', 'add', 'everything', 'predicate', 'assumption', 'shortlived', 'issue', 'something', 'deal', 'southwest', 'currently', 'fleet', 'storage', 'victorville', 'california', 'expect', 'fleet', 'end', 'another', 'delivery', 'moment', 'plan', 'hold', 'settle', 'undisclosed', 'amount', 'loss', 'hope', 'come', 'another', 'agreement', 'kelly', 'say', 'pleased', 'confidential', 'compensation', 'agreement', 'southwest', 'sign', 'loss', 'continue', 'discussion', 'planemaker', 'dozen', 'problem', 'solve', 'right', 'problem', 'serious', 'kelly', 'say', 'dogpaddling', 'cost', 'u', 'customer', 'anything', 'mitigate', 'get', 'airplane', 'grow', 'think', 'harm', 'absolutely', 'everyone', 'know', 'seek', 'far', 'compensation', 'add', 'chief', 'operation', 'officer', 'mike', 'van', 'de', 'ven', 'say', 'store', 'go', 'maintenance', 'work', 'ready', 'go', 'revenue', 'service', 'far', 'built', 'store', 'facility', 'reliable', 'source', 'lift', 'van', 'de', 'ven', 'say', 'manage', 'around', 'week', 'reintroduce', 'say', 'estimate', 'may', 'change', 'ass', 'require', 'get', 'back', 'service', 'manual', 'update', 'pilot', 'training', 'maintenance', 'need', 'jet', 'may', 'require', 'currently', 'expect', 'recertificated', 'add', 'least', 'couple', 'month', 'get', 'requirement', 'pilot', 'training', 'yet', 'clear', 'van', 'de', 'ven', 'say', 'currently', 'simulator', 'await', 'end', 'summer', 'another', 'end', 'assume', 'simulator', 'training', 'session', 'pilot', 'capacity', 'allow', 'southwest', 'pilot', 'complete', 'training', 'prerequisite', 'within', 'month', 'faa', 'control', 'ungrounding', 'process', 'plan', 'date', 'van', 'de', 'ven', 'say', 'hawaii', 'bright', 'spot', 'ambitious', 'aggressive', 'foray', 'u', 'mainlandtohawaii', 'market', 'launch', 'march', 'currently', 'offer', 'city', 'california', 'san', 'jose', 'san', 'diego', 'sacramento', 'oakland', 'several', 'island', 'pacific', 'archipelago', 'addition', 'open', 'extensive', 'interisland', 'network', 'direct', 'challenge', 'hawaiian', 'domination', 'region', 'route', 'phenomenally', 'succeed', 'every', 'dimension', 'president', 'tom', 'nealon', 'say', 'add', 'though', 'ramp', 'slow', 'expect', 'capacity', 'bottleneck', 'create', 'demand', 'see', 'see', 'connect', 'itinerary', 'west', 'coast', 'fare', 'low', 'classic', 'southwest', 'hawaii', 'service', 'still', 'percent', 'overall', 'revenue', 'customer', 'rating', 'service', 'high', 'route', 'say', 'thursday', 'wall', 'street', 'journal', 'report', 'faa', 'may', 'give', 'southwest', 'preferential', 'treatment', 'authorize', 'carrier', 'hawaii', 'route', 'ago', 'report', 'say', 'whistleblower', 'allege', 'faa', 'manager', 'engage', 'gross', 'mismanagement', 'abuse', 'authority', 'financial', 'benefit', 'accord', 'report', 'office', 'special', 'counsel', 'know', 'chief', 'executive', 'kelly', 'say', 'thursday', 'whistleblower', 'complaint', 'know', 'complaint', 'whistleblower', 'certainly', 'feel', 'like', 'get', 'preferential', 'treatment', 'executive', 'say', 'go', 'rigorous', 'approval', 'process', 'begin', 'operating', 'surprise', 'u', 'issue', 'know', 'van', 'de', 'ven', 'add', 'faa', 'say', 'earlier', 'today', 'investigate', 'matter']"
"An electric system fire significantly damaged a prototype of Israeli company Eviation Aircraft's in-development, all-electric Alice aircraft at an Arizona airport on 22 January. The Prescott Regional airport confirms the nine-passenger Alice prototype was damaged by a fire that started at about 18:30 local time. Though the extent of the damage remains unknown, video of the fire posted online by local media outlet Prescott eNews suggests the prototype suffered extensively. The video shows firefighters dousing the smoking prototype with water or fire extinguishing agent. “Eviation Aircraft experienced a fire incident during system testing of one of its aircraft at the Prescott Regional airport,” the company says in a statement. The incident “is believed to have been caused by a ground-based battery system which was being utilised during rigorous testing of its all-electric airplane”. Eviation has “launched a full investigation” into the incident in concert with the Prescott Fire Department, which was on hand for the test and “quickly extinguished the fire”, Eviation says. Prescott Regional airport director Robin Sobotta confirms the fire damage on the aircraft. Eviation, based in Kadima-Zoran, Israel, did not respond immediately to a request for more information, and the potential impact of the fire on the Alice development programme remains unknown. Eviation had aimed to achieve the first Alice flight this year and certification in 2022. The company assembled the first Alice prototype in northwest France. It shipped a prototype to Prescott for flight testing. Eviation has offices in Prescott, which is about 100 miles (160km) north of Phoenix. Eviation sees an opportunity for Alice to serve small cities that currently lack air service. The aircraft has three pusher propellers – one behind its tail and one on each wingtip – and is designed to carry up to nine passengers and two pilots. It is designed to have a 565nm (1,050km) range at 260kt (482km/h). The company offers two electric-propulsion system options for Alice: US company Magnix's 375hp (280kW) Magni250s, or 349hp motors made by German company Siemens.

"Operators of Rolls-Royce-powered Airbus A380s are set to be ordered to inspect the type's engines for cracking of spacers between intermediate-pressure compressor discs. The European Union Aviation Safety Agency says examination of a Trent 900 rotor shaft revealed a crack in an interstage spacer between the stage two and stage three discs, and that a similar crack was subsequently found – in the same location – on another rotor shaft. “Investigation is ongoing to identify the cause of these cracks,” it states. “It has been determined that more engines could be affected by this cracking phenomenon.” EASA warns that the condition could potentially lead to failure of the intermediate pressure compressor rotor shaft and release of high-energy debris. Rolls-Royce has published inspection instructions and EASA is proposing to mandate the checks through an airworthiness directive. It will require on-wing borescope inspections – for certain engines – within 200 cycles, but will also order repetitive in-shop inspections of the rotor shaft. EASA is also proposing inspection of certain shafts prior to installation. Engines found to have cracks would have to be withdrawn from service before the aircraft's next flight.

"The Federal Aviation Administration says it is investigating reports it gave Southwest Airlines “preferential treatment” when it authorised the airline's routes from the US mainland to Hawaii last year. The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that the US aviation regulator may have acted improperly when it authorised the flights. A letter from the US Office of Special Counsel, a federal investigation agency, concluded a whistleblower's complaint that the FAA rushed the approval process for the flights is credible. “The safety of the flying public is our top priority,” the FAA says in a statement on 23 January. “The matter has been referred to FAA's Office of Audit and Evaluation to investigate the issues raised in the Office of Special Counsel's letter. As the matter is under investigation, we are unable to comment further at this time.” Southwest launched operations to Hawaii in March, and now offers almost 30 connections between four cities in California and the Pacific archipelago every day. In addition, it has opened an extensive interisland network of 38 daily flights that serves as a direct assault on Hawaiian Airlines' dominance in the region. The Dallas-based carrier has said it sees its Hawaii routes as prime growth drivers for the future, and that they have been profitable as the airline continues to deal with the fallout of the grounding of its Boeing 737 Max fleet. “The strong customer response to our Hawaii service supports continued investment in 2020,” the airline says in an earnings report on 23 January. Hawaiian Airlines could not be reached for comment. The Wall Street Journal wrote on Thursday that the whistleblower's complaint alleges FAA managers engaged in “gross mismanagement and abuse of authority” for “the financial benefit of the airline,” according to the counsel's summary. The allegations lead to broader concern about the regulatory body's potential lapses in ensuring safety for the traveling public. It remains under fire for approving items reviewed by Boeing during the certification of the beleaguered 737 Max. That aircraft's grounding, after two crashes killed 346 people, is in its eleventh month. Boeing has said the aircraft won't likely fly again unitil sometime in “mid-2020”. This is not the first time Southwest has faced questions about safety issues. Earlier this month the FAA proposed a $3.9 million fine on the airline for operating 21,505 commercial flights in 2018 with incorrect weight and balance calculations, potentially putting the safety of the flights at risk.",1,791,11.0,0.3817,"pilot, faa, issue, safety, include, report, require, training, ground, order","['federal', 'administration', 'say', 'investigate', 'report', 'give', 'southwest', 'preferential', 'treatment', 'authorise', 'route', 'u', 'mainland', 'hawaii', 'wall', 'street', 'journal', 'report', 'thursday', 'u', 'regulator', 'may', 'act', 'improperly', 'authorise', 'letter', 'u', 'office', 'special', 'counsel', 'federal', 'investigation', 'agency', 'conclude', 'whistleblower', 'complaint', 'faa', 'rush', 'approval', 'process', 'credible', 'safety', 'fly', 'public', 'top', 'priority', 'faa', 'say', 'statement', 'january', 'matter', 'refer', 'faa', 'office', 'audit', 'evaluation', 'investigate', 'issue', 'raise', 'office', 'special', 'counsel', 'letter', 'matter', 'investigation', 'unable', 'comment', 'far', 'southwest', 'launch', 'operation', 'hawaii', 'march', 'offer', 'almost', 'connection', 'city', 'california', 'pacific', 'archipelago', 'every', 'day', 'addition', 'open', 'extensive', 'interisland', 'network', 'daily', 'serf', 'direct', 'assault', 'hawaiian', 'dominance', 'region', 'dallasbased', 'carrier', 'say', 'see', 'hawaii', 'route', 'prime', 'growth', 'driver', 'future', 'profitable', 'continue', 'deal', 'fallout', 'ground', 'fleet', 'strong', 'customer', 'response', 'hawaii', 'service', 'support', 'continued', 'investment', 'say', 'earnings', 'report', 'january', 'hawaiian', 'reach', 'comment', 'wall', 'street', 'journal', 'write', 'thursday', 'whistleblower', 'complaint', 'alleges', 'faa', 'manager', 'engage', 'gross', 'mismanagement', 'abuse', 'authority', 'financial', 'benefit', 'accord', 'counsel', 'summary', 'allegation', 'lead', 'broader', 'concern', 'regulatory', 'body', 'potential', 'lapse', 'ensure', 'safety', 'travel', 'public', 'remains', 'fire', 'approve', 'item', 'review', 'certification', 'beleaguer', 'ground', 'crash', 'kill', 'people', 'eleventh', 'month', 'say', 'wo', 'likely', 'fly', 'unitil', 'sometime', 'southwest', 'face', 'question', 'safety', 'issue', 'earlier', 'month', 'faa', 'propose', 'fine', 'operating', 'commercial', 'incorrect', 'weight', 'balance', 'calculation', 'potentially', 'put', 'safety', 'risk']"
"Several Asian carriers have suspended flights to Wuhan, as the Chinese city is put on lockdown to contain a respiratory virus outbreak. Taiwan's China Airlines is suspending Wuhan flights from Taipei Taoyuan and Taipei Songshan between 23 January and 29 February. Hong Kong-based Cathay Dragon has put all Wuhan flights on hold from 24 January to 29 February. Singapore's Scoot will suspend its daily service to the city from 23 to 26 January.

"UK investigators believe a landing Loganair Embraer ERJ-145 ran over a towbar left on a London Southend airport runway because it did not have any markings to increase its visibility to inspectors. The towbar had been inadvertently left attached to the nose-wheel of a Cessna P210N light aircraft which had departed Southend some 30min earlier. As the Cessna took off from runway 23, the towbar fell off and landed on the runway surface. Two aircraft – a landing Piper PA-28 and a departing Britten-Norman Islander – each used the runway in the time before the ERJ-145 conducted its approach and was cleared to land. The UK Air Accidents Investigation Branch also states that a runway inspection was conducted in the interval between the PA-28's arrival and the Islander's take-off. When the ERJ touched down – in daylight and good visibility – its captain saw an object on the right of the centreline, about 8-10m in front of the aircraft, while the jet was still travelling at 105-110kt. “He applied slight left rudder as the object disappeared out of view,” says the inquiry. “[He] felt a small bump through the rudder pedals but was not sure if this was caused by the aircraft clipping the object or running over the centreline.” After the crew reported the sighting to air traffic control, runway inspection personnel recovered the towbar which was located about 350m from the runway 23 threshold. It had been run over by the ERJ, the inquiry states, but the jet (G-SAJK) was undamaged. Analysis of the event, which occurred on 7 August last year, could not determine whether the PA-28 or Islander had passed the towbar during their runway occupancy, while the runway inspection was intended to check for wildlife – so the inspection vehicle's driver might have been focused on the sky rather than the runway surface. But the inquiry points out that the towbar was painted in dark colours, rendering it “inconspicuous” against the runway surface. “The towbar might have been seen sooner if it had reflective or other high-visibility markings,” it adds. Investigators also note that the Cessna pilot had been distracted en route to the airport by an alarming road traffic incident between his motorcycle and a cyclist. The inquiry suggests this incident pre-occupied the pilot's mind during preparation for flight, and was “probably” behind his forgetting to remove the towbar. The pilot also unintentionally left his bags behind at Southend. Stressful events can be “difficult to put out of mind”, the inquiry warns: “It may be tempting to continue with a planned operation and not realise the effect of such an event on subsequent performance.”",1,793,7.0,0.4849,"crew, runway, inquiry, land, approach, accident, investigator, captain, incident, pilot","['uk', 'investigator', 'believe', 'land', 'loganair', 'embraer', 'ran', 'towbar', 'left', 'london', 'southend', 'airport', 'runway', 'marking', 'increase', 'visibility', 'inspector', 'towbar', 'inadvertently', 'left', 'attach', 'nosewheel', 'cessna', 'light', 'depart', 'southend', 'earlier', 'cessna', 'take', 'runway', 'towbar', 'fell', 'land', 'runway', 'surface', 'land', 'piper', 'depart', 'brittennorman', 'islander', 'use', 'runway', 'conduct', 'approach', 'clear', 'land', 'uk', 'accident', 'investigation', 'branch', 'state', 'runway', 'inspection', 'conduct', 'interval', 'arrival', 'islander', 'takeoff', 'erj', 'touch', 'daylight', 'good', 'visibility', 'captain', 'saw', 'object', 'right', 'centreline', 'front', 'jet', 'still', 'travel', 'apply', 'slight', 'left', 'rudder', 'object', 'disappear', 'view', 'say', 'inquiry', 'felt', 'small', 'bump', 'rudder', 'pedal', 'sure', 'cause', 'clip', 'object', 'run', 'crew', 'report', 'sight', 'traffic', 'control', 'runway', 'inspection', 'personnel', 'recover', 'towbar', 'locate', 'runway', 'threshold', 'run', 'erj', 'inquiry', 'state', 'jet', 'gsajk', 'undamaged', 'analysis', 'event', 'occur', 'august', 'determine', 'whether', 'islander', 'pass', 'towbar', 'runway', 'occupancy', 'runway', 'inspection', 'intend', 'check', 'wildlife', 'inspection', 'vehicle', 'driver', 'might', 'focus', 'sky', 'rather', 'runway', 'surface', 'inquiry', 'point', 'towbar', 'paint', 'dark', 'colour', 'render', 'inconspicuous', 'runway', 'surface', 'towbar', 'might', 'see', 'sooner', 'reflective', 'highvisibility', 'marking', 'add', 'investigator', 'note', 'cessna', 'pilot', 'distract', 'en', 'route', 'airport', 'alarm', 'road', 'traffic', 'incident', 'motorcycle', 'cyclist', 'inquiry', 'suggests', 'incident', 'preoccupy', 'pilot', 'mind', 'preparation', 'probably', 'behind', 'forget', 'remove', 'towbar', 'pilot', 'unintentionally', 'left', 'bag', 'behind', 'southend', 'stressful', 'event', 'difficult', 'put', 'mind', 'inquiry', 'warns', 'may', 'tempt', 'continue', 'plan', 'operation', 'realise', 'effect', 'event', 'subsequent', 'performance']"
"Boeing 737 Max operators are to be instructed to update engine-control software to address a loss of thrust issue, attributed to icing, on the type's CFM International Leap-1B powerplants. At least two occurrences have been investigated which Leap-1Bs suffered temporary loss of thrust control as a result of icing in engine pressure lines, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency states. This is despite a previous update to the Leap-1B software which was introduced after a similar problem affected the Leap-1A engine for the Airbus A320neo family. Instances of Leap-1As being unable to accelerate to target thrust during take-off had prompted analysis which determined that water could accumulate and freeze inside the pressure sensor lines or system, possibly resulting in erroneous pressure readings by the full-authority digital engine control. CFM developed new electronic engine control software to handle erroneous readings more effectively, and this was applied not just to the Leap-1A but also the similar -1B. But EASA says icing-related loss of thrust control has occurred on Leap-1Bs which had already been updated with the revised software. CFM has since revised the software to “improve detection and accommodation” of erroneous pressure readings, and EASA is to require 737 Max operators to modify the operating software configuration. The change is among a series of updates to the airworthiness limitations section of the Leap-1B engine shop manual. This revision enhances inspection of stage-two high-pressure turbine rotor discs, as a precaution against uncontained failure, after discovery of a sub-surface anomaly in a part manufactured from the same disc alloy. It also adapts instructions for high-pressure turbine static structure inspections after incidents relating to fuel-nozzle coking and “thermal distress”, says EASA, and updates inspection and in-service limits to address radial drive shaft bearing cage failures.",1,794,6.0,0.5802,"engine, maintenance, fuel, takeoff, result, failure, system, problem, power, issue","['operator', 'instruct', 'update', 'enginecontrol', 'software', 'address', 'loss', 'thrust', 'issue', 'attribute', 'ice', 'type', 'cfm', 'international', 'powerplants', 'least', 'occurrence', 'investigate', 'suffer', 'temporary', 'loss', 'thrust', 'control', 'result', 'ice', 'engine', 'pressure', 'line', 'european', 'union', 'safety', 'agency', 'state', 'despite', 'previous', 'update', 'software', 'introduce', 'similar', 'problem', 'affected', 'engine', 'family', 'instance', 'unable', 'accelerate', 'target', 'thrust', 'takeoff', 'prompt', 'analysis', 'determine', 'water', 'accumulate', 'freeze', 'inside', 'pressure', 'sensor', 'line', 'system', 'possibly', 'result', 'erroneous', 'pressure', 'reading', 'fullauthority', 'digital', 'engine', 'control', 'cfm', 'developed', 'electronic', 'engine', 'control', 'software', 'handle', 'erroneous', 'reading', 'effectively', 'apply', 'similar', 'easa', 'say', 'icingrelated', 'loss', 'thrust', 'control', 'occur', 'already', 'update', 'revise', 'software', 'cfm', 'since', 'revise', 'software', 'improve', 'detection', 'accommodation', 'erroneous', 'pressure', 'reading', 'easa', 'require', 'operator', 'modify', 'operating', 'software', 'configuration', 'change', 'among', 'series', 'update', 'airworthiness', 'limitation', 'section', 'engine', 'shop', 'manual', 'revision', 'enhances', 'inspection', 'stagetwo', 'highpressure', 'turbine', 'rotor', 'disc', 'precaution', 'uncontained', 'failure', 'discovery', 'subsurface', 'anomaly', 'part', 'manufacture', 'disc', 'alloy', 'adapts', 'instruction', 'highpressure', 'turbine', 'static', 'structure', 'inspection', 'incident', 'relate', 'fuelnozzle', 'coke', 'thermal', 'distress', 'say', 'easa', 'update', 'inspection', 'inservice', 'limit', 'address', 'radial', 'drive', 'shaft', 'bearing', 'cage', 'failure']"
"A Lockheed Martin EC-130Q firefighting aircraft has crashed in the Australian state of New South Wales while combating forest fires, killing three crew members. The commissioner of the New South Wales Rural Fire Service, Shane Fitzsimmons, has confirmed the crash. The accident occurred near the Peak View area, which lies 130km to the south of Canberra in mountainous terrain. Australian television reports that the crash site has been located by helicopters. Coulson Aviation (USA) confirms that the aircraft involved bears the registration N134CG (MSN4904) and that it disappeared at roughly 13:00 local time. The aircraft was operated by Coulson Aircrane (USA). Reports indicate that the company has suspended all tanker operations in Australia following the crash. “The Aircraft had departed Richmond, NSW with a load of retardant and was on a firebombing mission,” says Coulson in a statement. It will send a team to the site to assist emergency operations. All three crew were American citizens. The aircraft was delivered new to the US Navy in 1981. It later served with NASA for experimental work from 1992 to 1993, at which point it was placed in storage. Coulson acquired it in 2017 and converted the aircraft to perform aerial firefighting work. According to Coulson Aviation's web site, its firefighting C-130s are equipped with a RADS-XXL roll-on, roll-off tanking system that can carry 4,000USgal of fluid.

"Air Canada has extended the absence of the 737 Max from its schedules through 30 June as the grounding of the aircraft drags on and the US Federal Aviation Administration continues its review of whether they are safe to resume service. The Montreal-based carrier's 22 January announcement comes a day after Boeing stated: “We are currently estimating that the un-grounding of the 737 Max will begin during mid-2020.” That prediction was based on the progress of the certification process. Cirium fleets data shows that Air Canada has 24 Max 8 in storage and another 26 on order, along with 11 Max 9s. Boeing had prior to December estimated that regulators would clear Max jet to fly by the end of 2019. That was before FAA administrator Steve Dickson said too much work remained on the certification process. The FAA has shied from providing a timeline, but industry observers had speculated that certification would come early in 2020, perhaps before April. Air Canada's decision reflects growing uncertainty among airlines. On 21 January, shortly after the Boeing announcement, Canada's second-largest carrier WestJet took the Max out of its schedule until 24 June. WestJet has 13 Max jets in storage and 44 on order, according to Cirium fleets data. Airlines have worked hard to adapt during the grounding while cancelling a minimum of flights, but it is uncertain how long they can continue emergency measures that include extra hours for their maintenance staff to maximise the service availability of other aircraft. Extending the Max's absence for a second summer travel season would also deepen the potential hit to profits from diminished capacity. Air Canada extended aircraft leases to offset the impact of its grounded Max aircraft, which account for 24% of its narrowbody fleet. The Star Alliance carrier's third-quarter profit declined 9% to C$636 million ($487 million).",1,797,11.0,0.1686,"pilot, faa, issue, safety, include, report, require, training, ground, order","['canada', 'extend', 'absence', 'schedule', 'june', 'ground', 'drag', 'u', 'federal', 'administration', 'continue', 'review', 'whether', 'safe', 'resume', 'service', 'montrealbased', 'carrier', 'january', 'announcement', 'come', 'day', 'state', 'currently', 'estimate', 'ungrounding', 'begin', 'prediction', 'base', 'progress', 'certification', 'process', 'fleet', 'data', 'canada', 'storage', 'another', 'order', 'along', 'prior', 'december', 'estimate', 'regulator', 'clear', 'jet', 'fly', 'end', 'faa', 'administrator', 'steve', 'dickson', 'say', 'much', 'work', 'remain', 'certification', 'process', 'faa', 'shy', 'provide', 'timeline', 'industry', 'observer', 'speculate', 'certification', 'come', 'early', 'perhaps', 'april', 'canada', 'decision', 'reflect', 'grow', 'uncertainty', 'among', 'january', 'shortly', 'announcement', 'canada', 'secondlargest', 'carrier', 'westjet', 'take', 'schedule', 'june', 'westjet', 'jet', 'storage', 'order', 'accord', 'fleet', 'data', 'work', 'hard', 'adapt', 'ground', 'cancel', 'minimum', 'uncertain', 'long', 'continue', 'emergency', 'measure', 'include', 'extra', 'hour', 'maintenance', 'staff', 'maximise', 'service', 'availability', 'extend', 'absence', 'second', 'summer', 'travel', 'season', 'deepen', 'potential', 'hit', 'profit', 'diminish', 'capacity', 'canada', 'extend', 'lease', 'offset', 'impact', 'ground', 'account', 'narrowbody', 'fleet', 'star', 'alliance', 'carrier', 'thirdquarter', 'profit', 'decline', 'c']"
"United Airlines is not planning for the Boeing 737 Max's return to service this summer, making it the first airline to announce it will operate without the aircraft during a second peak travel season. The troubled aircraft has been grounded since March 2019 after two deadly crashes that killed 346 people. The Federal Aviation Administration has not given a timeline for the aircraft's re-certification, and Boeing said earlier this week it expects it will be “mid-2020” before the Max can realistically return to service. “We continue to assume there will be a safe return of the Max and we're actually encouraged at what we hope is a more realistic timeline or target,” the Chicago-based carrier's president Scott Kirby says on 22 January. “We will announce our own pushback of service to give us time to get the airplane up and running and time for classroom training and simulator training for our pilots.” Chief commercial officer Andrew Nocella added, “We are now assessing the impact to the schedule, but don't anticipate flying the Max this summer.” Boeing said on Tuesday that it now expects the Federal Aviation Administration will re-certificate the 737 Max in the middle of 2020. The company's latest projection “accounts for the rigorous scrutiny that regulatory authorities are rightly applying at every step of their review of the 737 Max's flight control system, and the Joint Operations Evaluation Board process, which determines pilot training requirements,” the Chicago-based company said. Previously, United had removed the aircraft from its schedules through 4 June. Other airlines had followed suit, with many modifying their schedules well into that month, and peak summer holiday travel season. The new delays could mean the entire industry will spend a second summer without the new, fuel-efficient aircraft. United's executives also say it is too early to plan for Max aircraft that are already built and waiting for delivery, and were reluctant to give guidance on how much they will allocate to their capital expenditure budgets in the coming years. “There are 16 aircraft already built, sitting in Boeing facilities, and we'd like to get those,” chief financial officer Gerry Laderman says. “Especially after Boeing shut down the line they need to tell the customers how they will allocate slots to everyone and that will drive our 2021 Capex numbers.” The Max grounding and delivery delays have also affected the airline's strategy in expanding connectivity in its North American mid-continent hubs, Nocella says. United has 14 Max aircraft in storage and another 166 Max on order, according to Cirium fleets data. As for pilot and crew training related to the aircraft, United anticipates little problem fulfilling any additional training requirements the FAA will demand once the 737 Max is again green-lighted for service. “We don't anticipate any issues if simulator training is required by the FAA,” says Greg Hart, chief operations officer. “We have ample simulator capacity and are working on plans that will allow us to comply with the guidance the FAA issues.” He adds that the company has one fixed training device in Denver, and expects another to be up and running in the next six to eight weeks and two more later in the year. HIGHER PROFIT United posted higher profits and revenues for the full year 2019 on Tuesday, as traveler demand climbed and fuel prices were lower than expected. Full year net profit rose 41.8% to $3 billion, from $2.1 billion in 2018, and overall revenue rose 4.7% to $43.3 billion, from $41.3 billion in 2018. The airline also says it flew more passengers in 2019 than in any year in its history. During 2019, the airline announced new international routes, including direct flights from Newark to Cape Town, Prague and Naples, several expanded routes, including four new daily nonstop flights to Tokyo's Haneda airport. In the last quarter of the year the airline took delivery of delivery of two new 777-300ER, two new 787-10, nine new Embraer E175 as well as several used aircraft. It also had announced an order to purchase 50 new Airbus A321XLR aircraft. ASIA UNCERTAINTY While Latin America has continued to be a strong region for the airline, Asia lagged behind in 2019, executives say. Earlier this month the airline said it was taking a $90 impairment on its routes to Hong Kong due to lower demand. But demand to Beijing and Shanghai had picked up in the last few weeks, Nocella says, before reports that a new coronavirus had broken out in the region. Executives say they are monitoring the reports about the virus, which has killed 17 people in China, sickened hundreds and is beginning to spread around the world. “We can't tell you what the impact of the coronavirus will be. We are coordinating closely with the Centers for Disease Control, and taking necessary steps to ensure that customers can travel safely,” Kirby says. “We will follow the experts' advice closely.”",1,798,11.0,0.2135,"pilot, faa, issue, safety, include, report, require, training, ground, order","['united', 'planning', 'return', 'service', 'summer', 'make', 'announce', 'operate', 'without', 'second', 'peak', 'travel', 'season', 'troubled', 'ground', 'since', 'march', 'deadly', 'crash', 'kill', 'people', 'federal', 'administration', 'give', 'timeline', 'recertification', 'say', 'earlier', 'week', 'expect', 'realistically', 'return', 'service', 'continue', 'assume', 'safe', 'return', 'actually', 'encourage', 'hope', 'realistic', 'timeline', 'target', 'chicagobased', 'carrier', 'president', 'scott', 'kirby', 'say', 'january', 'announce', 'pushback', 'service', 'give', 'u', 'get', 'airplane', 'run', 'classroom', 'training', 'simulator', 'training', 'chief', 'commercial', 'officer', 'andrew', 'nocella', 'add', 'assess', 'impact', 'schedule', 'anticipate', 'fly', 'say', 'tuesday', 'expect', 'federal', 'administration', 'recertificate', 'middle', 'late', 'projection', 'account', 'rigorous', 'scrutiny', 'regulatory', 'authority', 'rightly', 'apply', 'every', 'step', 'review', 'control', 'system', 'joint', 'operation', 'evaluation', 'board', 'process', 'determines', 'pilot', 'training', 'requirement', 'chicagobased', 'say', 'previously', 'united', 'remove', 'schedule', 'june', 'follow', 'suit', 'many', 'modify', 'schedule', 'well', 'month', 'peak', 'summer', 'holiday', 'travel', 'season', 'delay', 'mean', 'entire', 'industry', 'spend', 'second', 'summer', 'without', 'fuelefficient', 'united', 'executive', 'say', 'early', 'plan', 'already', 'built', 'wait', 'delivery', 'reluctant', 'give', 'guidance', 'much', 'allocate', 'capital', 'expenditure', 'budget', 'come', 'already', 'built', 'sit', 'facility', 'like', 'get', 'chief', 'financial', 'officer', 'gerry', 'laderman', 'say', 'especially', 'shut', 'line', 'need', 'tell', 'customer', 'allocate', 'slot', 'everyone', 'drive', 'capex', 'ground', 'delivery', 'delay', 'affected', 'strategy', 'expand', 'connectivity', 'north', 'american', 'midcontinent', 'hub', 'nocella', 'say', 'united', 'storage', 'another', 'order', 'accord', 'fleet', 'data', 'pilot', 'crew', 'training', 'related', 'united', 'anticipates', 'little', 'problem', 'fulfil', 'additional', 'training', 'requirement', 'faa', 'demand', 'greenlighted', 'service', 'anticipate', 'issue', 'simulator', 'training', 'require', 'faa', 'say', 'greg', 'hart', 'chief', 'operation', 'officer', 'ample', 'simulator', 'capacity', 'work', 'plan', 'allow', 'u', 'comply', 'guidance', 'faa', 'add', 'fix', 'training', 'device', 'denver', 'expect', 'another', 'run', 'next', 'week', 'later', 'high', 'profit', 'united', 'post', 'high', 'profit', 'revenue', 'full', 'tuesday', 'traveler', 'demand', 'climbed', 'fuel', 'price', 'low', 'expect', 'full', 'net', 'profit', 'rise', 'overall', 'revenue', 'rise', 'say', 'flew', 'passenger', 'history', 'announce', 'international', 'route', 'include', 'direct', 'newark', 'cape', 'town', 'prague', 'naples', 'several', 'expand', 'route', 'include', 'daily', 'nonstop', 'tokyo', 'haneda', 'airport', 'quarter', 'take', 'delivery', 'delivery', 'embraer', 'well', 'several', 'use', 'announce', 'order', 'purchase', 'asia', 'uncertainty', 'latin', 'america', 'continued', 'strong', 'region', 'asia', 'lag', 'behind', 'executive', 'say', 'earlier', 'month', 'say', 'take', 'impairment', 'route', 'hong', 'kong', 'due', 'low', 'demand', 'demand', 'beijing', 'shanghai', 'picked', 'week', 'nocella', 'say', 'report', 'coronavirus', 'broken', 'region', 'executive', 'say', 'monitoring', 'report', 'virus', 'kill', 'people', 'sicken', 'hundred', 'begin', 'spread', 'around', 'world', 'ca', 'tell', 'impact', 'coronavirus', 'coordinate', 'closely', 'center', 'disease', 'control', 'take', 'necessary', 'step', 'ensure', 'customer', 'travel', 'safely', 'kirby', 'say', 'follow', 'expert', 'advice', 'closely']"
"The Flight Safety Foundation thinks that creating new, regionally based aircraft crash investigation teams could help bring impartiality and expertise to crash probes that might otherwise be hamstrung by politics, bias and technical inexperience. Recent commercial aircraft crashes and resulting investigations have led the nonprofit to consider recommending such investigation teams be formed, at least in some regions of the globe, says Flight Safety Foundation chief executive Hassan Shahidi. “A regional model would be good first step...We are looking into it,” Shahidi tells FlightGlobal on 21 January. “What we really need is an independent, well-staffed and trained cross-border international accident investigation authority,” adds Flight Safety Foundation general counsel Kenneth Quinn. Should the group approve the idea, it could recommend it to ICAO, which sets guidelines for aviation crash investigations. Those guidelines call for accidents to be investigated by the state in which they occur, though states may pass investigations to other states. Representatives of countries from which affected airlines and manufacturers hail are also entitled to participate. Many countries have accident investigation bureaus, but only several have the technical expertise and independence from political pressure needed to complete unbiased reviews, Quinn says. “The problem we really have, which is actually acute, is that we have accident investigation authorities that are too slow, that are too biased and are too inexperienced, and they don't have enough resources,” he says. Forming independent investigation boards could help ensure international conflicts and diplomatic pressures do not influence investigations. Such groups could be counted on to complete their work “in a timely way that doesn't trash the reputation of manufacturers or an airline, and that can be treated with trust”, says Quinn. Accident investigations involving international parties have long proved contentious, but recent crashes have spurred more discussion about a solution. For instance, experts have concern whether Iranian authorities will permit an unbiased review into the loss of Ukraine International Airlines flight PS752 on 8 January. Iran already said its military accidently downed the Boeing 737-800 with a missile. Likewise, some safety experts have faulted Indonesia's investigation team for placing outsize blame on Boeing for the October 2018 crash of a Lion Air 737 Max. They have raised similar concern about the still-ongoing investigation into the crash of an Ethiopian Airlines 737 Max in March last year.",1,799,10.0,0.3796,"international, authority, civil, state, investigation, case, add, january, airasia, crash","['safety', 'foundation', 'think', 'create', 'regionally', 'base', 'crash', 'investigation', 'team', 'help', 'bring', 'impartiality', 'expertise', 'crash', 'probe', 'might', 'otherwise', 'hamstrung', 'politics', 'bias', 'technical', 'inexperience', 'recent', 'commercial', 'crash', 'result', 'investigation', 'lead', 'nonprofit', 'consider', 'recommend', 'investigation', 'team', 'form', 'least', 'region', 'globe', 'say', 'safety', 'foundation', 'chief', 'executive', 'hassan', 'shahidi', 'regional', 'model', 'good', 'step', 'look', 'shahidi', 'tell', 'flightglobal', 'january', 'really', 'need', 'independent', 'wellstaffed', 'train', 'crossborder', 'international', 'accident', 'investigation', 'authority', 'add', 'safety', 'foundation', 'general', 'counsel', 'kenneth', 'quinn', 'approve', 'idea', 'recommend', 'icao', 'set', 'guideline', 'crash', 'investigation', 'guideline', 'call', 'accident', 'investigate', 'state', 'occur', 'though', 'state', 'may', 'pas', 'investigation', 'state', 'representative', 'country', 'affected', 'manufacturer', 'hail', 'entitle', 'participate', 'many', 'country', 'accident', 'investigation', 'bureau', 'several', 'technical', 'expertise', 'independence', 'political', 'pressure', 'need', 'complete', 'unbiased', 'review', 'quinn', 'say', 'problem', 'really', 'actually', 'acute', 'accident', 'investigation', 'authority', 'slow', 'bias', 'inexperienced', 'enough', 'resource', 'say', 'form', 'independent', 'investigation', 'board', 'help', 'ensure', 'international', 'conflict', 'diplomatic', 'pressure', 'influence', 'investigation', 'count', 'complete', 'work', 'timely', 'way', 'trash', 'reputation', 'manufacturer', 'treat', 'trust', 'say', 'quinn', 'accident', 'investigation', 'involve', 'international', 'party', 'long', 'prove', 'contentious', 'recent', 'crash', 'spur', 'discussion', 'solution', 'instance', 'expert', 'concern', 'whether', 'iranian', 'authority', 'permit', 'unbiased', 'review', 'loss', 'ukraine', 'international', 'january', 'iran', 'already', 'say', 'military', 'accidently', 'missile', 'likewise', 'safety', 'expert', 'fault', 'indonesia', 'investigation', 'team', 'place', 'outsize', 'blame', 'october', 'crash', 'lion', 'raise', 'similar', 'concern', 'stillongoing', 'investigation', 'crash', 'ethiopian', 'march']"
"French investigators have disclosed that an Air France Airbus A319 was forced to make a single-engine landing at Paris Charles de Gaulle after an undetected indicator fault resulted in partial fuel exhaustion. Investigation authority BEA – which analysed the 12 March 2014 event – says pilots operating a series of Marseille-Nantes services performed a routine discrepancy check on the theoretical and actual fuel usage, and found the difference to be just 20kg. But BEA says the aircraft had been experiencing intermittent failure of its fuel quantity indicator, and the actual difference was 880kg. Analysis of refuelling documents and technical log entries for the aircraft (F-GRHT) revealed several calculation errors by crews – sometimes as much as 1t – which, says BEA, suggests verifications of the calculations by the first officer was “not systematically carried out”. This could explain, it says, why the indicator failure was not previously identified and resolved. When a subsequent crew prepared the A319 for a Marseille-Paris flight, the jet indicated 3,780kg of fuel on board, and the pilots opted to uplift 1,200kg of fuel to bring the total to about 5,000kg. BEA found, however, that the actual fuel on board when the engines were started was about 3,800kg and that the fuel indicator was overestimating the quantity by 1,270kg. Just 15min after take-off an automated alert warned of a low fuel level in the left wing tank. After a check, the crew believed this was a nuisance alarm linked to a known probe failure in the outer left tank. But during the descent to 8,000ft, nearly 1h into the flight, the crew was alerted to a pressure drop in two fuel pumps on the left-hand CFM International CFM56 engine. This deteriorated, a few minutes later, into an engine failure. The crew declared an emergency and landed with only the right-hand powerplant running. Maintenance personnel found that the left tank was empty and only 1,100kg of fuel – equating to 150kg above final reserve – remained in the right tank. Inspection showed that the left and right engines had respectively burned 1,272kg and 1,525kg of fuel, confirming that the fuel-quantity indication of 5,080kg after the uplift at Marseille was a substantial overestimation.",1,800,6.0,0.4349,"engine, maintenance, fuel, takeoff, result, failure, system, problem, power, issue","['french', 'investigator', 'disclose', 'france', 'force', 'make', 'singleengine', 'land', 'paris', 'charles', 'de', 'gaulle', 'undetected', 'indicator', 'fault', 'result', 'partial', 'fuel', 'exhaustion', 'investigation', 'authority', 'bea', 'analyse', 'march', 'event', 'say', 'pilot', 'operating', 'series', 'marseillenantes', 'service', 'perform', 'routine', 'discrepancy', 'check', 'theoretical', 'actual', 'fuel', 'usage', 'found', 'difference', 'bea', 'say', 'experience', 'intermittent', 'failure', 'fuel', 'quantity', 'indicator', 'actual', 'difference', 'analysis', 'refuel', 'document', 'technical', 'log', 'entry', 'fgrht', 'reveal', 'several', 'calculation', 'error', 'crew', 'sometimes', 'much', 'say', 'bea', 'suggests', 'verification', 'calculation', 'officer', 'systematically', 'carry', 'explain', 'say', 'indicator', 'failure', 'previously', 'identify', 'resolve', 'subsequent', 'crew', 'prepared', 'marseilleparis', 'jet', 'indicate', 'fuel', 'board', 'pilot', 'opt', 'uplift', 'fuel', 'bring', 'total', 'bea', 'found', 'however', 'actual', 'fuel', 'board', 'engine', 'start', 'fuel', 'indicator', 'overestimate', 'quantity', 'takeoff', 'automate', 'alert', 'warn', 'low', 'fuel', 'level', 'left', 'wing', 'tank', 'check', 'crew', 'believe', 'nuisance', 'alarm', 'link', 'know', 'probe', 'failure', 'outer', 'left', 'tank', 'descent', 'nearly', 'crew', 'alert', 'pressure', 'drop', 'fuel', 'pump', 'lefthand', 'cfm', 'international', 'engine', 'deteriorate', 'minute', 'later', 'engine', 'failure', 'crew', 'declare', 'emergency', 'land', 'righthand', 'powerplant', 'run', 'maintenance', 'personnel', 'found', 'left', 'tank', 'empty', 'fuel', 'equate', 'final', 'reserve', 'remain', 'right', 'tank', 'inspection', 'left', 'right', 'engine', 'respectively', 'burn', 'fuel', 'confirm', 'fuelquantity', 'indication', 'uplift', 'marseille', 'substantial', 'overestimation']"
"The cargo freight market is likely to remain weak this year, industry leaders believe, as it remains hampered by overcapacity and weak growth in several regions around the world. “We see 2020 not improving significantly...There will be some capacity coming out of the market, so there is some balance coming, but the price pressure will continue,” Cargolux finance chief Maxim Straus said at the Airline Economics Growth Frontiers conference in Dublin. “There are lots of areas of the world that are shaky,” he adds, noting weakness in South America and Hong Kong. The Luxembourg-based airline will still announce a profit for 2019 and intends to keep its capacity roughly steady through 2020. It expects freight growth to return in 2021. Ed McGarvey, treasurer of Atlas Air Worldwide, notes that “2019 was a challenge”, citing “Trump, trade and tariffs”. The airline has previously announced that its 2019 earnings would be 60-65% of the level in 2018. “Our expectations for 2020 is the market is soft...The first half of the year will continue to be soft. The back half of the year should pick up,” says McGarvey. While the general freight market faces difficulties, the “Amazon effect” of growth in e-commerce presents an opportunity of which Atlas is looking to take advantage. Still, a sign of the market's overall weakness is that Atlas is examining whether to temporarily park part of its fleet. Robert Convey, vice-president of sales and marketing at Aeronautical Engineers, which converts passenger aircraft to freighters, say the Boeing 737 Max's grounding has been a huge negative for its business. “The Max just killed it,” he says. “The restriction of feedstock has been massive.” Older aircraft that would have been candidates for freighter conversion are being kept in passenger service. China is one important region where conversions have ceased, while in Southeast Asia they have hit a “brick wall”, laments Convey. In Europe and North America, meanwhile, older Boeing 737 models than previously are being converted. Convey also points out that the US Federal Aviation Administration has hardened its stance because of the Max crisis, and is taking much longer to approve companies to perform conversions: “It's fundamentally changed the way the FAA are looking at new freighter conversions...The effect that [the Boeing Max crisis has] had on the FAA is dramatic. It's a different world.” The process has thus become longer and more expensive. The hiatus on new feedstock could last two years, Convey reckons, given the challenges of reintroducing the Max and the fact that many passenger aircraft have had their leases extended by two or three years. McGarvey says the concerns over recent years that the belly space in the Boeing 787 and Airbus A350 might take business away from dedicated freighters have not, however, come to pass. “Passenger aircraft do not fly at the right times,” he says, arguing that dedicated freighters are able to supply the flexibility that cargo customers require. “They move at different times, they move in different patterns.” Brexit is unlikely to have a substantial short-term impact on the market, in the view of participants. Straus comments that the UK accounts for around 6% of Cargolux's volumes. He believes there will be no impact during the transitional period that runs from January 31 to the end of 2021 – or even a pick-up in the charter trade. Thereafter, however, an EU-UK air services deal is required, which “could be an impact on the tonnage”. There is also the potential for customs changes to affect operations over the long-term, he notes.",1,801,9.0,0.4292,"industry, crisis, demand, coronavirus, global, iata, market, level, cargo, expect","['cargo', 'freight', 'market', 'likely', 'remain', 'weak', 'industry', 'leader', 'believe', 'remains', 'hamper', 'overcapacity', 'weak', 'growth', 'several', 'region', 'around', 'world', 'see', 'improve', 'significantly', 'capacity', 'come', 'market', 'balance', 'come', 'price', 'pressure', 'continue', 'cargolux', 'finance', 'chief', 'maxim', 'straus', 'say', 'economics', 'growth', 'frontier', 'conference', 'dublin', 'lot', 'area', 'world', 'shaky', 'add', 'note', 'weakness', 'south', 'america', 'hong', 'kong', 'luxembourgbased', 'still', 'announce', 'profit', 'intend', 'keep', 'capacity', 'roughly', 'steady', 'expect', 'freight', 'growth', 'return', 'ed', 'mcgarvey', 'treasurer', 'atlas', 'worldwide', 'note', 'challenge', 'cite', 'trump', 'trade', 'tariff', 'previously', 'announce', 'earnings', 'level', 'expectation', 'market', 'soft', 'half', 'continue', 'soft', 'back', 'half', 'pick', 'say', 'mcgarvey', 'general', 'freight', 'market', 'face', 'difficulty', 'amazon', 'effect', 'growth', 'ecommerce', 'present', 'opportunity', 'atlas', 'look', 'take', 'advantage', 'still', 'sign', 'market', 'overall', 'weakness', 'atlas', 'examine', 'whether', 'temporarily', 'park', 'part', 'fleet', 'robert', 'convey', 'vicepresident', 'sale', 'marketing', 'aeronautical', 'engineer', 'convert', 'passenger', 'freighter', 'say', 'ground', 'huge', 'negative', 'business', 'kill', 'say', 'restriction', 'feedstock', 'old', 'candidate', 'freighter', 'conversion', 'kept', 'passenger', 'service', 'important', 'region', 'conversion', 'cease', 'southeast', 'asia', 'hit', 'brick', 'wall', 'lament', 'convey', 'europe', 'north', 'america', 'meanwhile', 'old', 'model', 'previously', 'convert', 'convey', 'point', 'u', 'federal', 'administration', 'harden', 'stance', 'crisis', 'take', 'much', 'longer', 'approve', 'perform', 'conversion', 'fundamentally', 'change', 'way', 'faa', 'look', 'freighter', 'conversion', 'effect', 'crisis', 'faa', 'dramatic', 'different', 'process', 'thus', 'become', 'longer', 'expensive', 'hiatus', 'feedstock', 'convey', 'reckons', 'give', 'challenge', 'reintroduce', 'fact', 'many', 'passenger', 'lease', 'extend', 'mcgarvey', 'say', 'concern', 'recent', 'belly', 'space', 'might', 'take', 'business', 'away', 'dedicate', 'freighter', 'however', 'come', 'pas', 'passenger', 'fly', 'right', 'say', 'argue', 'dedicate', 'freighter', 'able', 'supply', 'flexibility', 'cargo', 'customer', 'require', 'move', 'different', 'move', 'different', 'brexit', 'unlikely', 'substantial', 'shortterm', 'impact', 'market', 'view', 'participant', 'straus', 'comment', 'uk', 'account', 'around', 'cargolux', 'volume', 'believe', 'impact', 'transitional', 'period', 'run', 'january', 'end', 'even', 'pickup', 'charter', 'trade', 'thereafter', 'however', 'euuk', 'service', 'deal', 'require', 'impact', 'tonnage', 'potential', 'custom', 'change', 'affect', 'operation', 'longterm', 'note']"
"British Airways is expecting to put a four-week old Airbus A350-1000 back into service on 23 January, after precautionary checks following a hard landing at Tel Aviv. The aircraft (G-XWBD) had registered the abnormal landing as the aircraft touched down on runway 12 at about 05:30 on 20 January, following the BA163 service from London Heathrow. Israeli ministry of transport chief investigator Gad Regev says the authority has obtained “all the clarifications and information which we required” from the UK airline, but declines to disclose further details. FlightGlobal understands, however, that the aircraft underwent checks after the crew was alerted to the hard landing, and that the subsequent return flight was cancelled. None of the occupants was injured. The aircraft – which was delivered to the carrier less than a month before, on 23 December – was ferried back to Heathrow on 21 January, and is due to resume service on 23 January. While hard landings are not uncommon events, BA is likely to be exercising particular caution because the A350 is a new aircraft type, and is taking advantage of its Heathrow maintenance base to carry out detailed checks it would have been unable to perform in Israel. The airline states: “After our aircraft experienced a hard landing into Tel Aviv, our highly-skilled engineers checked over the aircraft and it has since been flown back to Heathrow.” Meteorological data from Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion airport indicates rain and 11kt winds from the south around the time of the approach, subsequently becoming variable, but other circumstances which led to the hard landing have yet to become clear. Original delivery of the aircraft to BA was held up after G-XWBD was damaged in an incident during completion of the aircraft at the Airbus production facility in Toulouse.",1,802,7.0,0.2709,"crew, runway, inquiry, land, approach, accident, investigator, captain, incident, pilot","['british', 'airway', 'expect', 'put', 'fourweek', 'old', 'back', 'service', 'january', 'precautionary', 'check', 'follow', 'hard', 'land', 'tel', 'aviv', 'gxwbd', 'register', 'abnormal', 'land', 'touch', 'runway', 'january', 'follow', 'service', 'london', 'heathrow', 'israeli', 'ministry', 'transport', 'chief', 'investigator', 'gad', 'regev', 'say', 'authority', 'obtain', 'clarification', 'information', 'require', 'uk', 'decline', 'disclose', 'far', 'detail', 'flightglobal', 'understands', 'however', 'underwent', 'check', 'crew', 'alert', 'hard', 'land', 'subsequent', 'return', 'cancel', 'none', 'occupant', 'injured', 'deliver', 'carrier', 'less', 'month', 'december', 'ferry', 'back', 'heathrow', 'january', 'due', 'resume', 'service', 'january', 'hard', 'landing', 'uncommon', 'event', 'ba', 'likely', 'exercise', 'particular', 'caution', 'type', 'take', 'advantage', 'heathrow', 'maintenance', 'base', 'carry', 'detailed', 'check', 'unable', 'perform', 'israel', 'state', 'experienced', 'hard', 'land', 'tel', 'aviv', 'highlyskilled', 'engineer', 'checked', 'since', 'flown', 'back', 'meteorological', 'data', 'tel', 'aviv', 'ben', 'gurion', 'airport', 'indicates', 'rain', 'wind', 'south', 'around', 'approach', 'subsequently', 'become', 'variable', 'circumstance', 'lead', 'hard', 'land', 'yet', 'become', 'clear', 'original', 'delivery', 'ba', 'held', 'gxwbd', 'damage', 'incident', 'completion', 'production', 'facility', 'toulouse']"
"Grounded Kazakh operator Bek Air is continuing to defend its operations and practices after being slated by the country's regulator in the aftermath of the fatal Fokker 100 accident at Almaty. Bek Air is accusing Kazakhstan's aviation administration of proving “strained and biased” remarks about the airline's procedures and safety management following an inspection of the carrier. The administration had particularly highlighted missing data plates on engines which, it said, prevented identification of individual powerplants or their usage. Bek Air attributes the loss of some data plates to “vibrations and other loads on the aircraft”, claiming that it chose to remove plates which were “weakly attached” to expensive components – including engines – and store them at engineering facilities for record-keeping. “Labels were fitted to the units if they were sent for replacement or repair,” it adds. “There has not been a single case of confusion.” While Bek Air claims this practice is not specifically prohibited, it says it will make duplicates to fit on engines and parts to help improve tracking. It insists it has no problems with affording spares for its small Fokker 100 fleet and is within its rights to swap components between aircraft if necessary, claiming that it has sometimes been forced take such measures when incoming replacement spares are held up “for weeks” by customs policies. The airline claims it spent nearly $12 million on sourcing spares from 47 suppliers last year, demonstrating that it has adequate finances to support the fleet. Bek Air has also countered the regulator's accusations over training and procedures for winter operations. It argues that its pre-flight procedures include ensuring that control surfaces are clean, including with tactile methods, and that surveillance video indicating that crews omitted such checks “cannot be reliable” if evidence is taken from cameras sited at distances of more than 200m. Icing remains a prime suspect in the Fokker 100 accident at Almaty which occurred on 27 December, and which led to the carrier's immediate grounding. Bek Air points out that its cockpit crew members undergo training at the same centre, in Amsterdam, as Air Astana pilots and that, twice per year, the airline also provides supplementary training which covers pre-departure checks during icing conditions.

AirAsia and AirAsia X were each fined MYR2 million ($491,000) for charging payment processing fees separately from base fares, which contravenes local laws on consumer protection. This is their second violation, which attracted a tenfold increase on the MYR200,000 they were each fined in September 2019. Separately, MAHB's subsidiary MA Sepang was fined MYR856,900 for failing to meet service standards at Kuala Lumpur International airport between April and June 2019. MAVCOM did not specify whether this was for the main KLIA terminal or the KLIA2 terminal that primarily services low-cost carriers. Since the start of 2018, the AirAsia carriers have been involved in a dispute with MAHB over equalising passenger charges for southeast Asian passengers departing from the main and KLIA2 terminals. AirAsia Group's chief executive Tony Fernandes has argued that KLIA2 is a low-cost facility and should have lower passenger charges than the main KLIA terminal. This was repeatedly rejected by MAVCOM. In December 2018, MAHB filed a lawsuit against the two airlines after they failed to remit the higher charges owed to the airport operator. This was followed by a MYR480 million counterclaim by AirAsia and AirAsiaX against MA Sepang in January 2019, relating to losses and damages. This, they said, were caused by MA Sepang's “negligence in the management, operation, maintenance, and provision of airport services and facilities at KLIA2” terminal building.",1,804,10.0,0.2571,"international, authority, civil, state, investigation, case, add, january, airasia, crash","['malaysian', 'commission', 'mavcom', 'impose', 'fine', 'local', 'airasia', 'carrier', 'malaysia', 'airport', 'mahb', 'subsidiary', 'various', 'infringement', 'airasia', 'airasia', 'x', 'fin', 'charge', 'payment', 'processing', 'fee', 'separately', 'base', 'fare', 'contravenes', 'local', 'law', 'consumer', 'protection', 'second', 'violation', 'attract', 'tenfold', 'increase', 'fin', 'september', 'separately', 'mahb', 'subsidiary', 'sepang', 'fin', 'fail', 'meet', 'service', 'standard', 'kuala', 'lumpur', 'international', 'airport', 'april', 'june', 'mavcom', 'specify', 'whether', 'main', 'klia', 'terminal', 'terminal', 'primarily', 'service', 'lowcost', 'carrier', 'since', 'start', 'airasia', 'carrier', 'involve', 'dispute', 'mahb', 'equalise', 'passenger', 'charge', 'southeast', 'asian', 'passenger', 'depart', 'main', 'terminal', 'airasia', 'chief', 'executive', 'tony', 'fernandes', 'argue', 'lowcost', 'facility', 'low', 'passenger', 'charge', 'main', 'klia', 'terminal', 'repeatedly', 'reject', 'mavcom', 'december', 'mahb', 'file', 'lawsuit', 'fail', 'remit', 'high', 'charge', 'owe', 'airport', 'operator', 'follow', 'counterclaim', 'airasia', 'airasiax', 'sepang', 'january', 'relate', 'loss', 'damage', 'say', 'cause', 'sepang', 'negligence', 'management', 'operation', 'maintenance', 'provision', 'airport', 'service', 'facility', 'terminal', 'building']"
"Responding to rumours that it plans to acquire a stake in Malaysia Airlines, Air France-KLM states that it “is not a current party to the sales process” of the Kuala Lumpur-based carrier “at this stage”. However, the Franco-Dutch airline group confirms in a statement that it “had previously been in contact with Malaysia Airlines's shareholders”. The Asian airline is owned by Malaysia's sovereign wealth fund Khazanah, which last summer appointed Morgan Stanley to explore strategic options to turn the beleaguered flag carrier around. A Reuters report had suggested that Air France-KLM had proposed buying 49% of Malaysia Airlines. The same report alleged that Japan Airlines (JAL) was looking to acquire a 25% stake in the airline. The Oneworld alliance partners received regulatory approval last month to begin cooperating commercially on flights between Malaysia and Japan later this year. JAL has not stated publicly that it intends to acquire a stake in Malaysia Airlines. However, the carrier's president Yuji Akasaka told Cirium in June 2019 that “in terms of any investment, that is still under review and there is nothing to announce at this point, but there are some discussions that we can conduct going forward”. JAL could not be reached immediately for comment on the latest report. While Air France-KLM appears to have discounted the possibility of buying a stake, the carrier adds in its statement that it “continues to study global investment opportunities per its strategic goal to be an active yet pragmatic participant in industry consolidation”.",1,805,8.0,0.2158,"government, uk, carrier, business, state, share, south, airway, financial, plan","['respond', 'rumour', 'plan', 'acquire', 'stake', 'malaysia', 'franceklm', 'state', 'current', 'party', 'sale', 'process', 'kuala', 'lumpurbased', 'carrier', 'stage', 'however', 'francodutch', 'confirms', 'statement', 'previously', 'contact', 'malaysia', 'shareholder', 'asian', 'malaysia', 'sovereign', 'wealth', 'fund', 'khazanah', 'summer', 'appoint', 'morgan', 'stanley', 'explore', 'strategic', 'option', 'turn', 'beleaguer', 'flag', 'carrier', 'around', 'reuters', 'report', 'suggest', 'franceklm', 'propose', 'buying', 'malaysia', 'report', 'allege', 'japan', 'jal', 'look', 'acquire', 'stake', 'oneworld', 'alliance', 'partner', 'receive', 'regulatory', 'approval', 'month', 'begin', 'cooperate', 'commercially', 'malaysia', 'japan', 'later', 'jal', 'state', 'publicly', 'intend', 'acquire', 'stake', 'malaysia', 'however', 'carrier', 'president', 'yuji', 'akasaka', 'told', 'june', 'term', 'investment', 'still', 'review', 'nothing', 'announce', 'point', 'discussion', 'conduct', 'go', 'forward', 'jal', 'reach', 'immediately', 'comment', 'late', 'report', 'franceklm', 'appear', 'discount', 'possibility', 'buying', 'stake', 'carrier', 'add', 'statement', 'continue', 'study', 'global', 'investment', 'opportunity', 'per', 'strategic', 'goal', 'active', 'yet', 'pragmatic', 'participant', 'industry', 'consolidation']"
"Investigators from the Netherlands have defended their inquiry into a Turkish Airlines Boeing 737-800 crash near Amsterdam, after suggestions that the final report into the accident was watered-down in response to US remarks. The Dutch Safety Board, in its response, has published in full a human-factors analysis which contributed to the investigation and which, in particular, had highlighted concerns over a single-point failure path in the 737's radio altimeter. Single-point failure from an instrument, specifically the angle-of-attack sensor, has become a focus of the recent inquiries into the Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 737 Max accidents. In a 20 January article,The New York Times argued that the decision not to publish the human-factors analysis into the Turkish crash – combined with the incorporation of US representatives' remarks to the draft report – effectively deflected criticism of crucial aspects of Boeing's design choices a decade before the Max accidents. But the Dutch Safety Board has rejected any suggestion of yielding to pressure, insisting it is “strictly independent” in its investigative work. While US representatives, including Boeing, made 126 separate remarks to the draft report, these comments and the investigators' responses were fully and transparently documented in an appendix to the final report, it adds. This appendix, running to 79 pages, also contains 53 remarks from Turkish Airlines and the Turkish civil aviation regulator, as well as comments from several other parties – including French and UK investigators, and the European Union Aviation Safety Agency. The Dutch Safety Board states that the human-factors study was not published alongside the final report because “it was not the practice” at the time. “Current practice is different,” it says. “The [safety board] now publishes as much as possible.” Turkish Airlines flight TK1951 crashed during an ILS approach to Amsterdam Schiphol on 25 February 2009, after an incorrect left-hand radio altimeter reading activated an autothrottle mode which reduced engine thrust. The aircraft was descending at the time, in order to intercept the glideslope, and this “obscured” the autothrottle's mode switch – resulting in a speed decay, which the crew failed to notice, and a stall. Dutch Safety Board investigators pointed out that the first officer, who was flying, was following his primary flight instruments including height measured by the right-hand radio altimeter. But the left-hand radio altimeter, while reading incorrectly, did not categorise its reading as an error – which meant that, critically, it maintained control over various aircraft systems including the autothrottle. The crew was unaware of this and could not have known about it, the inquiry stated. The human-factors analysis states that the crew, which had switched to the right-hand autopilot and right-hand flight-control computer, “would have believed that they had protected their aircraft” from any problems with the left-hand radio altimeter. “What is not in Boeing 737 documentation and training available to pilots is that the autothrottle always gets its height information from the left radio altimeter,” it says. “The knowledge available through training and pilot documentation is so underspecified that it in fact can create a false or buggy mental model about the inter-relationships between the various automated systems and their sensor input.” In its final report the Dutch Safety Board did reference this peculiarity of design on the aircraft involved in the crash. “This is a relic from the Boeing 737, certificated long ago, which in the original design prioritised the provision of information to the [captain, seated on the left side],” it stated. “It is noticeable that this subject cannot be found in any of the Boeing 737 manuals or training documents for pilots. Pilots therefore do not have the correct knowledge about links between the control systems and data input for their own aircraft.” Risks of single-point failures are highlighted by the human-factors analysis. “The only defence against a designed-in single-failure path [is] the pilots who are warned to mistrust their machine and to stare at it harder,” it says. “Such a reminder, oriented only at the human operator in the system, is hardly credible after three decades of in-depth research into automated airliner flying and the subtle and pervasive ways in which automation on the flight deck – and particularly its subtle failure – affects human performance.” Crews would not have been insulated from the “automation surprise” which emerged on the Turkish Airlines, it adds, owing to an absence of sufficient training, written guidance or documentation, or line experience. The Dutch Safety Board insists its final report “clearly” shows the “main responsibility” for the loss of the Turkish aircraft “lies with Boeing”. It adds that the continuing investigation into the 737 Max accidents should include analysis of “whether sufficient lessons have been learned by Boeing and the US authorities” following its inquiry into the Turkish crash.",1,806,7.0,0.2983,"crew, runway, inquiry, land, approach, accident, investigator, captain, incident, pilot","['investigator', 'netherlands', 'defend', 'inquiry', 'turkish', 'crash', 'near', 'amsterdam', 'suggestion', 'final', 'report', 'accident', 'watereddown', 'response', 'u', 'remark', 'dutch', 'safety', 'board', 'response', 'publish', 'full', 'humanfactors', 'analysis', 'contribute', 'investigation', 'particular', 'highlight', 'concern', 'singlepoint', 'failure', 'path', 'radio', 'altimeter', 'singlepoint', 'failure', 'instrument', 'specifically', 'angleofattack', 'sensor', 'become', 'focus', 'recent', 'inquiry', 'lion', 'ethiopian', 'accident', 'january', 'article', 'york', 'argue', 'decision', 'publish', 'humanfactors', 'analysis', 'turkish', 'crash', 'combine', 'incorporation', 'u', 'representative', 'remark', 'draft', 'report', 'effectively', 'deflect', 'criticism', 'crucial', 'aspect', 'design', 'choice', 'decade', 'accident', 'dutch', 'safety', 'board', 'reject', 'suggestion', 'yield', 'pressure', 'insist', 'strictly', 'independent', 'investigative', 'work', 'u', 'representative', 'include', 'make', 'separate', 'remark', 'draft', 'report', 'comment', 'investigator', 'response', 'fully', 'transparently', 'document', 'appendix', 'final', 'report', 'add', 'appendix', 'run', 'page', 'contains', 'remark', 'turkish', 'turkish', 'civil', 'regulator', 'well', 'comment', 'several', 'party', 'include', 'french', 'uk', 'investigator', 'european', 'union', 'safety', 'agency', 'dutch', 'safety', 'board', 'state', 'humanfactors', 'study', 'publish', 'alongside', 'final', 'report', 'practice', 'current', 'practice', 'different', 'say', 'safety', 'board', 'publishes', 'much', 'turkish', 'crashed', 'il', 'approach', 'amsterdam', 'schiphol', 'february', 'incorrect', 'lefthand', 'radio', 'altimeter', 'reading', 'activate', 'autothrottle', 'mode', 'reduce', 'engine', 'thrust', 'descend', 'order', 'intercept', 'glideslope', 'obscure', 'autothrottle', 'mode', 'switch', 'result', 'speed', 'decay', 'crew', 'fail', 'notice', 'stall', 'dutch', 'safety', 'board', 'investigator', 'point', 'officer', 'fly', 'follow', 'primary', 'instrument', 'include', 'height', 'measure', 'righthand', 'radio', 'altimeter', 'lefthand', 'radio', 'altimeter', 'reading', 'incorrectly', 'categorise', 'reading', 'error', 'meant', 'critically', 'maintain', 'control', 'various', 'system', 'include', 'autothrottle', 'crew', 'unaware', 'know', 'inquiry', 'state', 'humanfactors', 'analysis', 'state', 'crew', 'switch', 'righthand', 'autopilot', 'righthand', 'flightcontrol', 'computer', 'believe', 'protect', 'problem', 'lefthand', 'radio', 'altimeter', 'documentation', 'training', 'available', 'pilot', 'autothrottle', 'always', 'get', 'height', 'information', 'left', 'radio', 'altimeter', 'say', 'knowledge', 'available', 'training', 'pilot', 'documentation', 'underspecified', 'fact', 'create', 'false', 'buggy', 'mental', 'model', 'interrelationship', 'various', 'automate', 'system', 'sensor', 'final', 'report', 'dutch', 'safety', 'board', 'reference', 'peculiarity', 'design', 'involve', 'crash', 'relic', 'certificate', 'long', 'ago', 'original', 'design', 'prioritise', 'provision', 'information', 'captain', 'seat', 'left', 'side', 'state', 'noticeable', 'subject', 'found', 'manual', 'training', 'document', 'pilot', 'pilot', 'therefore', 'correct', 'knowledge', 'link', 'control', 'system', 'data', 'input', 'risk', 'singlepoint', 'failure', 'highlight', 'humanfactors', 'analysis', 'defence', 'designedin', 'singlefailure', 'path', 'pilot', 'warn', 'mistrust', 'machine', 'stare', 'harder', 'say', 'reminder', 'orient', 'human', 'operator', 'system', 'hardly', 'credible', 'decade', 'indepth', 'research', 'automate', 'airliner', 'fly', 'subtle', 'pervasive', 'way', 'automation', 'deck', 'particularly', 'subtle', 'failure', 'affect', 'human', 'crew', 'insulate', 'automation', 'surprise', 'emerge', 'turkish', 'add', 'owe', 'absence', 'sufficient', 'training', 'write', 'guidance', 'documentation', 'line', 'experience', 'dutch', 'safety', 'board', 'insists', 'final', 'report', 'clearly', 'main', 'responsibility', 'loss', 'turkish', 'lie', 'add', 'continue', 'investigation', 'accident', 'include', 'analysis', 'whether', 'sufficient', 'lesson', 'learn', 'u', 'authority', 'follow', 'inquiry', 'turkish', 'crash']"
"Boeing has scheduled the 777X's maiden sortie for 23 January, an event that will finally kick off the revamped widebody's delayed flight-test programme and potentially keep the airframer on track to begin deliveries in early 2021. Under the manufacturer's current schedule, the 777-9 test aircraft should depart at around 10:00 Seattle time on the 23rd, although Boeing cautions that the timing “could change due to weather and other factors”. Getting the flight-test programme underway will mark a major milestone for Boeing, which has been hammered by a series of major issues, the most-prominent being the 737 Max's grounding. But the 777X programme has been beset by delays, and analysts have raised concerns about how quickly the Federal Aviation Administration, under extreme pressure to prevent a repeat of the 737 Max's certification issues, will approve the new big twin. Boeing launched development of the 777X, which has new GE Aviation GE9X powerplants, composite wings and folding wing-tips, at the Dubai air show in 2013. The two-aircraft family comprises the 426-seat 777-9 and the longer-range, 384-seat 777-8. Boeing initially planned to complete first flight of the 777-9 in 2019 and to begin deliveries in 2020. But an issue with the 105,000lb-thrust (467kN) GE9X powerplants stymied Boeing's plan. GE disclosed the issue, which involved stator vanes at the front of the engine's high-pressure compressor, at the Paris air show last year. A “durability issue” with those vanes, which pivot on a bearing to keep the engine running at peak performance, was causing hotter-than-expected exhaust gas temperatures, resulting in unexpected component degradation, according to GE. The engine maker recalled four GE9X powerplants from Boeing in 2019, forcing the airframer to delay first flight. GE says it has now fixed the issue. Also in 2019, Boeing announced it had shelved 777-8 development until a later, undisclosed date. The company has struggled to land significant numbers of 777X sales, with firm orders standing at 309 aircraft, according to Boeing data. Industry analysts attribute the modest sales partly to the current phase of airlines' fleet replacement cycles, noting that many airlines have recently completed widebody purchases. However, the consensus view is that 777X orders will increase by the middle of the decade",1,807,0.0,0.2337,"order, business, jet, delivery, production, customer, deliver, commercial, quarter, include","['schedule', 'maiden', 'sortie', 'january', 'event', 'finally', 'kick', 'revamped', 'widebody', 'delayed', 'flighttest', 'programme', 'potentially', 'keep', 'airframer', 'track', 'begin', 'delivery', 'early', 'manufacturer', 'current', 'schedule', 'test', 'depart', 'around', 'seattle', 'although', 'caution', 'timing', 'change', 'due', 'weather', 'factor', 'get', 'flighttest', 'programme', 'underway', 'mark', 'major', 'milestone', 'hammer', 'series', 'major', 'issue', 'mostprominent', 'ground', 'programme', 'beset', 'delay', 'analyst', 'raise', 'concern', 'quickly', 'federal', 'administration', 'extreme', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'repeat', 'certification', 'issue', 'approve', 'big', 'twin', 'launch', 'development', 'ge', 'powerplants', 'composite', 'wing', 'fold', 'wingtips', 'dubai', 'twoaircraft', 'family', 'comprises', 'longerrange', 'initially', 'plan', 'complete', 'begin', 'delivery', 'issue', 'powerplants', 'stymie', 'plan', 'ge', 'disclose', 'issue', 'involve', 'stator', 'vane', 'front', 'engine', 'highpressure', 'compressor', 'paris', 'durability', 'issue', 'vane', 'pivot', 'bearing', 'keep', 'engine', 'run', 'peak', 'performance', 'cause', 'hotterthanexpected', 'exhaust', 'gas', 'temperature', 'result', 'unexpected', 'component', 'degradation', 'accord', 'ge', 'engine', 'maker', 'recall', 'powerplants', 'force', 'airframer', 'delay', 'ge', 'say', 'fix', 'issue', 'announce', 'shelve', 'development', 'later', 'undisclosed', 'date', 'struggle', 'land', 'significant', 'number', 'sale', 'firm', 'order', 'stand', 'accord', 'data', 'industry', 'analyst', 'attribute', 'modest', 'sale', 'partly', 'current', 'phase', 'fleet', 'replacement', 'cycle', 'note', 'many', 'recently', 'complete', 'widebody', 'purchase', 'however', 'consensus', 'view', 'order', 'increase', 'middle', 'decade']"
"Iranian investigators have disclosed that two missiles from a Tor-M1 anti-aircraft system were fired before the loss of a Ukraine International Airlines Boeing 737-800 shortly after departure from Tehran. The Civil Aviation Organisation states that secondary radar contact with flight PS752 was initially lost at 06:15, about 3min after take-off, as the aircraft climbed through 8,100ft having been cleared to 26,000ft. But Mehrabad primary surveillance radar was able to continue tracking the aircraft as it made a right turn. The inquiry says this turn was “possibly towards the airport”, although it has not indicated whether the jet was under control or whether the turn was intentional. After a further 3min of flight, at 06:18, radar contact was lost completely. The aircraft came down about 9nm north-north-west of the airport, carving a track on a heading of about 160° through an ornamental park and a football playing field as it disintegrated. The inquiry says specific tests have been requested by investigators on aircraft components to explore any evidence of fuselage and other structural impact from a foreign object, in relation to the possible influence of “missile defence operations” on the accident. Investigators have received information that two missiles from a Tor-M1 system – known to NATO as the SA-15 Gauntlet, and which uses a 9M331 surface-to-air weapon – were fired towards the aircraft from the north. “The impact of these missiles on the accident and analysis of this action are under investigation,” the inquiry says. It has detailed the preparations for the 8 January flight to Kiev, stating that the aircraft was replenished with 9,510kg of fuel. But a load sheet calculation showed the maximum weight for the aircraft needed to be 72.5t, and that 82 items in the baggage hold – equating to 2,094kg of the overall 6,794kg of baggage – were offloaded in order to meet the criteria, bringing the 737's weight down such that it was 32kg below the maximum. This offloading resulted in a delay to the departure. The flight, parked on stand 116R, had been scheduled for 05:15 but the aircraft's doors were not closed until 05:49. The inquiry says 167 passengers had boarded, with one no-show. Shortly afterwards the aircraft was cleared for pushback and it eventually took off at 06:12 from runway 29R. Mehrabad radar control, with which the airport tower had previously co-ordinated the flight, contacted the crew and cleared it to climb to 26,000ft. The departure route required the crew to perform a right turn after reaching 6,000ft and proceed direct to the waypoint PAROT located 75nm north-north-west of Imam Khomeini airport. The crew read back the instructions. But from 06:18, says the inquiry, the radar controller informed the crew that he had lost contact. No response from the aircraft was received, and no transmissions were made from the crew indicating any unusual circumstances. Although one of the aircraft's emergency locator transmitters activated, its antenna had become detached during the accident. Both flight recorders were retrieved, with their memory modules, but both sustained fire and impact damage. Investigators state that a special task force, to explore unusual circumstances, has conducted tests for radiation and explosives. Analysis of luggage “reinforces the suspicion” that the presence of explosives should be probed. Three experienced pilots had been on board the aircraft. The inquiry says the captain had 5,469h on type out of a total of 11,600h, while the first officer had 7,600h in total with 3,642h on type. They were supported by an instructor with 6,600h on type from 12,000h overall.",1,808,7.0,0.3412,"crew, runway, inquiry, land, approach, accident, investigator, captain, incident, pilot","['iranian', 'investigator', 'disclose', 'missile', 'antiaircraft', 'system', 'fire', 'loss', 'ukraine', 'international', 'shortly', 'departure', 'tehran', 'civil', 'organisation', 'state', 'secondary', 'radar', 'contact', 'initially', 'lose', 'takeoff', 'climbed', 'clear', 'mehrabad', 'primary', 'surveillance', 'radar', 'able', 'continue', 'track', 'make', 'right', 'turn', 'inquiry', 'say', 'turn', 'possibly', 'towards', 'airport', 'although', 'indicate', 'whether', 'jet', 'control', 'whether', 'turn', 'intentional', 'far', 'radar', 'contact', 'lose', 'completely', 'come', 'northnorthwest', 'airport', 'carve', 'track', 'head', 'ornamental', 'park', 'football', 'play', 'field', 'disintegrate', 'inquiry', 'say', 'specific', 'test', 'request', 'investigator', 'component', 'explore', 'evidence', 'fuselage', 'structural', 'impact', 'foreign', 'object', 'relation', 'possible', 'influence', 'missile', 'defence', 'operation', 'accident', 'investigator', 'receive', 'information', 'missile', 'system', 'know', 'nato', 'gauntlet', 'surfacetoair', 'weapon', 'fire', 'towards', 'north', 'impact', 'missile', 'accident', 'analysis', 'action', 'investigation', 'inquiry', 'say', 'detailed', 'preparation', 'january', 'kiev', 'state', 'replenish', 'fuel', 'load', 'sheet', 'calculation', 'maximum', 'weight', 'need', 'item', 'baggage', 'hold', 'equate', 'overall', 'baggage', 'offload', 'order', 'meet', 'criterion', 'bring', 'weight', 'maximum', 'offload', 'result', 'delay', 'departure', 'park', 'stand', 'schedule', 'door', 'close', 'inquiry', 'say', 'passenger', 'board', 'noshow', 'shortly', 'afterwards', 'clear', 'pushback', 'eventually', 'take', 'runway', 'mehrabad', 'radar', 'control', 'airport', 'tower', 'previously', 'coordinate', 'contact', 'crew', 'clear', 'climb', 'departure', 'route', 'require', 'crew', 'perform', 'right', 'turn', 'reach', 'proceed', 'direct', 'waypoint', 'parot', 'locate', 'northnorthwest', 'imam', 'khomeini', 'airport', 'crew', 'read', 'back', 'instruction', 'say', 'inquiry', 'radar', 'controller', 'inform', 'crew', 'lose', 'contact', 'response', 'receive', 'transmission', 'make', 'crew', 'indicate', 'unusual', 'circumstance', 'although', 'emergency', 'locator', 'transmitter', 'activate', 'antenna', 'become', 'detach', 'accident', 'recorder', 'retrieve', 'memory', 'module', 'sustain', 'fire', 'impact', 'damage', 'investigator', 'state', 'special', 'task', 'force', 'explore', 'unusual', 'circumstance', 'conduct', 'test', 'radiation', 'explosive', 'analysis', 'luggage', 'reinforces', 'suspicion', 'presence', 'explosive', 'probed', 'experienced', 'pilot', 'board', 'inquiry', 'say', 'captain', 'type', 'total', 'officer', 'total', 'type', 'support', 'instructor', 'type', 'overall']"
"Kazakhstan's civil aviation administration has revealed a damning list of flaws in Bek Air's flight operations and maintenance processes, to justify the carrier's grounding. One of Bek Air's Fokker 100s crashed on take-off from Almaty on 27 December, resulting in the enforced suspension of the airline's operation – a measure which the airline had argued was illegal. But the Aviation Administration of Kazakhstan states that Bek Air has not only suffered two major incidents in the past three years, but experienced a “significantly higher than acceptable” level of serious safety problems over this period. It adds that a detailed probe of the carrier was initiated after its suspension, during which “a number of violations” was uncovered. Two of these have raised particular concern with the administration. It states that Bek Air has not conducted full and proper accounting of maintenance processes, particularly regarding the transfer of components between its aircraft. This suggests there are uncertainties over the actual usage time of components compared with their recorded time in operation. “It also indicates the inability of Bek Air to obtain spare parts, owing to lack of funding or the difficulty of acquiring spare parts for old aircraft,” says the administration. Cirium fleets data lists Bek Air as having nine Fokker 100s, powered by Rolls-Royce Tay engines, with the airframes dating between 1989 and 1995. But the more serious finding, says the administration, centres on the removal of serial number data plates from aircraft engines. “The identification of the engines cannot be verified, nor can their actual hours and cycles be verified,” it states. “Several engines with such problems have been identified, casting doubt on the suitability of all of the aircraft engines operated by Bek Air.” Rolls-Royce has confirmed there is no procedure for removing the data plates, the administration says, and the manufacturer has not received any information about overhaul of the carrier's Tay engines since they were put into operation in Kazakhstan. Bek Air's flight operations have also raised concern. Icing remains a prime suspect in the Almaty accident and Fokker 100 procedures dictate that the wing surfaces must be specifically checked at three points for ice. But the administration says studies of video evidence at the airport indicates that Bek Air crews generally did not carry out these wing checks. It has identified shortcomings relating to documentation of training, and says there is no evidence of specific training for winter operations or icing risk management. “Given the nature of aircraft operation in the Kazakhstan winter, this is a serious safety issue,” it adds. Inspection of the carrier has also turned up other violations with life jackets, emergency locator transmitters, and a lack of fire protection in cargo compartments. “In general, the state of the fleet is unsatisfactory,” the administration says. Bek Air will be instructed, within 10 days of the inspection work concluding, to submit a corrective action plan to eliminate all the problems.

"Air Lease executive chairman Steven Udvar-Hazy believe Boeing should drop the word “Max” from the name of its latest Boeing 737 family, following two fatal crashes and the subsequent grounding. “We've asked Boeing to get rid of that word Max,” Udvar-Hazy said at the Airline Economics Growth Frontiers conference in Dublin today. “There's no reason why Boeing can't call it a 737-8 , 737-9, 737-7.” He adds: “The Max brand is damaged and there's no reference to Max in any of the documentation that Boeing submitted to the regulators, it's just the 737.” Calling the Max grounding a crisis “unprecedented in my 50 years in aviation”, Udvar-Hazy notes that it remains unclear when the Max will be approved by regulators to return to service, although he is hopeful that it could be within the next 90 days, albeit that “it almost feels like every week there are new developments that cause us to be concerned about the timeliness of return to service”. Once the Max does return to the skies, passengers may be hesitant to fly on the aircraft, Udvar-Hazy suggests – a factor likely to vary from market to market. Renaming the aircraft could help to overcome some of these fears, he argues. Boeing will likely deliver around 50-60 Max jets per month once it is given the all-clear, including new-builds and aircraft from storage, he expects. This number, in his view, is low enough to avoid flooding the market with new capacity and driving down aircraft valuations. Air Lease has 42 Max aircraft, 15 of which were delivered prior to the grounding. The remaining 27 aircraft have been built for Air Lease customers since the grounding but remain undelivered. In total, this represents over $2 billion-worth of aircraft that are not able to fly. A further 15 Max jets are scheduled for delivery to Air Lease customers this year. Udvar-Hazy adds that while lease rates for the Max have been damaged by the grounding, values will likely return to normal by around 2021. “When we signed our [Max] leases rates before the accidents, they were running generally 10-15% higher than the aircraft they were replacing [Airbus A320s and 737NGs],” he explains. “No question there'll be a temporary dip on the lease-rate values,” he adds, although Airbus is unable to supply all the new capacity that the market requires, which will support lease valuations in the longer term.",1,810,2.0,0.1828,"executive, chief, cut, add, situation, staff, crisis, make, coronavirus, employee","['lease', 'executive', 'chairman', 'steven', 'udvarhazy', 'believe', 'drop', 'word', 'name', 'late', 'family', 'follow', 'fatal', 'crash', 'subsequent', 'ground', 'ask', 'get', 'rid', 'word', 'udvarhazy', 'say', 'economics', 'growth', 'frontier', 'conference', 'dublin', 'today', 'reason', 'ca', 'call', 'add', 'brand', 'damage', 'reference', 'documentation', 'submit', 'regulator', 'call', 'ground', 'crisis', 'unprecedented', 'udvarhazy', 'note', 'remains', 'unclear', 'approve', 'regulator', 'return', 'service', 'although', 'hopeful', 'within', 'next', 'day', 'albeit', 'almost', 'feel', 'like', 'every', 'week', 'development', 'cause', 'u', 'concerned', 'timeliness', 'return', 'service', 'return', 'sky', 'passenger', 'may', 'hesitant', 'fly', 'udvarhazy', 'suggests', 'factor', 'likely', 'vary', 'market', 'market', 'rename', 'help', 'overcome', 'fear', 'argues', 'likely', 'deliver', 'around', 'jet', 'per', 'month', 'give', 'allclear', 'include', 'newbuilds', 'storage', 'expect', 'number', 'view', 'low', 'enough', 'avoid', 'flood', 'market', 'capacity', 'drive', 'valuation', 'lease', 'deliver', 'prior', 'ground', 'remain', 'built', 'lease', 'customer', 'since', 'ground', 'remain', 'undelivered', 'total', 'represent', 'billionworth', 'able', 'fly', 'far', 'jet', 'schedule', 'delivery', 'lease', 'customer', 'udvarhazy', 'add', 'lease', 'rate', 'damage', 'ground', 'value', 'likely', 'return', 'normal', 'around', 'sign', 'lease', 'rate', 'accident', 'run', 'generally', 'high', 'replace', 'explains', 'question', 'temporary', 'dip', 'leaserate', 'value', 'add', 'although', 'unable', 'supply', 'capacity', 'market', 'require', 'support', 'lease', 'valuation', 'longer', 'term']"
"Investigators have determined that a WestJet Encore Bombardier Q400 suffered damage at Edmonton after de-rotating sharply during a high-speed landing. The Q400 – arriving from Fort McMurray on 19 July last year – had been approaching Edmonton's runway 12 with storms in the vicinity of the airport. Its captain opted for a high approach speed of 142kt, about 20kt above the reference, owing to the possibility of a missed approach and the risk of windshear. The crew also planned a “firm landing”, says the Transportation Safety Board of Canada, because of gusting conditions. Flight-data recorder information shows the Q400 did not reduce speed before touchdown and the aircraft's main landing-gear sensors briefly switched from ground mode, after touchdown, back to air mode. The captain then made a full nose-down input to the control column, and the aircraft sharply de-rotated – by 10°/s rather than the typical 4°/s. This was followed by a “bang” and a nose-wheel shimmy, says the inquiry, and the aircraft pulled to the left during roll-out. Analysis of flight-recorder data shows both the main and nose landing-gear switched to ground mode “nearly simultaneously”, it adds. While no hard landing was indicated to the pilots, they requested maintenance support after taxiing off the runway – although personnel could not attend for 45min owing to a lightning alert. Both nose-gear tyres were changed before the aircraft taxied to the gate to disembark passengers. Further detailed inspection showed the aircraft had sustained substantial fuselage skin wrinkling on its nose as well as damage to the nose-gear door, nose-gear assembly, and forward bulkhead. None of the 74 occupants was injured. WestJet Encore's operating manual states that crews should add half the gust factor – to a maximum of 10kt – to the normal approach speed when flying in gusting conditions. This should have resulted in the Q400's flying at 135kt, and reducing speed to the reference of 122kt at touchdown. The nose-wheel should then have been “promptly” brought into contact with the ground after the main-gear touchdown, says the inquiry. It states that the damage to the aircraft (C-FKWE) occurred when the nose of the aircraft was lowered at a higher rate than normal, following the high-speed touchdown, and adds that the accident highlights the “importance of flight crews' adhering to operational procedures and techniques”.",1,811,7.0,0.5744,"crew, runway, inquiry, land, approach, accident, investigator, captain, incident, pilot","['investigator', 'determine', 'westjet', 'encore', 'bombardier', 'suffer', 'damage', 'edmonton', 'derotating', 'sharply', 'highspeed', 'land', 'arrive', 'fort', 'mcmurray', 'july', 'approach', 'edmonton', 'runway', 'storm', 'vicinity', 'airport', 'captain', 'opt', 'high', 'approach', 'speed', 'reference', 'owe', 'possibility', 'miss', 'approach', 'risk', 'windshear', 'crew', 'plan', 'firm', 'land', 'say', 'transportation', 'safety', 'board', 'canada', 'gusting', 'condition', 'flightdata', 'recorder', 'information', 'reduce', 'speed', 'touchdown', 'main', 'landinggear', 'sensor', 'briefly', 'switch', 'ground', 'mode', 'touchdown', 'back', 'mode', 'captain', 'make', 'full', 'nosedown', 'input', 'control', 'column', 'sharply', 'derotated', 'rather', 'typical', 'follow', 'bang', 'nosewheel', 'shimmy', 'say', 'inquiry', 'pull', 'left', 'rollout', 'analysis', 'flightrecorder', 'data', 'main', 'nose', 'landinggear', 'switch', 'ground', 'mode', 'nearly', 'simultaneously', 'add', 'hard', 'land', 'indicate', 'pilot', 'request', 'maintenance', 'support', 'taxi', 'runway', 'although', 'personnel', 'attend', 'owe', 'lightning', 'alert', 'nosegear', 'tyre', 'change', 'taxi', 'gate', 'disembark', 'passenger', 'far', 'detailed', 'inspection', 'sustain', 'substantial', 'fuselage', 'skin', 'wrinkle', 'nose', 'well', 'damage', 'nosegear', 'door', 'nosegear', 'assembly', 'forward', 'bulkhead', 'none', 'occupant', 'injured', 'westjet', 'encore', 'operating', 'manual', 'state', 'crew', 'add', 'half', 'gust', 'factor', 'maximum', 'normal', 'approach', 'speed', 'fly', 'gusting', 'condition', 'result', 'fly', 'reduce', 'speed', 'reference', 'touchdown', 'nosewheel', 'promptly', 'brought', 'contact', 'ground', 'maingear', 'touchdown', 'say', 'inquiry', 'state', 'damage', 'cfkwe', 'occur', 'nose', 'lower', 'high', 'rate', 'normal', 'follow', 'highspeed', 'touchdown', 'add', 'accident', 'highlight', 'importance', 'crew', 'adhere', 'operational', 'procedure', 'technique']"
"IATA has recalled the designator code for Kazakh carrier Bek Air, three weeks after a fatal take-off accident led to an enforced suspension of the carrier's operations. Bek Air has filed an appeal against the suspension, claiming that the decision is illegal. The airline had been operating under the 'Z9' designator code. But IATA formally notified the airline, on 17 January, that it was recalling the code with immediate effect because the company “no longer meets the qualifications” to retain it, and that it would be made available to other qualifying operators in 60 days' time. Bek Air could secure reassignment of the code within this period if it proves itself eligible and settles any outstanding balances with IATA. The carrier is appealing the suspension which followed the 27 December accident at Almaty. Bek Air argues that the commission investigating the crash, which resulted in 12 fatalities, has yet to reach conclusions, and has been considering various possible scenarios including improper loading and balance, crew handling errors, technical failure, and the effect of weather conditions – including icing. As a result, it states, the decision by Kazakh civil aviation regulators on 27 December to suspend the airline's certificate, until further notice, is “premature”. It says the decision “cannot be recognised as reasonable and legal”, adding that the communication on the suspension gives “no explanation” for it. This failure to indicate the specific breaches by the operator that justify the suspension amount to a “gross violation” of the procedure for carrying out the sanction, the airline states, and therefore the suspension itself is “illegal and must be cancelled”.",1,812,10.0,0.2055,"international, authority, civil, state, investigation, case, add, january, airasia, crash","['iata', 'recall', 'designator', 'code', 'kazakh', 'carrier', 'bek', 'week', 'fatal', 'takeoff', 'accident', 'lead', 'enforce', 'suspension', 'carrier', 'operation', 'bek', 'file', 'appeal', 'suspension', 'claim', 'decision', 'illegal', 'operating', 'designator', 'code', 'iata', 'formally', 'notify', 'january', 'recall', 'code', 'immediate', 'effect', 'longer', 'meet', 'qualification', 'retain', 'make', 'available', 'qualify', 'operator', 'day', 'bek', 'secure', 'reassignment', 'code', 'within', 'period', 'prof', 'eligible', 'settle', 'outstanding', 'balance', 'iata', 'carrier', 'appeal', 'suspension', 'follow', 'december', 'accident', 'almaty', 'bek', 'argues', 'commission', 'investigate', 'crash', 'result', 'fatality', 'yet', 'reach', 'conclusion', 'consider', 'various', 'possible', 'scenario', 'include', 'improper', 'load', 'balance', 'crew', 'handle', 'error', 'technical', 'failure', 'effect', 'weather', 'condition', 'include', 'ice', 'result', 'state', 'decision', 'kazakh', 'civil', 'regulator', 'december', 'suspend', 'certificate', 'far', 'notice', 'premature', 'say', 'decision', 'recognise', 'reasonable', 'legal', 'add', 'communication', 'suspension', 'give', 'explanation', 'failure', 'indicate', 'specific', 'breach', 'operator', 'justify', 'suspension', 'amount', 'gross', 'violation', 'procedure', 'carry', 'sanction', 'state', 'therefore', 'suspension', 'illegal', 'must', 'cancel']"
"French investigators have disclosed that they are probing a substantial loss of altitude by an Air Algerie Boeing 737-800 during a go-around at Paris Orly last month. The aircraft, arriving from Tlemcen in north-western Algeria on 6 December, had been established on the localiser of runway 25. French investigation authority BEA says an airport bird-control vehicle had approached the runway from taxiway W33, which intersects about 800m from the threshold. Although the vehicle came to a halt at the edge of the runway, an incursion alert was triggered while the 737 was on short final. The controller ordered the aircraft to abort the approach and execute a go-around. BEA says the aircraft climbed along the runway centreline to 2,000ft and commenced a left turn. But while the jet progressed with the turn, the inquiry says, it lost altitude and descended to 1,250ft before climbing again to 3,000ft. Meteorological data for Paris Orly at the time indicates reduced visibility as a result of rain and mist. BEA says the crew conducted another approach and landed without further incident.

Russia's federal Investigative Committee's West Siberian transport division states that preliminary information indicates that an “ignition of accumulated aviation fuel” occurred as the parked aircraft's engines started. Exhaust gas temperature sensors were triggered, it adds, and the crew activated the engine's fire-extinguishing system.

"Boeing has identified a problem with the software on the 737 Max designed to monitor the performance of other systems during aircraft startup, adding another hitch to the Max's return-to-service. The issue is relatively minor, according to an aviation safety expert, and unrelated to the flight control system implicated as a factor leading to two crashes. Boeing says it is working to fix the problem, which came to light during a final review of the Max by the Federal Aviation Administration prior to certification. “We are aware of this issue,” Boeing says in a 17 January statement. “We are making necessary updates and working with the FAA on submission of this change, and keeping our customers informed.” The FAA did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The issue involves software that monitors various other systems. It ensures those systems properly come on line at startup when electricity is run through the aircraft, either via ground power or using the Max's auxiliary power unit, according to Boeing and sources familiar with the issue. One of the system's monitors was found to be functioning incorrectly, Boeing says. John Goglia, an aviation safety expert, former airline mechanic and former member of the National Transportation Safety Board, describes the issue as minor. He says that if the software system failed to detect an issue with the Max's systems, pilots would still likely receive an indication of that fault in the cockpit.

"Sikorsky and Boeing are continuing to flight test the SB-1 Defiant compound helicopter, recently pushing the demonstrator aircraft to speeds greater than 100kt (185km/h). Video released by the joint Sikorsky-Boeing team on 17 January helped quell questions about the development and test helicopter's status, which has been in doubt since gearbox troubles put it behind schedule. Additional uncertainty arose when the US Army announced in 2019 that it stopped funding its Joint Multi-Role Technology Demonstration (JMR-TD) programme. The SB-1 was developed through the US Army's Future Vertical Lift programme, of which JMR-TD was one portion. The SB-1's chief competitor, the Bell V-280 Valor tiltrotor, had accumulated more than 150h of flight time over two years as of December 2019. Sikorsky and Boeing did not disclose how many hours the Defiant demonstrator had logged. “The Sikorsky-Boeing SB-1 Defiant continues to expand its flight envelope through sorties each week, executing the mission elements required for Future Vertical Lift, most recently exceeding 100kt and performing maneuvers at 30° angle of bank at the Sikorsky Development Flight Test Center in West Palm Beach, Florida,” the companies say. The Sikorsky-Boeing team said in October 2019 they planned to increase the SB-1's speed during test flights in 40kt increments until reaching 230kt by the end of the first quarter in 2020. At the NASA Ames Research Center, a subscale Defiant model has been successfully tested at 250kt, the companies said. With the JMR-TD programme wrapped up, the US Army has shifted focus to its final competition to replace its workhorse Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk.

"A Delta Airlines Airbus A319 slid off a taxiway in Kansas City while taxiing in bad weather on Friday, leading the airport to temporarily cease operations due to deteriorating winter conditions. Delta's flight 1114, bound for Detroit, exited the taxiway pavement, the airport's marketing manager Joe McBride, says in a tweet. “Passengers were safely offloaded and bused to Terminal B. Crews will remove the aircraft sometime today,” he said in a tweet. “It is not impeding much of the airfield.” The aircraft was carrying 149 passengers and crew. There were no known injuries, McBride says. The Federal Aviation Administration confirmed the details of the reports, adding that ”FAA investigators are at the accident site, and the National Transportation Safety Board has been notified”. The airport announced at 11:55am local time on twitter that it had re-opened, and that “conditions are improving so we hope we do not again have to close the airfield for safety today.” Winter weather forecasted for this weekend has prompted several airlines to waive fees for changes to travel itineraries across the Midwest and eastern United States. Much of the eastern half of the country is under a “winter weather alert” as a heavy snowstorm threatens to disrupt travel over the long holiday weekend. The incident in Kansas City was the second this week involving a Delta aircraft. On Tuesday, a Delta jet bound for Shanghai dumped fuel over a densely populated area of Los Angeles, dousing tens of schoolchildren and adults as it returned to the Los Angeles international airport after declaring an emergency due to an “engine issue”.",1,818,5.0,0.1677,"carrier, march, international, outbreak, suspend, capacity, schedule, april, united, coronavirus","['delta', 'slid', 'taxiway', 'kansa', 'city', 'taxi', 'bad', 'weather', 'friday', 'lead', 'airport', 'temporarily', 'cease', 'operation', 'due', 'deteriorate', 'winter', 'condition', 'delta', 'bound', 'detroit', 'exit', 'taxiway', 'pavement', 'airport', 'marketing', 'manager', 'joe', 'mcbride', 'say', 'tweet', 'passenger', 'safely', 'offload', 'bus', 'terminal', 'b', 'crew', 'remove', 'sometime', 'today', 'say', 'tweet', 'impede', 'much', 'carry', 'passenger', 'crew', 'know', 'injury', 'mcbride', 'say', 'federal', 'administration', 'confirm', 'detail', 'report', 'add', 'faa', 'investigator', 'accident', 'site', 'national', 'transportation', 'safety', 'board', 'notify', 'airport', 'announce', 'local', 'twitter', 'reopen', 'condition', 'improve', 'hope', 'close', 'airfield', 'safety', 'winter', 'weather', 'forecast', 'weekend', 'prompt', 'several', 'waive', 'fee', 'change', 'travel', 'itinerary', 'across', 'midwest', 'eastern', 'united', 'state', 'much', 'eastern', 'half', 'country', 'winter', 'weather', 'alert', 'heavy', 'snowstorm', 'threatens', 'disrupt', 'travel', 'long', 'holiday', 'weekend', 'incident', 'kansa', 'city', 'second', 'week', 'involve', 'delta', 'tuesday', 'delta', 'jet', 'bound', 'shanghai', 'dumped', 'fuel', 'densely', 'populate', 'area', 'los', 'angeles', 'douse', 'schoolchildren', 'adult', 'return', 'los', 'angeles', 'international', 'airport', 'declare', 'emergency', 'due', 'engine', 'issue']"
"Questions have emerged about one of the largest commitments for Bell's in-development 525 Relentless super-medium-twin, which has been on the manufacturer's books since 2015. Several sources indicate that lessor Milestone Aviation has backed away from a tentative deal for 20 units of the 525, likely due to development delays. Milestone, part of leasing giant GECAS, signed a letter of intent (LoI) for the 20 helicopters at the 2015 Paris air show; deliveries were due to commence in 2017. However, certification of the 525 has been repeatedly delayed due to Bell's struggles with the helicopter's development, compounded by the fatal crash of a fight-test prototype in 2016. Bell's most recent target was to achieve certification of the 9.2t Relentless in 2019, but the manufacturer has now stopped presenting a schedule for service entry. Despite repeated requests to clarify the status of its LoI, Milestone declines to say whether the commitment is still valid. “Milestone continues to work closely with Bell on a variety of opportunities. However, we are not in a position to discuss further details,” it says. For its part, Bell says: “Milestone Aviation signed an LoI, expressing their interest in the Bell 525 in 2015. Since then, the programme has been focused on FAA [Federal Aviation Administration] certification and entry into service. “Bell will continue to share customer interest with their consent, but Bell will not disclose the details of previously announced or future customer LoIs, including Milestone Aviation's, until certification.” In addition, the airframer says that “approximately six production aircraft” are in progress at the company's Amarillo, Texas, assembly facility. Powered by twin GE Aviation CT7 engines and featuring full fly-by-wire controls – a first for a commercial helicopter – the 525 has been designed principally for the oil and gas, search and rescue, and VIP transport markets. A serious downturn in the oil and gas segment, which has seen multiple operators seek Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, has resulted in significant helicopter over-capacity. Nonetheless, Bell insists that the 525 will make its commercial debut in the offshore transportation role.

"Flybe has dismissed suggestions by rivals Ryanair, EasyJet and IAG that the UK regional carrier is receiving unfair and illegal state subsidies, following the government's decision to provide a bailout package. Exeter-based Flybe asserts that media reporting of its bailout has been inaccurate, and says the payment plan agreed with UK tax authorities covers a debt of less than £10 million ($13 million). “This agreement will only last a matter of months before all taxes and duties are paid in full,” it adds. It stresses that this represents a standard “time to pay” agreement which any business in financial difficulties may use. The government has not revealed the terms of the rescue deal that has been agreed. It has been reported that Flybe will be allowed to defer handing over more than £100 million of air passenger duty (APD) it owes, and that the government will launch a review of UK domestic APD. Low-cost giantRyanair argues that any financial assistanceprovided to Flybe would constitute unfair state aid, and is threatening to challenge the decision in the UK and European courts. Speaking to the BBC this morning, Ryanair chairman Michael O'Leary said he “doesn't believe” the government's insistence that it is not offering state aid to Flybe. “The reason we don't believe them is they won't publish the deal,” he explained. IAG has complained to the EU about the bailout, while EasyJet has said it is inappropriate for taxpayers' money to be used to bail out individual companies, especially give the well-capitalised position of Flybe's owners.",1,820,8.0,0.4331,"government, uk, carrier, business, state, share, south, airway, financial, plan","['flybe', 'dismiss', 'suggestion', 'rival', 'ryanair', 'easyjet', 'iag', 'uk', 'regional', 'carrier', 'receive', 'unfair', 'illegal', 'state', 'subsidy', 'follow', 'government', 'decision', 'provide', 'bailout', 'package', 'exeterbased', 'flybe', 'asserts', 'medium', 'reporting', 'bailout', 'inaccurate', 'say', 'payment', 'plan', 'agree', 'uk', 'tax', 'authority', 'cover', 'debt', 'less', 'agreement', 'matter', 'month', 'tax', 'duty', 'paid', 'full', 'add', 'stress', 'represent', 'standard', 'pay', 'agreement', 'business', 'financial', 'difficulty', 'may', 'use', 'government', 'reveal', 'term', 'rescue', 'deal', 'agree', 'report', 'flybe', 'allow', 'defer', 'hand', 'passenger', 'duty', 'apd', 'owes', 'government', 'launch', 'review', 'uk', 'domestic', 'apd', 'lowcost', 'giantryanair', 'argues', 'financial', 'assistanceprovided', 'flybe', 'constitute', 'unfair', 'state', 'aid', 'threaten', 'challenge', 'decision', 'uk', 'european', 'court', 'speak', 'bbc', 'morning', 'ryanair', 'chairman', 'michael', 'say', 'believe', 'government', 'insistence', 'offering', 'state', 'aid', 'flybe', 'reason', 'believe', 'wo', 'publish', 'deal', 'explain', 'iag', 'complain', 'eu', 'bailout', 'easyjet', 'say', 'inappropriate', 'taxpayer', 'money', 'use', 'bail', 'individual', 'especially', 'give', 'wellcapitalised', 'position', 'flybe', 'owner']"
"IAG has disclosed that the proportion of its shares held by “non-EU persons” has declined to 39.5%, from 47.5% in February 2019, enabling the group to remove maximum limits on non-EU ownership that ensure regulators class it as a European airline. Ahead of Brexit on 31 January, IAG must ensure that it is majority-owned by EU citizens in order to maintain its European operating rights. Limits were placed on the number of non-EU shares that could be held in order to ensure this criteria was met. IAG says it will continue to monitor the non-EU ownership level, and could reintroduce limits if it threatens to rise above 50%.

"Collapsed Slovenian flag-carrier Adria Airways' air operator's certificate is set to be auctioned on 23 January, and the administrator for the bankrupt company is formally inviting bids. The invitation says the lot being presented for auction effectively amounts to the whole business of Adria, in particular all permits to operate air services – including the AOC. It warns that the buyer will need to obtain other required licences before commencing commercial air transport, in accordance with European Commission regulations. The buyer must also be prepared to “remedy” at its own expense any legal “discrepancies” arising from previous decisions by Slovenia's civil aviation authority to suspend the carrier's certificate, it adds. Bidders will be expected to offer a starting price of €45,000 for the assets under auction, increasing by €500 steps. The auction will take place at the Adria Airways office in Ljubljana airport, says administrator Janez Pustaticnik. There is evidence that interested bidders will include investors linked to a plan to use premium-configured Sukhoi Superjet 100s, fitted with 56 seats, to compete against Lufthansa and Swiss on routes to Zurich, Munich and Frankurt. This plan, according to a representative for the investor group, would also use 87-seat Superjets to offer flights to holiday destinations, including locations in Austria.

"Romania's government has discussed allocating critical financial support to ailing flag-carrier Tarom during a meeting on 16 January. Transport minister Lucian Bode had asked prime minister Ludovic Orban to approve a draft memorandum for granting rescue aid, supplemented with restructuring aid, for 2020. After the meeting the head of the prime minister's chancellery, Ionel Danca, gave a briefing during which he stated that the rescue aid will amount to 195 million lei ($45 million). Danca says that, in the absence of the funding, “it would be impossible [for Tarom] to finance current activity” from March. Orban indicates that discussions have already been conducted at European Commission level, with new vice-president Margrethe Vestager, who was formerly the competition commissioner under Jean-Claude Juncker's presidency. Transport minister Bode had already warned that the airline was facing a crisis, telling a television station in December that it was likely to lose 190 million lei for 2019, and that it was looking for €47 million ($52 million) in rescue aid as part of a €110 million restructuring package.",1,823,8.0,0.3128,"government, uk, carrier, business, state, share, south, airway, financial, plan","['romania', 'government', 'discuss', 'allocate', 'critical', 'financial', 'support', 'ail', 'flagcarrier', 'tarom', 'meeting', 'january', 'transport', 'minister', 'lucian', 'bode', 'ask', 'prime', 'minister', 'ludovic', 'orban', 'approve', 'draft', 'memorandum', 'grant', 'rescue', 'aid', 'supplement', 'restructuring', 'aid', 'meeting', 'head', 'prime', 'minister', 'chancellery', 'ionel', 'danca', 'give', 'briefing', 'state', 'rescue', 'aid', 'amount', 'lei', 'danca', 'say', 'absence', 'funding', 'impossible', 'tarom', 'finance', 'current', 'activity', 'march', 'orban', 'indicates', 'discussion', 'already', 'conduct', 'european', 'commission', 'level', 'vicepresident', 'margrethe', 'vestager', 'formerly', 'competition', 'commissioner', 'jeanclaude', 'juncker', 'presidency', 'transport', 'minister', 'bode', 'already', 'warn', 'face', 'crisis', 'tell', 'television', 'station', 'december', 'likely', 'lose', 'lei', 'look', 'rescue', 'aid', 'part', 'restructuring', 'package']"
"The Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) is investigating missed approach procedures for Sydney's runway 34R following an air proximity incident between two Qantas jets. The incident occurred at 18:31 local time on 5 August 2019 and involved a departing Airbus A330-300 (VH-EBJ) and an arriving Boeing 737-800 (VH-VZO). The air proximity incident occurred as the 737-800 conducted a missed approach while the A330-300 took off. As the A330 lined up for take-off on a service to Melbourne, the 737 was on final approach. The A330, however, had to wait for a turboprop to clear the runway before commencing take-off. “The [Sydney aerodrome controller east] assessed that there would be insufficient runway spacing between the aircraft and instructed the 737 flight crew to 'go around,'” says the ATSB's preliminary report. “As the 737 flight crew conducted the missed approach, a loss of separation occurred between their aircraft and the departing A330. Flight data showed that separation between the aircraft reduced to about 0.43nm laterally and about 500ft vertically.” The controller, with both aircraft in sight, instructed the 737 crew to turn right, but the aircraft were converging and the A330 crew received an airborne collision avoidance system (ACAS) alert – 'TRAFFIC-TRAFFIC.' “The A330 first officer, who was pilot flying, then saw the 737 in close proximity and, in response, reduced the aircraft's angle of bank to reduce the turn towards the 737,” says the report. “The captain of the A330 made a radio transmission to advise the ADC-E controller that it was 'very close'. The controller then issued an instruction to the A330 flight crew to turn left.” The A330 continued its journey without further incident, and the 737 landed on 34R after its second approach. Following the incident, the ATSB is looking at a range of elements such as the design and risk assessment of missed approaches from runway 34R, air traffic control (ATC) procedures, operator procedures, the coding of flight management system navigation databases, as well as flight data and ATC recordings. Qantas, for its part, issued a brief statement about the incident: “Our crew followed directions from air traffic control at all times. We're continuing to work with the ATSB on their ongoing investigation.”",1,824,7.0,0.4305,"crew, runway, inquiry, land, approach, accident, investigator, captain, incident, pilot","['australian', 'transport', 'safety', 'bureau', 'atsb', 'investigate', 'miss', 'approach', 'procedure', 'sydney', 'runway', 'follow', 'proximity', 'incident', 'qantas', 'jet', 'incident', 'occur', 'local', 'august', 'involve', 'depart', 'vhebj', 'arrive', 'vhvzo', 'proximity', 'incident', 'occur', 'conduct', 'miss', 'approach', 'take', 'line', 'takeoff', 'service', 'melbourne', 'final', 'approach', 'however', 'wait', 'turboprop', 'clear', 'runway', 'commence', 'takeoff', 'sydney', 'aerodrome', 'controller', 'east', 'assess', 'insufficient', 'runway', 'space', 'instruct', 'crew', 'around', 'say', 'atsb', 'preliminary', 'report', 'crew', 'conduct', 'miss', 'approach', 'loss', 'separation', 'occur', 'depart', 'data', 'separation', 'reduce', 'laterally', 'controller', 'sight', 'instruct', 'crew', 'turn', 'right', 'converge', 'crew', 'receive', 'airborne', 'collision', 'avoidance', 'system', 'acas', 'alert', 'officer', 'pilot', 'fly', 'saw', 'close', 'proximity', 'response', 'reduce', 'angle', 'bank', 'reduce', 'turn', 'towards', 'say', 'report', 'captain', 'make', 'radio', 'transmission', 'advise', 'adce', 'controller', 'close', 'controller', 'issue', 'instruction', 'crew', 'turn', 'continued', 'journey', 'without', 'far', 'incident', 'land', 'second', 'approach', 'follow', 'incident', 'atsb', 'look', 'range', 'element', 'design', 'risk', 'assessment', 'miss', 'approach', 'runway', 'traffic', 'control', 'atc', 'procedure', 'operator', 'procedure', 'cod', 'management', 'system', 'navigation', 'database', 'well', 'data', 'atc', 'recording', 'qantas', 'part', 'issue', 'brief', 'statement', 'incident', 'crew', 'follow', 'direction', 'traffic', 'control', 'continue', 'work', 'atsb', 'ongoing', 'investigation']"
"Two identical serious take-off incidents within two weeks involving EasyJet Airbus A320s at Lisbon have spurred UK investigators to advise Portugal's airports operator to stop using confusing terminology for runway departure positions. Both incidents involved the aircraft accelerating with insufficient thrust and becoming airborne close to the far end of the runway. The UK Air Accidents Investigation Branch says an A320, bound for London Luton on 24 April last year, had intended a departure from the S1 intersection of Lisbon's runway 21. It states that – for “reasons described as historic” – the aeronautical information publication for Lisbon refers to runway take-off points as 'positions', unlike airports elsewhere. While calculating take-off performance criteria with the electronic flightbag, the pilots both based the calculation on the take-off position designated 'PSNSTMP' – for temporary position S – believing it to refer to the S1 intersection. But this designation actually stood for the S4 intersection, used for a full-length runway take-off of 3,805m, which would have allowed a lower thrust level. The crew did not cross-check the take-off distances available from the two positions and, as a result, failed to detect the error. Although the A320 ultimately departed from the nearby U5 intersection, the available take-off distance was still only 2,410m – nearly 1,400m less than the full-length runway. The incorrect performance calculation meant the A320's thrust was too low for the departure. Although the captain mentioned that the take-off roll “felt wrong”, says the inquiry, full take-off thrust was not selected. Flight-data recorder analysis shows the aircraft's ground roll was 1,860m and it lifted off about 400m from the runway end, overflying the upwind threshold at about 100ft. The incident involving aircraft G-EZTD was followed just 14 days later by an “identical” event, with another EasyJet A320 (OE-IJL) operating to Paris on 7 May took off 350m from the runway end. It crossed the threshold at 75ft. “Robust adherence to procedures is a key defence against such incidents occurring,” says the inquiry, pointing out that pilots often find reduced acceleration difficult to recognise. EasyJet has since taken steps to prevent a recurrence including issuing a notice to crews clarifying take-off positions from Lisbon's runway 21, and raised awareness of the incidents among pilots. “We are aware of the report and fully assisted the AAIB with its investigation,” says the budget carrier. ”The safety of our passengers and crew is always our highest priority. “We take events of this nature seriously and will always take action to ensure we maintain the highest standards of safety. As highlighted in the report we proactively took a number of safety actions.” It has also engaged with Airbus with regard to future potential protective measures. Although Airbus is developing a system for the A320 intended to offer protection against incorrectly-calculated take-off performance, it indicated to the inquiry that the system in its current state would not have warned the crews of either EasyJet aircraft because the runway remaining exceeded the forecast lift-off distance.",1,825,7.0,0.3614,"crew, runway, inquiry, land, approach, accident, investigator, captain, incident, pilot","['identical', 'serious', 'takeoff', 'incident', 'within', 'week', 'involve', 'easyjet', 'lisbon', 'spur', 'uk', 'investigator', 'advise', 'portugal', 'airport', 'operator', 'stop', 'use', 'confuse', 'terminology', 'runway', 'departure', 'position', 'incident', 'involve', 'accelerate', 'insufficient', 'thrust', 'become', 'airborne', 'close', 'far', 'end', 'runway', 'uk', 'accident', 'investigation', 'branch', 'say', 'bound', 'london', 'luton', 'april', 'intend', 'departure', 'intersection', 'lisbon', 'runway', 'state', 'reason', 'described', 'historic', 'aeronautical', 'information', 'publication', 'lisbon', 'refers', 'runway', 'takeoff', 'point', 'unlike', 'airport', 'elsewhere', 'calculate', 'takeoff', 'performance', 'criterion', 'electronic', 'flightbag', 'pilot', 'base', 'calculation', 'takeoff', 'position', 'designate', 'temporary', 'position', 'believe', 'refer', 'intersection', 'designation', 'actually', 'stood', 'intersection', 'use', 'fulllength', 'runway', 'takeoff', 'allow', 'low', 'thrust', 'level', 'crew', 'crosscheck', 'takeoff', 'distance', 'available', 'position', 'result', 'fail', 'detect', 'error', 'although', 'ultimately', 'depart', 'nearby', 'intersection', 'available', 'takeoff', 'distance', 'still', 'nearly', 'less', 'fulllength', 'runway', 'incorrect', 'performance', 'calculation', 'meant', 'thrust', 'low', 'departure', 'although', 'captain', 'mention', 'takeoff', 'roll', 'felt', 'wrong', 'say', 'inquiry', 'full', 'takeoff', 'thrust', 'select', 'flightdata', 'recorder', 'analysis', 'ground', 'roll', 'lift', 'runway', 'end', 'overfly', 'upwind', 'threshold', 'incident', 'involve', 'geztd', 'follow', 'day', 'later', 'identical', 'event', 'another', 'easyjet', 'oeijl', 'operating', 'paris', 'may', 'take', 'runway', 'end', 'cross', 'threshold', 'robust', 'adherence', 'procedure', 'key', 'defence', 'incident', 'occur', 'say', 'inquiry', 'point', 'pilot', 'often', 'find', 'reduce', 'acceleration', 'difficult', 'recognise', 'easyjet', 'since', 'take', 'step', 'prevent', 'recurrence', 'include', 'issue', 'notice', 'crew', 'clarify', 'takeoff', 'position', 'lisbon', 'runway', 'raise', 'awareness', 'incident', 'among', 'pilot', 'aware', 'report', 'fully', 'assist', 'aaib', 'investigation', 'say', 'budget', 'carrier', 'safety', 'passenger', 'crew', 'always', 'high', 'priority', 'take', 'event', 'nature', 'seriously', 'always', 'take', 'action', 'ensure', 'maintain', 'high', 'standard', 'safety', 'highlight', 'report', 'proactively', 'take', 'number', 'safety', 'engage', 'regard', 'future', 'potential', 'protective', 'measure', 'although', 'develop', 'system', 'intend', 'offer', 'protection', 'incorrectlycalculated', 'takeoff', 'performance', 'indicate', 'inquiry', 'system', 'current', 'state', 'warn', 'crew', 'either', 'easyjet', 'runway', 'remain', 'exceed', 'forecast', 'liftoff', 'distance']"
"The UK will be in breach of competition and state-aid laws unless it extends the exemption of air passenger duty it has promised Flybe to the wider industry, Ryanair's Michael O'Leary has argued. In a letter to UK chancellor Sajid Javid, the airline demands that should Flybe be granted an exemption from APD, this must also apply to Ryanair, EasyJet and British Airways. Ryanair blames Flybe's financial troubles on mismanagement and an unsustainable business model which has resulted in repeated crises at the regional carrier over the past two decades. Other airlines are able to operate UK domestic routes profitably, Ryanair asserts. O'Leary contends that “this government bailout of the billionaire-owned Flybe is in breach of both competition and state-aid laws”. Rejecting the suggestion from UK business secretary Andrea Leadsom that Flybe is a viable business, he writes: “The reason why Flybe isn't viable is because it cannot compete with lower-fare services from UK regional airports on domestic and EU routes provided by Ryanair, EasyJet, BA and others; and It cannot compete with lower-cost road and rail alternatives on many smaller UK domestic routes.” He continues “If Flybe fails...then Ryanair, EasyJet, BA and others will step in and provide lower-fare flights from the UK regional airports, as we already have to make up for the recent failure of Thomas Cook Airways.” The government has committed itself to providing Flybe with loan of around £100 million ($130 million) and/or a deferral of £106 million in APD, as well as a review of taxes on the UK domestic aviation sector. IAG has already filed a complaint to the European Union alleging that the rescue contravenes state-aid rules, while EasyJet has made the case that taxpayer cash should not be used to bail out individual companies. Campaigners have also argued that lowering APD will make it harder for the government to achieve its climate commitments, pointing out that many countries are increasing domestic aviation taxes to encourage more environmentally friendly forms of travel.",1,826,8.0,0.4728,"government, uk, carrier, business, state, share, south, airway, financial, plan","['uk', 'breach', 'competition', 'stateaid', 'law', 'unless', 'extends', 'exemption', 'passenger', 'duty', 'promise', 'flybe', 'wider', 'industry', 'ryanair', 'michael', 'argue', 'letter', 'uk', 'chancellor', 'sajid', 'javid', 'demand', 'flybe', 'grant', 'exemption', 'apd', 'must', 'apply', 'ryanair', 'easyjet', 'british', 'airway', 'ryanair', 'blame', 'flybe', 'financial', 'trouble', 'mismanagement', 'unsustainable', 'business', 'model', 'result', 'repeat', 'crisis', 'regional', 'carrier', 'past', 'decade', 'able', 'operate', 'uk', 'domestic', 'route', 'profitably', 'ryanair', 'asserts', 'contends', 'government', 'bailout', 'billionaireowned', 'flybe', 'breach', 'competition', 'stateaid', 'law', 'reject', 'suggestion', 'uk', 'business', 'secretary', 'andrea', 'leadsom', 'flybe', 'viable', 'business', 'writes', 'reason', 'flybe', 'viable', 'compete', 'lowerfare', 'service', 'uk', 'regional', 'airport', 'domestic', 'eu', 'route', 'provide', 'ryanair', 'easyjet', 'ba', 'others', 'compete', 'lowercost', 'road', 'rail', 'alternative', 'many', 'small', 'uk', 'domestic', 'continue', 'flybe', 'fails', 'ryanair', 'easyjet', 'ba', 'others', 'step', 'provide', 'lowerfare', 'uk', 'regional', 'airport', 'already', 'make', 'recent', 'failure', 'thomas', 'cook', 'government', 'commit', 'provide', 'flybe', 'loan', 'around', 'deferral', 'apd', 'well', 'review', 'tax', 'uk', 'domestic', 'sector', 'iag', 'already', 'file', 'complaint', 'european', 'union', 'allege', 'rescue', 'contravenes', 'stateaid', 'rule', 'easyjet', 'make', 'case', 'taxpayer', 'cash', 'use', 'bail', 'individual', 'campaigner', 'argue', 'lower', 'apd', 'make', 'harder', 'government', 'achieve', 'climate', 'commitment', 'point', 'many', 'country', 'increase', 'domestic', 'tax', 'encourage', 'environmentally', 'friendly', 'form', 'travel']"
"Stobart Group has committed up to £9 million ($12 million) in short-term funding for Flybe as part of the Connect Airways consortium's investment to keep the struggling UK regional carrier flying. Flybe's future has again been hanging in the balance as Connect Airways – which struck a deal to acquire the cash-strapped carrier a year ago – sought urgent talks with the UK Government. News of a deal emerged on 14 January when UK business secretary Andrea Leadsom said an agreement had been struck “to keep the company operating, ensuring that UK regions remain connected”. As part of that agreement, the government could defer millions of pounds owed by Flybe to cover its air passenger duty (APD) tax bill. The UK Treasury says that in the run-up to the March budget it will carry out a review of APD for all airlines “to ensure regional connectivity is strengthened while meeting the UK's climate change commitments to meet net zero by 2050”. Stobart Group, which holds a 30% stake in the Connect Airways consortium alongside Cyrus Capital (40%) and Virgin Atlantic (30%), has today in a stock market statement provided its first comment on the agreement. “The Connect Airways consortium has worked tirelessly alongside Flybe and the UK government to look for solutions to ensure the financial viability of the airline so that consumers can continue to have confidence in flying with Flybe,” Stobart says. Alongside the government’s review of air passenger duty and regional connectivity, it says the Connect Airways consortium has ”committed to providing Flybe further short-term funding with Stobart Group contributing up to £9 million of capital, with the funds drawn down only if required”. It notes the shareholder consortium has to date provided £110 million of funds to Connect Airways, and Stobart Group has invested £45 million through a combination of cash and the sale of Stobart Air, Stobart Group's regional airline, and its aircraft leasing business, Propius. While the consortium announced its intention to acquire the assets of Flybe in a cut-price deal last January, it did not receive European Commission clearance for the acquisition until July 2019. ”The delay in receiving control, coupled with a number of other factors including legacy issues, impacted on the delivery of the consortium's turnaround plan for Flybe,” Stobart says. ”This resulted in a situation in which a further injection of funds is required to ensure continued flying.”",1,827,8.0,0.5846,"government, uk, carrier, business, state, share, south, airway, financial, plan","['stobart', 'commit', 'shortterm', 'funding', 'flybe', 'part', 'connect', 'airway', 'consortium', 'investment', 'keep', 'struggle', 'uk', 'regional', 'carrier', 'fly', 'flybe', 'future', 'hang', 'balance', 'connect', 'airway', 'struck', 'deal', 'acquire', 'cashstrapped', 'carrier', 'ago', 'sought', 'urgent', 'talk', 'uk', 'government', 'news', 'deal', 'emerge', 'january', 'uk', 'business', 'secretary', 'andrea', 'leadsom', 'say', 'agreement', 'struck', 'keep', 'operating', 'ensure', 'uk', 'region', 'remain', 'connect', 'part', 'agreement', 'government', 'defer', 'pound', 'owe', 'flybe', 'cover', 'passenger', 'duty', 'apd', 'tax', 'bill', 'uk', 'treasury', 'say', 'runup', 'march', 'budget', 'carry', 'review', 'apd', 'ensure', 'regional', 'connectivity', 'strengthen', 'meeting', 'uk', 'climate', 'change', 'commitment', 'meet', 'net', 'zero', 'stobart', 'hold', 'stake', 'connect', 'airway', 'consortium', 'alongside', 'cyrus', 'capital', 'virgin', 'atlantic', 'today', 'stock', 'market', 'statement', 'provide', 'comment', 'agreement', 'connect', 'airway', 'consortium', 'work', 'tirelessly', 'alongside', 'flybe', 'uk', 'government', 'look', 'solution', 'ensure', 'financial', 'viability', 'consumer', 'continue', 'confidence', 'fly', 'flybe', 'stobart', 'say', 'alongside', 'government', 'review', 'passenger', 'duty', 'regional', 'connectivity', 'say', 'connect', 'airway', 'consortium', 'commit', 'provide', 'flybe', 'far', 'shortterm', 'funding', 'stobart', 'contribute', 'capital', 'fund', 'drawn', 'require', 'note', 'shareholder', 'consortium', 'date', 'provide', 'fund', 'connect', 'airway', 'stobart', 'invest', 'combination', 'cash', 'sale', 'stobart', 'stobart', 'regional', 'lease', 'business', 'propius', 'consortium', 'announce', 'intention', 'acquire', 'asset', 'flybe', 'cutprice', 'deal', 'january', 'receive', 'european', 'commission', 'clearance', 'acquisition', 'july', 'delay', 'receive', 'control', 'couple', 'number', 'factor', 'include', 'legacy', 'issue', 'impact', 'delivery', 'consortium', 'turnaround', 'plan', 'flybe', 'stobart', 'say', 'result', 'situation', 'far', 'injection', 'fund', 'require', 'ensure', 'continued', 'fly']"
"British Airways has included domestic routes in a ticket sale launched two days after the UK government disclosed a rescue deal for regional carrier Flybe. The BA promotion spans flights between London and multiple UK destinations: Aberdeen, Belfast City, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Inverness, Leeds, Manchester, Newcastle and Jersey. All of these airports are served by Flybe, Cirium schedules data shows. The Exeter-based carrier operates direct flights to London from Aberdeen, Belfast City, Edinburgh, Exeter and Newquay. On 14 January, UK business secretary Andrea Leadsom confirmed that an agreement had been reached with Flybe “to keep the company operating, ensuring that UK regions remain connected”. As part of that agreement, the government could defer millions of pounds owed by Flybe to cover its air passenger duty (APD) tax bill. Willie Walsh, chief executive of BA parent IAG, has criticised the rescue package as “a blatant misuse of public funds”. He argues that Flybe's shareholders – which include BA rival Virgin Atlantic, itself part-owned by Delta Air Lines– “now want the taxpayer to pick up the tab for their mismanagement of the airline”. The government's support for Flybe also came under fire from environmental groups, which argue that tax cuts on air travel would be contradictory to efforts to reduce emissions.

"Kuwait Airways' latest full-year financial figures show the airline's losses worsened to KD131.9 million ($435 million), the equivalent of over $17 million in losses for every aircraft in its fleet. Its revenues for the year to 31 December 2018 rose by 10% to KD344 million. While it slashed overall employee costs by 11% the airline was burdened by a sharp rise in its fuel expenditure, up by more than one-third for the year. Kuwait Airways also had to absorb a doubling of maintenance costs. Its operating loss for the year soared by 40%, amounting to KD120 million, while the net loss was up 25% to KD131.9 million. Kuwait Airways acknowledges that – at the end of 2018 – its accumulated losses amounted to KD416 million, and that its liabilities exceeded its assets by KD208 million. But its management “does not consider” that this equates to a material uncertainty regarding the company's ability to continue as a going concern. It points out that it received KD300 million additional capital from its shareholder on 3 July last year, to finance fleet-expansion plans. “The company's long-term financial plan envisages an increase in aircraft fleet, increased flight services to profitable sectors and cost optimisation with an aim to improve revenue and operational profits,” it adds in its full-year statement. Kuwait Airways says it was operating 25 aircraft in 2018, of which 17 were on operating lease. Its fleet currently comprises 27 jets, according to Cirium data, including 10 Boeing 777-300ERs, five Airbus A330-200s, and 12 Airbus single-aisle aircraft of which two are A320neos.",1,829,3.0,0.2613,"passenger, loss, operating, revenue, traffic, month, increase, capacity, decline, result","['kuwait', 'airway', 'late', 'fullyear', 'financial', 'figure', 'loss', 'worsen', 'equivalent', 'loss', 'every', 'fleet', 'revenue', 'december', 'rise', 'slash', 'overall', 'employee', 'cost', 'burden', 'sharp', 'rise', 'fuel', 'expenditure', 'onethird', 'kuwait', 'airway', 'absorb', 'double', 'maintenance', 'cost', 'operating', 'loss', 'soar', 'amount', 'net', 'loss', 'kuwait', 'airway', 'acknowledges', 'end', 'accumulate', 'loss', 'amount', 'liability', 'exceed', 'asset', 'management', 'consider', 'equates', 'material', 'uncertainty', 'regard', 'ability', 'continue', 'go', 'concern', 'point', 'receive', 'additional', 'capital', 'shareholder', 'july', 'finance', 'fleetexpansion', 'plan', 'longterm', 'financial', 'plan', 'envisages', 'increase', 'fleet', 'increase', 'service', 'profitable', 'sector', 'cost', 'optimisation', 'aim', 'improve', 'revenue', 'operational', 'profit', 'add', 'fullyear', 'statement', 'kuwait', 'airway', 'say', 'operating', 'operating', 'lease', 'fleet', 'currently', 'comprises', 'jet', 'accord', 'data', 'include', 'singleaisle']"
"Airbus deliveries for the final month of last year indicate that the airframer has yet to restore the smooth production rates it achieved in the first half of the decade. While December has typically been relatively busy in terms of Airbus output, it managed to keep the proportion of deliveries for the month to around 10-14% from 2010-15. But technical snags and industrial problems which emerged as the manufacturer embarked on its transition to the A320neo family in 2016 have tended to force a backloading of deliveries. It has recently been striving to overcome production complexities relating to the A321neo.  Industrial problems with A321neo production have hampered Airbus Airbus handed over 16% of its 863 deliveries for 2019 during December, a figure which rises slightly to 16.1% when discounting the effect of A220 production. This is above the figure of 15.3% – again adjusted for the A220 – from 2018, revealing that the backloading proportion actually increased rather than fell. Not only was the proportion higher, but the increase in production rates meant that it equated to a greater number of aircraft in 2019 than the same proportion would have covered in 2018. The December 2019 delivery level is below the 17.7% of December 2017 but similar to that of December 2016, showing that Airbus – for the fourth year running – has been forced to deal with an intense end-of-year rush. Airbus delivered 138 aircraft in December 2019 including seven from the A220 line. Its annual numbers contest with Boeing, however, was effectively no contest as its US rival remained affected by the fallout from the 737 Max grounding.

"Delta Air Lines says that one of its Boeing 777-200 aircraft dumped fuel over Los Angeles as it was returning to the Los Angeles international airport (LAX) after declaring an emergency, slightly injuring 17 children and nine adults who were outdoors on a school playground. “Shortly after takeoff, Flight 89 from LAX to Shanghai experienced an engine issue requiring the aircraft to declare an emergency and return to LAX,” the Atlanta-based carrier says on 14 January. “The aircraft landed safely after an emergency fuel release, which was required to reach a safe landing weight.” The airline did not say what kind of “engine issue” the aircraft had experienced. It had 149 people on board. “We are in touch with Los Angeles World Airports and the LA County Fire Department, and share concerns regarding reported minor injuries to adults and children at a school in the area,” the airline says. More than 70 firefighters and paramedics responded to the hazmat incident, and the Los Angeles County Fire Department confirmed in a tweet that the liquid which fell onto the children in their school playground was indeed jet fuel. Victims complained about skin irritation and a noxious smell, but none of the affected individuals were transported to hospitals. The Federal Aviation Administration says that it is investigating the incident. ”There are special fuel-dumping procedures for aircraft operating into and out of any major US airport,” the regulatory body says in a statement. ”These procedures call for fuel to be dumped over designated unpopulated areas, typically at higher altitudes so the fuel atomizes and disperses before it reaches the ground.” According to FlightAware flight tracking, flight DL89 reached a maximum altitude of 7,800ft before it returned to LAX where it landed safely.",1,831,10.0,0.1676,"international, authority, civil, state, investigation, case, add, january, airasia, crash","['delta', 'line', 'say', 'dumped', 'fuel', 'los', 'angeles', 'return', 'los', 'angeles', 'international', 'airport', 'lax', 'declare', 'emergency', 'slightly', 'injure', 'child', 'adult', 'outdoors', 'school', 'playground', 'shortly', 'takeoff', 'lax', 'shanghai', 'experienced', 'engine', 'issue', 'require', 'declare', 'emergency', 'return', 'lax', 'atlantabased', 'carrier', 'say', 'january', 'land', 'safely', 'emergency', 'fuel', 'release', 'require', 'reach', 'safe', 'land', 'say', 'kind', 'engine', 'issue', 'experienced', 'people', 'board', 'touch', 'los', 'angeles', 'world', 'airport', 'la', 'county', 'fire', 'department', 'share', 'concern', 'regard', 'report', 'minor', 'injury', 'adult', 'child', 'school', 'area', 'say', 'firefighter', 'paramedic', 'respond', 'hazmat', 'incident', 'los', 'angeles', 'county', 'fire', 'department', 'confirm', 'tweet', 'liquid', 'fell', 'onto', 'child', 'school', 'playground', 'indeed', 'jet', 'fuel', 'victim', 'complain', 'skin', 'irritation', 'noxious', 'smell', 'none', 'affected', 'individual', 'transport', 'hospital', 'federal', 'administration', 'say', 'investigate', 'incident', 'special', 'fueldumping', 'procedure', 'operating', 'major', 'u', 'airport', 'regulatory', 'body', 'say', 'statement', 'procedure', 'call', 'fuel', 'dumped', 'designate', 'unpopulated', 'area', 'typically', 'high', 'altitude', 'fuel', 'atomizes', 'disperses', 'reach', 'accord', 'flightaware', 'track', 'reach', 'maximum', 'altitude', 'return', 'lax', 'land', 'safely']"
"The full impact of the 737 Max grounding on Boeing's 2019 orders and deliveries came to light on 14 January when the company released final 2019 figures. Boeing's numbers show that, owing to cancellations and conversions, it ended the year with fewer commercial aircraft in its backlog than at the start. Its 2019 commercial aircraft deliveries also slid more than half, year-over-year, to 380 aircraft, data released by Boeing on 14 January shows.  Regulators grounded the 737 Max in March 2019. Boeing will release full-year financial results on 29 January, at which point the Max grounding's impact on Boeing's bottom line will become clearer. US Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin said on 12 January that Boeing's woes will likely depress total US GDP growth in 2020 by 0.5 percentage points, from 3% to 2.5%. “There is no question that the Boeing situation is going to slow down the GDP numbers. Boeing is one of the largest exports,” Mnuchin told Fox News. “With the 737 Max, I think that could impact GDP as much as 50 basis points this year.” At the end of 2019, Boeing's commercial aircraft backlog stood at 5,406 aircraft, down 38 aircraft from 5,444 at the start of the year. During the 12 months, Boeing received new orders for 246 aircraft. But cancellations and order conversations left Boeing's net 2019 orders at negative 87, according to the company. The December order figures, also show the same trend. Boeing landed new orders for three commercial aircraft in December but it received five cancellations, bringing the month's net orders to negative two. New December orders included those from identified customers for one 787-8 and one 787-9, while customers cancelled orders for three 787-9s and one 787-8. A customer also swapped a 737 Max delivery position, which, in Boeing's books, counts once to both the order and the cancellation tallies. Boeing's minus 87 net orders for 2019 compares with a whopping 893 new aircraft orders it received in 2018, and 912 received in 2017. Boeing delivered 380 aircraft last year, down 53% from 806 deliveries in 2018, figures show. Its deliveries included 127 737s, seven 747s, 43 767s, 45 777s and 158 787s, Boeing says.

"The British government is considering a removal of air passenger duty on domestic flights in a bid to help regional carrier Flybe, the BBC reports. Chancellor Sajid Javid is holding today emergency talks with officials from the departments of transport and business about the airline's future. In a televised interview earlier today, prime minister Boris Johnson said: “We're working very hard to do what we can, but obviously people will understand that there are limits, commercially, to what a government can do to rescue any particular firm.” “But what we will do is ensure that we have the regional connectivity that this country needs,” he says. Such a deal would allow the airline to defer around £100 million ($130 million) in tax payments until 2023 and would be subject to Flybe's three main shareholders –Virgin Atlantic, Stobart Air and fund management company Cyrus Capital – providing further investment into the airline. A treasury spokesman refused to comment. Flybe is the sole operator on multiple domestic routes and plays a key role in ensuring connectivity between several regions of the UK. Any decision to cut passenger duty would be a step in the opposite direction from action that several countries are taking to curb domestic air travel on environmental grounds. From April, Germany will levy higher taxes on domestic air flights and reduce taxes on train tickets. Sweden enacted aviation taxes on domestic travel in 2018, while the Dutch government is also set to increase aviation taxes. Doug Parr, Greenpeace's UK chief scientist said on Twitter that if the government does reduce air passenger duty, it would leave “little hope for UK decarbonisation efforts”.",1,833,8.0,0.2747,"government, uk, carrier, business, state, share, south, airway, financial, plan","['british', 'government', 'consider', 'removal', 'passenger', 'duty', 'domestic', 'bid', 'help', 'regional', 'carrier', 'flybe', 'bbc', 'report', 'chancellor', 'sajid', 'javid', 'hold', 'today', 'emergency', 'talk', 'official', 'department', 'transport', 'business', 'future', 'televise', 'interview', 'earlier', 'today', 'prime', 'minister', 'boris', 'johnson', 'say', 'work', 'hard', 'obviously', 'people', 'understand', 'limit', 'commercially', 'government', 'rescue', 'particular', 'ensure', 'regional', 'connectivity', 'country', 'need', 'say', 'deal', 'allow', 'defer', 'around', 'tax', 'payment', 'subject', 'flybe', 'main', 'shareholder', 'atlantic', 'stobart', 'fund', 'management', 'cyrus', 'capital', 'provide', 'far', 'investment', 'treasury', 'spokesman', 'refuse', 'comment', 'flybe', 'sole', 'operator', 'multiple', 'domestic', 'route', 'play', 'key', 'role', 'ensure', 'connectivity', 'several', 'region', 'uk', 'decision', 'cut', 'passenger', 'duty', 'step', 'opposite', 'direction', 'action', 'several', 'country', 'take', 'curb', 'domestic', 'travel', 'environmental', 'ground', 'april', 'germany', 'levy', 'high', 'tax', 'domestic', 'reduce', 'tax', 'train', 'ticket', 'sweden', 'enact', 'tax', 'domestic', 'travel', 'dutch', 'government', 'set', 'increase', 'tax', 'doug', 'parr', 'greenpeace', 'uk', 'chief', 'scientist', 'say', 'twitter', 'government', 'reduce', 'passenger', 'duty', 'leave', 'little', 'hope', 'uk', 'decarbonisation', 'effort']"
"Investigators have commenced detailed mathematical modelling of a crashed Bek Air Fokker 100's flightpath, after icing was identified as a leading suspect in the fatal accident. Preliminary findings from the accident inquiry, disclosed at a formal Kazakh government briefing, have found that the aircraft had been “partially treated” with the de-icing fluid, with only the horizontal stabiliser covered. “The wings were not processed,” it states. “The commission has not ruled out the possibility of ice on the surfaces of the aircraft, which was parked for about two days.” Russia's Interstate Aviation Committee says it has obtained a “priority version” of the cause of the accident, after preliminary analysis of the information downloaded from the flight-data and cockpit-voice recorders from the jet. The commission says aircraft's tail struck the ground six times during its attempt to lift off from Almaty during a flight to Nur-Sultan on 27 December, and the aircraft also experienced a single wing strike. The Fokker's landing-gear contacted the ground four times, it adds, and 38 runway lights were damaged during the accident. Surveillance video indicates de-icing of the Fokker 100's stabiliser (background) In order to establish the aerodynamic characteristics of the aircraft during take-off, says the Interstate Aviation Committee, an international investigation team has embarked on efforts to model the flight. This will take into account “the influence of external factors, primarily ground icing”, it adds. The study will analyse the aircraft's motion and the actions of the crew. Dutch investigators have been given a copy of the flight-data recording, says the committee, and are co-operating with the modelling work along with representatives from Kazakhstan and the European Union Aviation Safety Agency. The Netherlands is supporting the work as the state of Fokker manufacture. Investigators have pursued other lines of inquiry but have found no evidence of incorrect loading or balance. But several subcommittees have been set up to examine various aspects of the accident, and a laboratory study is under way to establish whether de-icing fluid met the required criteria.

"A former Martinair executive has been extradited to the US to face charges related to cargo price fixing after ten years on the run. Maria Ullings, a Dutch national, was originally indicted in 2010 by the US District Court in Atlanta for allegedly participating in a global conspiracy to fix air cargo prices, says the US Department of Justice (DOJ). Ullings formerly served as senior vice president with the company. “A fugitive for almost 10 years, Ullings was apprehended by Italian authorities in July 2019 while visiting Sicily,” says the department. “Ullings initially contested extradition in the Italian courts, but after the Court of Appeals of Palermo ruled that she be extradited, she waived her appeal.” The indictment states that Ullings “conspired with others to suppress and eliminate competition by fixing and coordinating certain surcharges, including fuel surcharges, charged to customers located in the United States and elsewhere for air cargo shipments.” The allegations state that she conspired in price fixing from January 2001 to February 2006. It adds that 22 airlines and 21 executives have been charged under the long running case against cargo price fixing in the airline industry, generating $1.8 billion in fines and resulting in seven executives serving prison time. In June 2008 the DOJ revealed that Air France-KLM, Cathay Pacific, SAS Cargo, and Martinair had participated in a cargo transportation price-fixing cartel that spanned several years. The carriers were fined a collective $504 million after pleading guilty. They had been accused of participating in meetings to discuss cargo rates on transatlantic shipments, agreeing to set charges at certain levels, and checking one another's rates to ensure adherence to the agreed prices. Other carriers were also caught up in the long running case, in some cases paying substantial fines.",1,835,10.0,0.3291,"international, authority, civil, state, investigation, case, add, january, airasia, crash","['former', 'martinair', 'executive', 'extradite', 'u', 'face', 'charge', 'related', 'cargo', 'price', 'fix', 'run', 'maria', 'ullings', 'dutch', 'national', 'originally', 'indict', 'u', 'district', 'court', 'atlanta', 'allegedly', 'participate', 'global', 'conspiracy', 'fix', 'cargo', 'price', 'say', 'u', 'department', 'justice', 'doj', 'ullings', 'formerly', 'serve', 'senior', 'vice', 'president', 'fugitive', 'almost', 'ullings', 'apprehend', 'italian', 'authority', 'july', 'visit', 'sicily', 'say', 'department', 'ullings', 'initially', 'contest', 'extradition', 'italian', 'court', 'court', 'appeal', 'palermo', 'rule', 'extradite', 'waive', 'indictment', 'state', 'ullings', 'conspire', 'others', 'suppress', 'eliminate', 'competition', 'fix', 'coordinate', 'certain', 'surcharge', 'include', 'fuel', 'surcharge', 'charge', 'customer', 'locate', 'united', 'state', 'elsewhere', 'cargo', 'allegation', 'state', 'conspire', 'price', 'fix', 'january', 'february', 'add', 'executive', 'charge', 'long', 'run', 'case', 'cargo', 'price', 'fix', 'industry', 'generate', 'fine', 'result', 'executive', 'serve', 'prison', 'june', 'doj', 'reveal', 'franceklm', 'cathay', 'pacific', 'sa', 'cargo', 'martinair', 'participate', 'cargo', 'transportation', 'pricefixing', 'cartel', 'span', 'several', 'carrier', 'fin', 'collective', 'plead', 'guilty', 'accuse', 'participate', 'meeting', 'discus', 'cargo', 'rate', 'transatlantic', 'shipment', 'agree', 'set', 'charge', 'certain', 'level', 'check', 'another', 'rate', 'ensure', 'adherence', 'agree', 'price', 'carrier', 'caught', 'long', 'run', 'case', 'case', 'pay', 'substantial', 'fine']"

"GE Aviation is laying off 70 temporary workers from its site in Bromont, Quebec, citing Boeing's decision to halt 737 Max production as one factor leading to the cuts. The Ohio-based engine maker confirms it has “informed 70 temporary workers of a temporary layoff” at the Bromont facility, which is about 80km (43nm) east of Montreal. Those workers account for 13% of GE Aviation production workers at Bromont, where the company performs engineering, robotics and production work for several engines, including CFM International Leap turbofans. The Bromont site employs some 900 people. CFM Leap 1-Bs power the 737 Max. GE Aviation, which owns CFM International in partnership with Safran Aircraft Engines, confirms that the layoffs stem at least partly from the 737 Max production halt, set to take effect imminently. The job cuts, reported by Quebec media outlet la Voix de l'Est, reflect variations in component output, it adds. GE Aviation has no additional “large scale” layoffs planned but cannot rule out small staff adjustments at some sites, it says. GE Aviation has also responded to the Max issues by transferring employees from Leap assignments to those involving other engine programmes and to parts manufacturing roles in its growing aviation services business. The company may also reduce its use of temporary workers and contractors, and cut back on employee overtime, it says. “A key priority is protecting our ability to ramp production back up”, GE Aviation says. Boeing intends to temporarily suspend 737 Max production in the middle of this month due to uncertainty about when regulators will lift the aircraft's grounding. Last week, top 737 supplier Spirit AeroSystems disclosed it is laying off 2,800 employees in response to the Max issues, with more layoffs possible. Boeing has not yet laid off employees but is transferring Max workers to other programmes, it has said.

"UK pilots are alarmed and dismayed over indications that regional operator Flybe is holding urgent discussions over funding. The airline has so far refused to disclose details of the situation, or even confirm any reports, stating that it does not comment on “rumour or speculation”. But UK pilot union BALPA's leader, general secretary Brian Strutton, says he is “appalled” that the future of the airline is “being discussed in secret”, excluding its employees and their representatives. UK broadcaster Sky News first reported on 12 January that the airline was holding funding discussions, including exploratory talks with the government, with accountancy firm EY on standby to handle any filing for administration. Flybe had previously faced collapse when it negotiated an acquisition by a consortium called Connect Airways, established by Virgin Atlantic, Stobart Group and financial firm Cyrus Capital. The regional airline's shareholders accepted the takeover agreement in February last year, after the company laid out that the alternative was a winding-up process. Under the takeover plan Flybe is to be rebranded as Virgin Connect. But the company has yet to clarify the airline's situation, while BALPA is demanding “immediate talks” on the carrier's future. “This is an appalling state of affairs and we demand that the owners of Flybe [and] the government departments involved stop hiding and talk to us about Flybe,” insists Strutton. “We have a right to be consulted and the staff have a right to know what is going on.”",1,840,8.0,0.394,"government, uk, carrier, business, state, share, south, airway, financial, plan","['uk', 'pilot', 'alarmed', 'dismayed', 'indication', 'regional', 'operator', 'flybe', 'hold', 'urgent', 'discussion', 'funding', 'far', 'refuse', 'disclose', 'detail', 'situation', 'even', 'confirm', 'report', 'state', 'comment', 'rumour', 'speculation', 'uk', 'pilot', 'union', 'balpa', 'leader', 'general', 'secretary', 'brian', 'strutton', 'say', 'appalled', 'future', 'discuss', 'secret', 'exclude', 'employee', 'representative', 'uk', 'broadcaster', 'sky', 'news', 'report', 'january', 'hold', 'funding', 'discussion', 'include', 'exploratory', 'talk', 'government', 'accountancy', 'firm', 'ey', 'standby', 'handle', 'filing', 'administration', 'flybe', 'previously', 'face', 'collapse', 'negotiate', 'acquisition', 'consortium', 'call', 'connect', 'airway', 'establish', 'virgin', 'atlantic', 'stobart', 'financial', 'firm', 'cyrus', 'capital', 'regional', 'shareholder', 'accepted', 'takeover', 'agreement', 'february', 'laid', 'alternative', 'windingup', 'process', 'takeover', 'plan', 'flybe', 'rebranded', 'virgin', 'connect', 'yet', 'clarify', 'situation', 'balpa', 'demand', 'immediate', 'talk', 'carrier', 'future', 'appal', 'state', 'affair', 'demand', 'owner', 'flybe', 'government', 'department', 'involve', 'stop', 'hiding', 'talk', 'u', 'flybe', 'insists', 'strutton', 'right', 'consult', 'staff', 'right', 'know', 'go']"
"Images showing the damaged forward fuselage and windshield of the crashed Ukraine International Airlines Boeing 737-800 have been released through Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky's office. While the aircraft has been severely damaged by the ground impact, the images also show evidence of penetration damage – with puncture holes in the order of 10mm diameter – consistent with high-energy fragmentation from an explosion, although the section of the airframe shown has not been specified. Iranian authorities have already admitted that the 737 was brought down by an inadvertent missile strike. The images give little information as to the primary detonation point relative to the airframe. Dutch aerospace laboratory NLR's analysis of damage to the Boeing 777-200ER shot down over Ukraine found warhead fragmentation punctures of 6-14mm, and typically around 11mm.

"Ukrainian investigators will conduct the technical work on the cockpit-voice and flight-data recorders retrieved from the Boeing 737-800 which crashed in Tehran. This work will be shadowed by specialists from the French investigation authority BEA, following discussions between Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky and his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron. BEA had previously denied that it had been asked to provide assistance with the recorders' information extraction, but has since confirmed it will “attend” the work “which will be done in Ukraine”. It stresses that the Iranian accident investigation agency remains in charge of the probe into the 8 January crash involving Ukraine International Airlines flight PS752. Zelensky had earlier held a conversation with Macron during which the two sides had agreed on the “involvement” of French specialists in the “deciphering” of the recorder information, the Ukrainian president's office states. Macron has pledged to support a comprehensive investigation into the crash and prosecution of those responsible. Zelensky's office adds that France has commenced a formal procedure to open an international investigation through ICAO. He says a team of Ukrainian investigators dispatched to Tehran in the aftermath of the crash have worked “selflessly, diligently, and around the clock” and that their efforts have helped the truth of the situation to surface. Work is being carried out to reconstruct the aircraft, he adds. Zelensky says that discussions with Iranian president Hassan Rouhani have resulted in agreements not only regarding analysis of the flight recorders but also on legal and technical co-operation. He adds that the state will “make every effort” to obtain compensation from the carrier, insurance firms, and the Iranian government.

"Iranian president Hassan Rouhani's statement of admission that the country's defence forces shot down the Ukraine International Airlines Boeing 737-800 in Tehran, lacing humility with an air of political justification, will doubtless be compared and contrasted with the US response to the accidental destruction of an Iran Air flight in 1988. Rouhani calls the loss of the Ukrainian aircraft a “disastrous mistake” after being informed of the outcome of an Iranian armed forces' investigation into the 8 January crash. But he also couches the statement with justification, pointing out that the incident took place in an “atmosphere of threats and intimidation” by an “aggressive American regime”, with its armed forces on “full alert” to protect against a possible US military offensive. “[This] unfortunately led to this terrible catastrophe taking the lives of dozens of innocent people because of human error and mistaken shooting,” says Rouhani. His statement is designed to offload some of the responsibility onto the US administration, and has parallels with US president Ronald Reagan's response to the US Navy's inadvertent missile attack on Iran Air flight IR655 in July 1988, an event which remains one of the most contentious in two sides' fractious relationship. The Airbus A300 was brought down in the Persian Gulf by the US warship USS Vincennes, whose crew – at a time of heightened tension and US-Iranian military skirmishes – had mistaken the aircraft for an inbound Iranian Grumman F-14. Reagan stated, on the day the of attack, that the Vincennes had appeared to be undertaking a “proper defensive action” when he acknowledged that the Iranian airliner had been shot down over the Strait of Hormuz. “This is a terrible human tragedy. Our sympathy and condolences go out to the passengers, crew and their families,” he said, promising a full investigation. “We deeply regret any loss of life.” But Reagan continued with the justification angle. “The course of the Iranian civilian airliner was such that it was headed directly for the USS Vincennes, which was at the time engaged with five Iranian Boghammer boats that had attacked our forces,” he said. “When the aircraft failed to heed repeated warnings, the Vincennes followed standing orders and widely-publicised procedures, firing to protect itself against possible attack.” With the 8 January incident involving a Ukrainian flight, and Iranian passengers, the situation – while dire in its own right – is arguably less politically sensitive than it might have been if the Tehran attack had involved a US aircraft. Having opened with defensive remarks condemning the US stance, Rouhani continues with considerable contriteness and even an initial apology for the situation. “The Islamic Republic of Iran is deeply sorry by this disastrous mistake,” he says. “I extend my deepest condolences to the families of the victims of this tragic incident on behalf of the Islamic Republic of Iran, and instruct all related organs to take all necessary measures to compensate and sympathise with the bereaved families.” Rouhani says the accident is “not something that can be easily overlooked”, adding that further investigation is necessary to identify its cause – and he also refers to prosecution of the “perpetrators of this unforgivable mistake” and the adoption of measures to address “weaknesses of the country's defence systems” to prevent a repetition. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky is insisting on an “official apology” from Iran, through diplomatic channels, for the incident, as well as a transparent investigation, repatriation of the victims, and compensation for the loss. “Iran has pleaded guilty to [destroying] the Ukrainian aircraft,” he says. “But we insist on full admission of guilt.”",1,843,10.0,0.4472,"international, authority, civil, state, investigation, case, add, january, airasia, crash","['iranian', 'president', 'hassan', 'rouhani', 'statement', 'admission', 'country', 'defence', 'force', 'shot', 'ukraine', 'international', 'tehran', 'lace', 'humility', 'political', 'justification', 'doubtless', 'compare', 'contrast', 'u', 'response', 'accidental', 'destruction', 'iran', 'rouhani', 'call', 'loss', 'ukrainian', 'disastrous', 'mistake', 'inform', 'outcome', 'iranian', 'arm', 'force', 'investigation', 'january', 'crash', 'couch', 'statement', 'justification', 'point', 'incident', 'take', 'place', 'atmosphere', 'threat', 'intimidation', 'aggressive', 'american', 'regime', 'arm', 'force', 'full', 'alert', 'protect', 'possible', 'u', 'military', 'offensive', 'unfortunately', 'lead', 'terrible', 'catastrophe', 'take', 'life', 'dozen', 'innocent', 'people', 'human', 'error', 'mistaken', 'shoot', 'say', 'rouhani', 'statement', 'design', 'offload', 'responsibility', 'onto', 'u', 'administration', 'parallel', 'u', 'president', 'ronald', 'reagan', 'response', 'u', 'navy', 'inadvertent', 'missile', 'attack', 'iran', 'july', 'event', 'remains', 'contentious', 'side', 'fractious', 'relationship', 'brought', 'persian', 'gulf', 'u', 'warship', 'vincennes', 'whose', 'crew', 'heighten', 'tension', 'usiranian', 'military', 'skirmish', 'mistaken', 'inbound', 'iranian', 'grumman', 'reagan', 'state', 'day', 'attack', 'vincennes', 'appear', 'undertaking', 'proper', 'defensive', 'action', 'acknowledge', 'iranian', 'airliner', 'shot', 'strait', 'hormuz', 'terrible', 'human', 'tragedy', 'sympathy', 'condolence', 'go', 'passenger', 'crew', 'family', 'say', 'promising', 'full', 'investigation', 'deeply', 'regret', 'loss', 'reagan', 'continued', 'justification', 'angle', 'course', 'iranian', 'civilian', 'airliner', 'head', 'directly', 'vincennes', 'engage', 'iranian', 'boghammer', 'boat', 'attack', 'force', 'say', 'fail', 'heed', 'repeat', 'warning', 'vincennes', 'follow', 'stand', 'order', 'widelypublicised', 'procedure', 'fire', 'protect', 'possible', 'january', 'incident', 'involve', 'ukrainian', 'iranian', 'passenger', 'situation', 'dire', 'right', 'arguably', 'less', 'politically', 'sensitive', 'might', 'tehran', 'attack', 'involve', 'u', 'open', 'defensive', 'remark', 'condemn', 'u', 'stance', 'rouhani', 'continue', 'considerable', 'contriteness', 'even', 'initial', 'apology', 'situation', 'islamic', 'republic', 'iran', 'deeply', 'sorry', 'disastrous', 'mistake', 'say', 'extend', 'deepest', 'condolence', 'family', 'victim', 'tragic', 'incident', 'behalf', 'islamic', 'republic', 'iran', 'instruct', 'related', 'organ', 'take', 'necessary', 'measure', 'compensate', 'sympathise', 'bereave', 'rouhani', 'say', 'accident', 'something', 'easily', 'overlook', 'add', 'far', 'investigation', 'necessary', 'identify', 'cause', 'refers', 'prosecution', 'perpetrator', 'unforgivable', 'mistake', 'adoption', 'measure', 'address', 'weakness', 'country', 'defence', 'system', 'prevent', 'repetition', 'ukrainian', 'president', 'volodymyr', 'zelensky', 'insist', 'official', 'apology', 'iran', 'diplomatic', 'channel', 'incident', 'well', 'transparent', 'investigation', 'repatriation', 'victim', 'compensation', 'loss', 'iran', 'plead', 'guilty', 'destroy', 'ukrainian', 'say', 'insist', 'full', 'admission', 'guilt']"
"In a surprise move, the Iranian armed forces says it accidentally shot down a Boeing 737-800 flown by Ukraine International Airlines on 8 January. The admission comes after several days of repeated denials from Tehran that it had anything to do with the loss of flight PS752, an incident that killed 176 people. The nation now says that the aircraft was shot down by a missile battery manned by jumpy soldiers nervous about possible American air strikes. Iran was expecting air strikes in retaliation for a ballistic missile strike it launched hours earlier against US soldiers in Iraq. Its ballistic missile launch was itself retaliation for the USA's assassination of Iranian Major General Qasem Soleimani. Soleimani was killed by a US drone strike partly in retaliation for orchestrating attacks on the US embassy in Bagdad. “Following the threats of the [US] President and the commanders [of the] military American criminal mob, in the hours after the missile strikes US terrorist forces' warplanes around the country increased, and some reports of airstrikes targeting strategic centres in the country were reported to numerous defence units and targets on some radar plates,” the Iranian armed forces say in a media release posted to the country's state-run Islamic Republic News Agency. “It has caused more sensitivity in air defence units.” The Iranian armed forces claim that after the Boeing 737 left Tehran Imam Khomeini International Airport it began to fly a rotation that put it in “close proximity to a sensitive military centre of the [Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps].” The aircraft was “the height and shape of a hostile aircraft,” says the Iranian military. “In these circumstances, the plane was accidentally hit by a human error, which unfortunately results in the martyrdom of dear compatriots and the death of a number of foreign nationals,” it says. The admission of fault comes after several days of denials and insistence the aircraft had suffered unspecified mechanical problems. Tehran had said the missile attack allegation was “scientifically impossible”. However, circumstances surrounding the downing of the airliner were highly suspicious. After taking off, the Boeing 737 climbed to 8,000ft, but then quickly lost altitude and crashed into the ground while on fire. Pilots made no distress calls from the cockpit. Also, video on social media quickly surfaced of a missile flying through the night sky and striking an airliner in the area of the crash. As those pieces of information began to emerge many expert observers began to suspect exactly what Iran is admitting now: an ill-trained missile unit under high stress, and poorly coordinated with civilian aviation authorities, mistakenly shot down flight PS752. Experts believe the aircraft was shot down by a Russian-made short-range Tor-M1 surface-to-air missile battery. Iran pledges to carry “out major reforms in [the] operational processes” of its armed forces “make such errors impossible” in the future. The country offered “condolences” and “apologises for the human error.”",1,844,10.0,0.3351,"international, authority, civil, state, investigation, case, add, january, airasia, crash","['surprise', 'move', 'iranian', 'arm', 'force', 'say', 'accidentally', 'shot', 'flown', 'ukraine', 'international', 'january', 'admission', 'come', 'several', 'day', 'repeat', 'denial', 'tehran', 'anything', 'loss', 'incident', 'kill', 'people', 'nation', 'say', 'shot', 'missile', 'battery', 'man', 'jumpy', 'soldier', 'nervous', 'possible', 'american', 'strike', 'iran', 'expect', 'strike', 'retaliation', 'ballistic', 'missile', 'strike', 'launch', 'hour', 'earlier', 'u', 'soldier', 'iraq', 'ballistic', 'missile', 'launch', 'retaliation', 'usa', 'assassination', 'iranian', 'major', 'general', 'qasem', 'soleimani', 'soleimani', 'kill', 'u', 'drone', 'strike', 'partly', 'retaliation', 'orchestrate', 'attack', 'u', 'embassy', 'bagdad', 'follow', 'threat', 'u', 'president', 'commander', 'military', 'american', 'criminal', 'mob', 'hour', 'missile', 'strike', 'u', 'terrorist', 'force', 'warplane', 'around', 'country', 'increase', 'report', 'airstrikes', 'target', 'strategic', 'centre', 'country', 'report', 'numerous', 'defence', 'unit', 'target', 'radar', 'plate', 'iranian', 'arm', 'force', 'say', 'medium', 'release', 'post', 'country', 'staterun', 'islamic', 'republic', 'news', 'agency', 'cause', 'sensitivity', 'defence', 'iranian', 'arm', 'force', 'claim', 'left', 'tehran', 'imam', 'khomeini', 'international', 'airport', 'begin', 'fly', 'rotation', 'put', 'close', 'proximity', 'sensitive', 'military', 'centre', 'islamic', 'revolutionary', 'guard', 'corp', 'height', 'shape', 'hostile', 'say', 'iranian', 'military', 'circumstance', 'plane', 'accidentally', 'hit', 'human', 'error', 'unfortunately', 'result', 'martyrdom', 'dear', 'compatriot', 'death', 'number', 'foreign', 'national', 'say', 'admission', 'fault', 'come', 'several', 'day', 'denial', 'insistence', 'suffer', 'unspecified', 'mechanical', 'problem', 'tehran', 'say', 'missile', 'attack', 'allegation', 'scientifically', 'impossible', 'however', 'circumstance', 'surround', 'airliner', 'highly', 'suspicious', 'take', 'climbed', 'quickly', 'lose', 'altitude', 'crashed', 'ground', 'fire', 'pilot', 'make', 'distress', 'call', 'cockpit', 'video', 'social', 'medium', 'quickly', 'surface', 'missile', 'fly', 'night', 'sky', 'strike', 'airliner', 'area', 'crash', 'piece', 'information', 'begin', 'emerge', 'many', 'expert', 'observer', 'begin', 'suspect', 'exactly', 'iran', 'admit', 'illtrained', 'missile', 'unit', 'high', 'stress', 'poorly', 'coordinate', 'civilian', 'authority', 'mistakenly', 'shot', 'expert', 'believe', 'shot', 'russianmade', 'shortrange', 'surfacetoair', 'missile', 'battery', 'iran', 'pledge', 'carry', 'major', 'reform', 'operational', 'process', 'arm', 'force', 'make', 'error', 'impossible', 'future', 'country', 'offer', 'condolence', 'apologises', 'human', 'error']"
"The FAA has proposed to levy a $3.9 million fine on Southwest Airlines for operating more than 20,000 commercial flights with incorrect weight and balance calculations, potentially putting the safety of the flights at risk. The violations took place between 1 May and 9 August 2018, on 21,505 flights with 44 aircraft, the FAA alleges. The incorrect data included empty weight, centre of gravity or moment data. This information is used to determine the number of passengers and amount of fuel that can be carried, and how cargo is loaded, the FAA says in a statement on 10 January. “Southwest's operation of these aircraft was contrary to the airline's approved weight-and-balance programme and FAA-issued operations specifications,” the FAA says. Weight and balance calculations on any aircraft are critical to flight safety. Faulty or incomplete calculations can compromise the aircraft's structural integrity, and lead to tail strikes upon take-off or control difficulty in the air.

"The Federal Aviation Administration has proposed fining Boeing another $5.4 million for violations related to “slat tracks” installed on 178 737 Max. The fine, which does not relate to flight control issues the grounded the Max, comes roughly one month after the FAA slapped Boeing with a $3.9 million fine for the same issue involving 133 737NGs.  A Boeing 737 Max Boeing equipped the aircraft with slat tracks “weakened by a condition known as hydrogen embrittlement that occurred during cadmium-titanium plating”, says the FAA. Slat tracks guide slats on the aircraft's wings. The FAA says Boeing inadequately oversaw its suppliers and submitted 737s for FAA certification while knowing slats failed a strength test. A Georgia company called Kencoa Aerospace provided the slat tracks, which were plated by Southwest United Industries, based in Washington state, the FAA says. Southwest United shipped the slats to Spirit AeroSystems, which provided them to Boeing. The FAA already issued an airworthiness directive requiring airlines inspect slat tracks, and Boeing issued a service bulletin. “We will ensure that all inspections and any necessary part replacements are performed on all 737 Max before they return to service,” Boeing says in a statement to FlightGlobal. “We have not been informed of any in-service issues related to the slat tracks themselves.”",1,846,11.0,0.3384,"pilot, faa, issue, safety, include, report, require, training, ground, order","['federal', 'administration', 'propose', 'fin', 'another', 'violation', 'related', 'slat', 'track', 'instal', 'fine', 'relate', 'control', 'issue', 'ground', 'come', 'roughly', 'month', 'faa', 'slap', 'fine', 'issue', 'involve', 'equip', 'slat', 'track', 'weaken', 'condition', 'know', 'hydrogen', 'embrittlement', 'occur', 'cadmiumtitanium', 'plat', 'say', 'faa', 'slat', 'track', 'guide', 'slat', 'wing', 'faa', 'say', 'inadequately', 'oversaw', 'supplier', 'submit', 'faa', 'certification', 'know', 'slat', 'fail', 'strength', 'test', 'georgia', 'call', 'kencoa', 'provide', 'slat', 'track', 'plat', 'southwest', 'united', 'industry', 'base', 'washington', 'state', 'faa', 'say', 'southwest', 'united', 'ship', 'slat', 'spirit', 'aerosystems', 'provide', 'faa', 'already', 'issue', 'airworthiness', 'directive', 'require', 'inspect', 'slat', 'track', 'issue', 'service', 'bulletin', 'ensure', 'inspection', 'necessary', 'part', 'replacement', 'perform', 'return', 'service', 'say', 'statement', 'flightglobal', 'inform', 'inservice', 'issue', 'related', 'slat', 'track']"

"One of Russian carrier Nordwind's Airbus A321s has suffered serious nose-gear damage after a hard landing at Turkey's Antalya airport. The carrier says the aircraft had been conducting the flight from Moscow Sheremetyevo without passengers on 10 January. “While conducting a go-around, due to windshear, a hard landing occurred,” says the airline, adding that the aircraft subsequently made a safe landing. Inspection of the jet after its arrival, adds Nordwind, revealed that it had sustained damage to the nose-gear. Images on social media indicate that the underside of the fuselage in the area has been badly crumpled, and elements of the nose-gear assembly have been pushed upwards through the cabin floor behind the cockpit. “No-one was injured as a result of the event,” the airline adds. An unverified, but outwardly authentic, load report from the aircraft (VQ-BRS) has also been circulated online indicating that the aircraft experienced a 2.64g landing. It accompanies a handwritten pilot's report which states that the twinjet had conducted a stable approach to runway 36C before the hard landing, which the report attributes to windshear at the threshold. During the go-around the aircraft experienced instrument problems and the pilots, sensing smoke, donned oxygen masks and declared an emergency before carrying out a low pass over the runway for a visual check of the landing-gear. Further systems problems occurred, says the pilot report, and the emergency was reiterated before the crew carried out a visual approach and landing on runway 36C. Meteorological data for Antalya indicates that the airport had been experiencing winds of around 16kt, gusting to 26kt, around the time of the event.

"Deliveries of Falcon business jets dipped to 40 units in 2019, compared with 41 the previous year, with Dassault saying output for the period was five aircraft short of its 2019 guidance because of what it describes as “a difficult market”. The drop in output can be attributed largely to falling demand from China – previously one the strongest markets for Falcon jets – driven by a weak economy and trade tensions with the USA. Net Falcon orders for the year ended 31 December fell by two units to 40, resulting in a 1:1 book-to-bill ratio. The backlog is unchanged as a combined 53 for 7X, 8X and 900LX trijets, plus the twin-engined 2000LXS and in-development 6X. The superwide-cabin aircraft was launched in February 2018 as a replacement to the 5X programme, which Dassault axed two months earlier because of recurrent technical issues with the jet's Safran Silvercrest engines. Dassault says final assembly of the first 6X flight-test article is scheduled to begin early in the second quarter at its Bordeaux-Merignac plant, with first flight on target for 2021.

"Passenger numbers at Swedish airports declined 4% last year, to around 40 million, from an all-time high the previous year. Airports operator Swedavia acknowledges that concern around climate-change and the local anti-air-travel “flygskam” or “flight shame” movement as factors in the demand reduction, though it says: “We see a number of reasons concurring.” The national aviation tax, weak local currency, and a softening economic environment are cited by Swedavia as additional factors. It stresses the unprecedented air traffic growth between 2012 and last year as passenger numbers grew at around twice the 3% annual average of the past three decades. In 2019, the number of domestic passengers across Swedavia's 10 airports declined 9% to 12.4 million. International passenger numbers meanwhile fell 2% to 28 million. Stockholm Arlanda– the country's largest airport – saw passenger numbers decline 4% to 25.6 million. Domestic numbers declined at twice the rate of international numbers.

"Investigators have determined that failure to follow maintenance procedures resulted in a British Airways Airbus A319 experiencing in-flight control problems arising from a loose spoiler. While taxiing at London Gatwick on 2 April last year, the aircraft had returned to stand to resolve a flight-control status message, and two engineers discovered a faulty spoiler actuator. They commenced a maintenance procedure to deactivate the spoiler, which involved using a special tool – a spoiler maintenance key – to place the spoiler into the 'maintenance' position. The UK Air Accidents Investigation Branch says the work was carried out in cold and wet weather, and the engineers had difficulty using the handheld tablet with the maintenance information. Although an operational test was carried out, a check to see if the spoiler could be manually raised was not. Despite having a 'remove before flight' tag, the key remained installed after the A319 was dispatched for its flight to Palma de Mallorca.  Pilots experienced uncommanded roll as the spoiler floated during flight In this configuration the spoiler was able to float upwards from stowed position which caused the crew to experience flight-control problems en route. While in cruise the aircraft was flying 2° left-wing down, with right rudder trim, and vibrating. The crew consulted with the carrier's maintenance control and a cabin crew member was asked to check the wing visually. When full flap was selected during the approach, the aircraft rolled “noticeably” to the left, says the inquiry, undergoing light buffeting and deviating from flight-director command bars. Disengaging the autopilot on approach introduced a further roll to the left, which was controlled by the pilot. “The aircraft was out of trim and required continual sidestick input, sometimes to nearly full extent, to maintain the approach profile,” says the inquiry, but the crew landed without incident.

Safety investigations by the carrier, conducted immediately after the incident, found that the engineers at Gatwick had not correctly followed the aircraft maintenance manual procedure, adding that they had been distracted while trying to carry out an unfamiliar task in bad weather. The airline's probe recommended several measure to prevent a recurrence, including easing access to – and presentation of – maintenance data. “We worked closely with the AAIB who were happy with our internal investigation and resulting actions that we have already undertaken,” says British Airways, which stresses that its pilots handled the problem and safely landed with no injuries to passengers or damage to the aircraft.",1,852,6.0,0.3116,"engine, maintenance, fuel, takeoff, result, failure, system, problem, power, issue","['investigator', 'determine', 'failure', 'follow', 'maintenance', 'procedure', 'result', 'british', 'airway', 'experience', 'inflight', 'control', 'problem', 'arise', 'loose', 'spoiler', 'taxi', 'london', 'gatwick', 'april', 'return', 'stand', 'resolve', 'flightcontrol', 'status', 'message', 'engineer', 'discover', 'faulty', 'spoiler', 'actuator', 'commenced', 'maintenance', 'procedure', 'deactivate', 'spoiler', 'involve', 'use', 'special', 'tool', 'spoiler', 'maintenance', 'key', 'place', 'spoiler', 'position', 'uk', 'accident', 'investigation', 'branch', 'say', 'work', 'carry', 'cold', 'wet', 'weather', 'engineer', 'difficulty', 'use', 'handheld', 'tablet', 'maintenance', 'information', 'although', 'operational', 'test', 'carry', 'check', 'see', 'spoiler', 'manually', 'raise', 'despite', 'tag', 'key', 'remain', 'instal', 'dispatch', 'palma', 'de', 'mallorca', 'pilot', 'experienced', 'uncommanded', 'roll', 'spoiler', 'float', 'configuration', 'spoiler', 'able', 'float', 'upwards', 'stow', 'position', 'cause', 'crew', 'experience', 'flightcontrol', 'problem', 'en', 'route', 'cruise', 'fly', 'leftwing', 'right', 'rudder', 'trim', 'vibrate', 'crew', 'consult', 'carrier', 'maintenance', 'control', 'cabin', 'crew', 'member', 'ask', 'check', 'wing', 'visually', 'full', 'flap', 'select', 'approach', 'roll', 'noticeably', 'left', 'say', 'inquiry', 'undergo', 'light', 'buffeting', 'deviate', 'flightdirector', 'command', 'bar', 'disengage', 'autopilot', 'approach', 'introduce', 'far', 'roll', 'left', 'control', 'pilot', 'trim', 'require', 'continual', 'sidestick', 'input', 'sometimes', 'nearly', 'full', 'extent', 'maintain', 'approach', 'profile', 'say', 'inquiry', 'crew', 'land', 'without', 'incident', 'spoiler', 'subsequently', 'deactivate', 'correctly', 'safety', 'investigation', 'carrier', 'conduct', 'immediately', 'incident', 'found', 'engineer', 'gatwick', 'correctly', 'follow', 'maintenance', 'manual', 'procedure', 'add', 'distract', 'try', 'carry', 'unfamiliar', 'task', 'bad', 'weather', 'probe', 'recommend', 'several', 'measure', 'prevent', 'recurrence', 'include', 'ease', 'access', 'presentation', 'maintenance', 'data', 'work', 'closely', 'aaib', 'happy', 'internal', 'investigation', 'result', 'action', 'already', 'undertaken', 'say', 'british', 'airway', 'stress', 'pilot', 'handle', 'problem', 'safely', 'land', 'injury', 'passenger', 'damage']"
"Ukraine's president has adopted a cautious approach over the Boeing 737-800 crash in Iran, as evidence mounts that the aircraft was brought down by a missile strike. President Volodymyr Zelensky stresses that the theory of a surface-to-air missile attack has not been confirmed but adds that it has not been ruled out. He is urging international allies to submit whatever data is available on the 8 January crash to support the investigation commission probing the fatal loss of the Ukraine International Airlines aircraft. Some 45 Ukrainian personnel are participating in the investigation which, under ICAO standards, is being led by Iran. “Given the recent statements by the leaders of the states to the media, we call on all international partners, especially the governments of the USA, Canada and the UK, to submit data and evidence relating to the disaster for the use by the commission of inquiry,” says Zelensky. All nine crew members of the aircraft were Ukrainian, and Ukrainian citizens were among the 167 passengers of the Kiev-bound flight. Several Canadian passengers were on board and Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau gave a forthright statement on 9 January, claiming that there was strong evidence that an inadvertent missile attack had been responsible for the crash. Zelensky says he plans to discuss the investigation with US secretary of state Mike Pompeo. ”Our goal is to establish the undeniable truth,” he says. “We consider it a responsibility of the entire international community.”",1,853,10.0,0.4268,"international, authority, civil, state, investigation, case, add, january, airasia, crash","['ukraine', 'president', 'adopt', 'cautious', 'approach', 'crash', 'iran', 'evidence', 'mount', 'brought', 'missile', 'strike', 'president', 'volodymyr', 'zelensky', 'stress', 'theory', 'surfacetoair', 'missile', 'attack', 'confirm', 'add', 'rule', 'urge', 'international', 'ally', 'submit', 'whatever', 'data', 'available', 'january', 'crash', 'support', 'investigation', 'commission', 'probe', 'fatal', 'loss', 'ukraine', 'international', 'ukrainian', 'personnel', 'participate', 'investigation', 'icao', 'standard', 'lead', 'iran', 'give', 'recent', 'statement', 'leader', 'state', 'medium', 'call', 'international', 'partner', 'especially', 'government', 'usa', 'canada', 'uk', 'submit', 'data', 'evidence', 'relate', 'disaster', 'use', 'commission', 'inquiry', 'say', 'zelensky', 'crew', 'member', 'ukrainian', 'ukrainian', 'citizen', 'among', 'passenger', 'kievbound', 'several', 'canadian', 'passenger', 'board', 'canadian', 'prime', 'minister', 'justin', 'trudeau', 'give', 'forthright', 'statement', 'january', 'claim', 'strong', 'evidence', 'inadvertent', 'missile', 'attack', 'responsible', 'crash', 'zelensky', 'say', 'plan', 'discus', 'investigation', 'u', 'secretary', 'state', 'mike', 'pompeo', 'goal', 'establish', 'undeniable', 'truth', 'say', 'consider', 'responsibility', 'entire', 'international', 'community']"
"The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has designated a representative to participate in the Iran-led investigation into the 8 January crash of Ukraine International Airlines flight PS752.

"Canadian and US officials believe Iranian military forces, possibly by mistake, shot down the Ukraine International Airlines Boeing 737-800 that crashed outside Tehran on 8 January, killing 176 people. “The evidence indicates that the plane was shot down by an Iranian surface-to-air missile,” Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau tells reporters on 9 January. Canada reached that conclusion, which Iran has denied, after reviewing “intelligence from multiple sources, including our allies and our own intelligence.” The crash of Ukraine flight PS752 came in the tense hours after Iran launched missile strikes against US-occupied bases in Iraq, a response to the US military's killing of Iranian general Qasem Soleimani. Trudeau adds that Iran's actions may have been “unintentional” or “accidental”, but stresses that officials remain uncertain about circumstances surrounding the alleged missile strike. Canada's assessment aligns with that of US officials, who told news outlets on 9 January that a surface-to-air missile downed the 737. US officials said heat signatures from two surface-to-air missiles had been detected immediately prior to an explosion near where the aircraft was flying, according to reports. Trudeau says the conclusion that Iranian military forces downed the aircraft “reconfirms the need for a thorough investigation” into the crash. Canadian foreign minister Francois-Philippe Champagne has already told his Iranian counterpart that “Canadian officials must immediately be granted access to Iran, to be granted consular services, to identify victims and participate in a thorough investigation”, Trudeau says. He says Iran has expressed “an openness to Canadian involvement in the investigation from the beginning”. But Trudeau provides no confirmation of Canada's involvement, and Iran has said it intends to keep the aircraft's cockpit voice and flight data recorders within its borders. The aircraft took off from Tehran at 06:13 local time on 8 January and climbed westward to 8,000ft before disappearing from radar, Iran has said. Purported video of the crash shows a fiery object, breaking apart and falling from the sky. Ali Abedzadeh, head of Iran's Civil Aviation Organisation, said it is “scientifically impossible” that a missile downed the aircraft, noting close cooperation between Iran's civil and military sectors. Prime minister Trudeau says he has spoken to Netherlands prime minister Mark Rutte about the Netherlands' experience investigating the crash of Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 in 2014. Dutch investigators determined a Russian missile downed that aircraft, a 777-200. On Thursday, some European airlines decided to aviod Iran airspace altogether as a precautionary measure. Lufthansa's daily direct flight from Frankfurt to Teheran, LH600, was turned around over Romaina and is currently returning to Germany. Austrian Airlines flight OS871 from Vienna to Teheran landed in Sofia, according to flight tracking website Flightradar24.

"Australian investigators are probing an overrun during landing by a QantasLink Fokker 100 at the remote Newman airport in the west of the country. The aircraft stopped about 100m beyond the far end of runway 05, which has a length of about 2,000m. None of the passengers or crew members on the jet (VH-NHY), which was operating a service from Perth on 9 January, was injured. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau says it will be reviewing flight data, interviewing the flight crew, and examining the runway conditions. Meteorological data from Newman airport at the time indicates crosswinds from the south-east at 22kt, gusting to 33kt, with visibility of 1,400m.

"Iranian investigators have established a working group to examine the possibility of unlawful action against the Ukraine International Airlines Boeing 737-800 which crashed outside Tehran on 8 January. The Civil Aviation Organisation says it has set up several groups to look into various aspects of the crash, in line with ICAO standards. But it also says that, given the evidence of a fire on the aircraft, an additional group is being convened to investigate any unlawful action. CAO chief Ali Abedzadeh insists that a missile strike on the 737 would have been “scientifically impossible”, pointing out that other domestic and international aircraft were operating in Iranian airspace at the same time. He adds that there is “complete co-ordination” between military and civil sectors in Iran. While there is no verified evidence of a missile attack on the aircraft, the circumstances of the crash make the possibility of hostile action – albeit unintentional – difficult to dismiss so early into the investigation, particularly with the apparent outbreak of fire within moments of departure. Most notable is the timing of the event, coinciding with heightened military activity as Iranian defence forces launched an overnight missile attack on US targets in Iraq. Ukraine International Airlines has already disclosed that the crew was highly experienced. The aircraft was delivered new in 2016 and was fitted with CFM International CFM56 engines – powerplants with a high level of reliability. There is no immediate indication of a powerplant problem but, even with a serious uncontained failure, the rapid loss of control and destruction of the aircraft – given that pilots are routinely trained to deal with engine failure after take-off – would be highly unusual. The absence of a distress call or other transmission could point to the crew's prioritising the handling of the aircraft. But the sudden cessation of publicly-available data transmissions from the aircraft, as it climbed to its assigned altitude, could also indirectly indicate a situation that overwhelmed its systems. Most of the occupants of the aircraft held Iranian passports, according to the inquiry, and Ukrainian-Iranian relations have recently appeared sound – Iranian president Hassan Rouhani mentioned strong and friendly relations between the two countries in an independence day message to his Ukrainian counterpart in August. This would suggest that a deliberate attack on the 737 is unlikely, but does not rule out an inadvertent mishap. CAO chief Abedzadeh denies that Iranian authorities are resisting transferring the flight recorders of the aircraft to US investigators for analysis, but points out that the inquiry has various options for seeking assistance to download the recorder information – including sending the devices to France or another third country. Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelensky, has ordered a routine criminal investigation into the crash, through the country's prosecutor general. He has also insisted that all civil aircraft in the Ukrainian fleet will undergo an airworthiness review, to verify their technical condition. “Regardless of the conclusions regarding the causes of the Iranian catastrophe, the airworthiness of the entire civilian fleet will be tested,” says Zelensky. “Undoubtedly, the priority for Ukraine is to identify the causes of the aircraft crash,” he adds. “We will find out the truth. A thorough and independent investigation will be conducted in accordance with international law.” Zelensky says a large team of Ukrainian representatives has been sent to Iran to participate in the probe, in particular the downloading and analysis of the aircraft's flight recorders. Ukrainian airlines are being banned from flying in Iranian and Iraqi airspace until all the reasons for the crash are established, he adds.",1,857,10.0,0.4429,"international, authority, civil, state, investigation, case, add, january, airasia, crash","['iranian', 'investigator', 'establish', 'work', 'examine', 'possibility', 'unlawful', 'action', 'ukraine', 'international', 'crashed', 'outside', 'tehran', 'january', 'civil', 'organisation', 'say', 'set', 'several', 'look', 'various', 'aspect', 'crash', 'line', 'icao', 'standard', 'say', 'give', 'evidence', 'fire', 'additional', 'convene', 'investigate', 'unlawful', 'action', 'cao', 'chief', 'ali', 'abedzadeh', 'insists', 'missile', 'strike', 'scientifically', 'impossible', 'point', 'domestic', 'international', 'operating', 'iranian', 'airspace', 'add', 'complete', 'coordination', 'military', 'civil', 'sector', 'iran', 'verify', 'evidence', 'missile', 'attack', 'circumstance', 'crash', 'make', 'possibility', 'hostile', 'action', 'albeit', 'unintentional', 'difficult', 'dismiss', 'early', 'investigation', 'particularly', 'apparent', 'outbreak', 'fire', 'within', 'moment', 'departure', 'notable', 'timing', 'event', 'coincide', 'heighten', 'military', 'activity', 'iranian', 'defence', 'force', 'launch', 'overnight', 'missile', 'attack', 'u', 'target', 'iraq', 'ukraine', 'international', 'already', 'disclose', 'crew', 'highly', 'experienced', 'deliver', 'fit', 'cfm', 'international', 'engine', 'powerplants', 'high', 'level', 'reliability', 'immediate', 'indication', 'powerplant', 'problem', 'even', 'serious', 'uncontained', 'failure', 'rapid', 'loss', 'control', 'destruction', 'give', 'pilot', 'routinely', 'train', 'deal', 'engine', 'failure', 'takeoff', 'highly', 'unusual', 'absence', 'distress', 'call', 'transmission', 'point', 'crew', 'prioritise', 'handle', 'sudden', 'cessation', 'publiclyavailable', 'data', 'transmission', 'climbed', 'assign', 'altitude', 'indirectly', 'indicate', 'situation', 'overwhelmed', 'system', 'occupant', 'held', 'iranian', 'passport', 'accord', 'inquiry', 'ukrainianiranian', 'relation', 'recently', 'appear', 'sound', 'iranian', 'president', 'hassan', 'rouhani', 'mention', 'strong', 'friendly', 'relation', 'country', 'independence', 'day', 'message', 'ukrainian', 'counterpart', 'august', 'suggest', 'deliberate', 'attack', 'unlikely', 'rule', 'inadvertent', 'mishap', 'cao', 'chief', 'abedzadeh', 'denies', 'iranian', 'authority', 'resist', 'transfer', 'recorder', 'u', 'investigator', 'analysis', 'point', 'inquiry', 'various', 'option', 'seek', 'assistance', 'download', 'recorder', 'information', 'include', 'send', 'device', 'france', 'another', 'third', 'country', 'ukraine', 'president', 'volodymyr', 'zelensky', 'order', 'routine', 'criminal', 'investigation', 'crash', 'country', 'prosecutor', 'general', 'insist', 'civil', 'ukrainian', 'fleet', 'undergo', 'airworthiness', 'review', 'verify', 'technical', 'condition', 'regardless', 'conclusion', 'regard', 'cause', 'iranian', 'catastrophe', 'airworthiness', 'entire', 'civilian', 'fleet', 'test', 'say', 'zelensky', 'undoubtedly', 'priority', 'ukraine', 'identify', 'cause', 'crash', 'add', 'find', 'truth', 'thorough', 'independent', 'investigation', 'conduct', 'accordance', 'international', 'zelensky', 'say', 'large', 'team', 'ukrainian', 'representative', 'sent', 'iran', 'participate', 'probe', 'particular', 'download', 'analysis', 'recorder', 'ukrainian', 'ban', 'fly', 'iranian', 'iraqi', 'airspace', 'reason', 'crash', 'establish', 'add']"
"Garuda Indonesia expects to return to profitability in 2019, owing to higher yields during the year. The carrier last posted an operating profit of $171 million for the quarter ended 30 September. Operating revenue rose 10% year-on-year to $1.35 billion, and net profit came in at $99 million. In comparison, its restated 2018 results reported an operating loss of $139 million for the full year, though net loss narrowed to $179 million. Revenue came in at $4.37 billion. However, its bottom line could be eroded by an impairment cost from the loss of a management deal its low-cost subsidiary Citilink previously had with Sriwijaya Air. Both sides could not overcome a deadlock over the appointment of a new management team and ended the partnership last November. In a series of twists and turns, Sriwijaya's board of commissioners dismissed three senior executives seconded from Citilink in September without providing an explanation but agreed to resume the deal in October. Going forward, Garuda Indonesia will focus on raising the yields on its international services rather than depend on a high load factor or passenger traffic. It plans to do so through network partnerships with alliance and non-alliance partners, along with expanding its cargo business, it says at a recent event detailing the past year's operating performance. The carrier adds that it has extended aircraft leases from 12 years to 15 years but did not specify the aircraft type. At the same time, it is not planning for any capital expenditures in 2020, apart from the aircraft maintenance reserves.

"Flight recorders from the crashed Ukraine International Airlines Boeing 737-800 in Tehran have been retrieved, with their memory units, although both have signs of physical damage. But there are no firm indications as to the circumstances of the 8 January event, including whether it might have been the result of hostile action or sabotage. The Iranian Civil Aviation Organisation says both the flight-data and cockpit-voice recorders were recovered from the wreckage of the jet after it came down shortly after take-off from Tehran Imam Khomeini airport. It states that the aircraft initially climbed to 8,000ft before radar contact was lost and the jet struck the ground. Ukraine International Airlines concurs with this figure, putting the altitude at about 2,400m (7,900ft). “No radio transmissions from the pilot were received regarding unusual circumstances,” says the Civil Aviation Organisation's chief, Ali Abedzadeh. The aircraft's trajectory was initially westwards, he says, but the jet started to turn right as the problem emerged, and appears to have been heading back to the airport. Abedzadeh says that preliminary information – from eyewitnesses on the ground at crews at altitude – indicate the aircraft was on fire, before its impact with terrain and subsequent explosion. The initial ground impact was in the vicinity of an amusement park, he says. Officials in Ukraine and the USA have been notified along with governments in Sweden and Canada. Ukraine has been formally invited to participate in the accident inquiry. Abedzadeh says 146 of the 167 passengers and nine crew members held Iranian passports. He says the aircraft left the stand at 05:45 before its take-off at 06:13, and was initially cleared to Mehrabad control which cleared it to climb to 26,000ft. Contact was lost at 06:18 and the aircraft came down near the province of Saba Shahr. The Civil Aviation Organisation says, in a preliminary document, that the aircraft started to taxi at 06:05. No conclusions have been released on the circumstances of the crash. The aircraft was less than four years old, and powered by CFM International CFM56 engines. Preliminary weather data from Tehran indicates no adverse conditions at the time. Ukraine International Airlines says the captain had logged 11,600h on 737s including 5,500 in command, while the first officer had 7,600h on type. The flight crew was augmented by an instructor pilot with 12,000h on 737s including 6,600h as captain. It adds that Tehran is not a “simple” airport and that the carrier has, for several years, used Imam Khomeini as a training location for 737 crews to check pilot proficiency. ”Given the crew's experience, error probability is minimal,” the airline claims. “We do not even consider such a chance.”",1,859,10.0,0.2894,"international, authority, civil, state, investigation, case, add, january, airasia, crash","['recorder', 'crashed', 'ukraine', 'international', 'tehran', 'retrieve', 'memory', 'unit', 'although', 'sign', 'physical', 'damage', 'firm', 'indication', 'circumstance', 'january', 'event', 'include', 'whether', 'might', 'result', 'hostile', 'action', 'sabotage', 'iranian', 'civil', 'organisation', 'say', 'flightdata', 'cockpitvoice', 'recorder', 'recover', 'wreckage', 'jet', 'come', 'shortly', 'takeoff', 'tehran', 'imam', 'khomeini', 'airport', 'state', 'initially', 'climbed', 'radar', 'contact', 'lose', 'jet', 'struck', 'ground', 'ukraine', 'international', 'concurs', 'figure', 'put', 'altitude', 'radio', 'transmission', 'pilot', 'receive', 'regard', 'unusual', 'circumstance', 'say', 'civil', 'organisation', 'chief', 'ali', 'abedzadeh', 'trajectory', 'initially', 'westward', 'say', 'jet', 'start', 'turn', 'right', 'problem', 'emerge', 'appear', 'head', 'back', 'airport', 'abedzadeh', 'say', 'preliminary', 'information', 'eyewitness', 'ground', 'crew', 'altitude', 'indicate', 'fire', 'impact', 'terrain', 'subsequent', 'explosion', 'initial', 'ground', 'impact', 'vicinity', 'amusement', 'park', 'say', 'official', 'ukraine', 'usa', 'notify', 'along', 'government', 'sweden', 'canada', 'ukraine', 'formally', 'invite', 'participate', 'accident', 'inquiry', 'abedzadeh', 'say', 'passenger', 'crew', 'member', 'held', 'iranian', 'passport', 'say', 'left', 'stand', 'takeoff', 'initially', 'clear', 'mehrabad', 'control', 'clear', 'climb', 'contact', 'lose', 'come', 'near', 'province', 'saba', 'shahr', 'civil', 'organisation', 'say', 'preliminary', 'document', 'start', 'taxi', 'conclusion', 'release', 'circumstance', 'crash', 'less', 'old', 'power', 'cfm', 'international', 'engine', 'preliminary', 'weather', 'data', 'tehran', 'indicates', 'adverse', 'condition', 'ukraine', 'international', 'say', 'captain', 'log', 'include', 'command', 'officer', 'type', 'crew', 'augment', 'instructor', 'pilot', 'include', 'captain', 'add', 'tehran', 'simple', 'airport', 'carrier', 'several', 'use', 'imam', 'khomeini', 'training', 'location', 'crew', 'check', 'pilot', 'proficiency', 'give', 'crew', 'experience', 'error', 'probability', 'minimal', 'claim', 'even', 'consider', 'chance']"
"The cost to buy new aircraft to maintain the US Navy's (USN) current fleet size is projected to be about $380 billion over the next 30 years. The replacement of fighter and attack aircraft, such as the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II and the Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornet would represent the largest overall costs between 2020 and 2050, totaling about $190 billion, according to a projection by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), released on 6 January. The USN and US Marine Corps (USMC) operate a fleet of more than 4,000 aircraft, consisting of 60 different models, says the CBO. However, over the next 30 years a small number of high-performance aircraft would make up a majority of future replacement costs. “The two most costly categories are fighter and attack aircraft and the Marine Corps' combat rotorcraft, [such as] helicopters and tiltrotors, which together make up more than 80% of the costs that CBO projects for 2020 through 2050,” says the CBO. “Just the top five most expensive systems, which are in the same categories, account for more than 60% of total projected aircraft procurement costs.” Much of those costs are because the USMC and USN are currently buying large numbers of F-35B and F-35C aircraft, which are to replace more than half of the services' fighter and attack aircraft fleets, made of the aging McDonnell Douglas F/A-18A-D Hornet and McDonnell Douglas AV-8B Harrier II, says the CBO. Eventually, the USN will have to turn its attention, and its dollars, to developing and buying its next generation of fighter and attack aircraft, the FA-XX. That aircraft is to replace the service's about 500 F/A-18E/F Super Hornets, which are to start reaching the end of service life in the mid-2030s. The CBO anticipates the service would start production in 2032 of the FA-XX. The agency projects that the FA-XX would cost $67 billion for the first 448 aircraft.

"Airlines operating between Asia and Europe are rapidly adjusting their flightpaths to avoid Iranian and Iraqi airspace, following military conflict between Iranian and US forces in Iraq and the crash of a Ukrainian International Airlines Boeing 737 after take-off from Tehran. KLM, Lufthansa and Air France have all said they are avoiding the two countries' airspace until further notice, and their flights to several Southeast Asian and Middle Eastern destinations will adhere to alternative routings. Lufthansa has cancelled its flights to Iranian capital Tehran and Erbil in northern Iraq. “As soon as we have detailed information, we will decide if and when flight operations to/from Tehran and Erbil can be resumed,” says the German airline. Qantas's flights between Australia and Europe are being rerouted, adding 40-50min to the flight time of its direct service between London and Perth. “As a result, we will need to reduce the number of passengers on board in order to carry more fuel,” notes the Australian carrier. Due to prevailing winds, however, its London-Perth flights have so far been unaffected and are carrying a full passenger load with a normal flight duration. Singapore Airlines says its flights have been avoiding Iranian airspace since 6 January, an action that has not significantly extended flight times to Europe. Malaysia Airlines likewise says it is avoiding Iranian airspace. UAE-based Emirates and Flydubai have cancelled their scheduled services to Baghdad on 8 January. The US Federal Aviation Administration has banned American carriers and pilots from using Iranian and Iraqi airspace, as well as some parts of the Persian Gulf, citing the “potential for miscalculation or misidentification” for civilian aircraft in the region.",1,861,10.0,0.2374,"international, authority, civil, state, investigation, case, add, january, airasia, crash","['operating', 'asia', 'europe', 'rapidly', 'adjust', 'flightpaths', 'avoid', 'iranian', 'iraqi', 'airspace', 'follow', 'military', 'conflict', 'iranian', 'u', 'force', 'iraq', 'crash', 'ukrainian', 'international', 'takeoff', 'tehran', 'klm', 'lufthansa', 'france', 'say', 'avoid', 'country', 'airspace', 'far', 'notice', 'several', 'southeast', 'asian', 'middle', 'eastern', 'destination', 'adhere', 'alternative', 'routings', 'lufthansa', 'cancel', 'iranian', 'capital', 'tehran', 'erbil', 'northern', 'iraq', 'soon', 'detailed', 'information', 'decide', 'operation', 'tehran', 'erbil', 'resume', 'say', 'german', 'qantas', 'australia', 'europe', 'rerouted', 'add', 'direct', 'service', 'london', 'perth', 'result', 'need', 'reduce', 'number', 'passenger', 'board', 'order', 'carry', 'fuel', 'note', 'australian', 'carrier', 'due', 'prevail', 'wind', 'however', 'londonperth', 'far', 'unaffected', 'carry', 'full', 'passenger', 'load', 'normal', 'duration', 'singapore', 'say', 'avoid', 'iranian', 'airspace', 'since', 'january', 'action', 'significantly', 'extend', 'europe', 'malaysia', 'likewise', 'say', 'avoid', 'iranian', 'airspace', 'uaebased', 'emirate', 'flydubai', 'cancel', 'schedule', 'service', 'baghdad', 'january', 'u', 'federal', 'administration', 'ban', 'american', 'carrier', 'pilot', 'use', 'iranian', 'iraqi', 'airspace', 'well', 'part', 'persian', 'gulf', 'cite', 'potential', 'miscalculation', 'misidentification', 'civilian', 'region']"

"US operators have been prohibited from operating in Iranian and Iraqi airspace in relation to the geopolitical tensions and the potential risk to civil air traffic. The US FAA's restriction also covers the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman. It states that the heightened military activities and increased political tensions in the region pose an “inadvertent risk” to US civil aviation. The risk arises from the potential for “miscalculation or misidentification”. Iranian Civil Aviation Organisation deputy director Morteza Dehghan had stated, on 7 January, that the country's airspace was safe and that no international restrictions had been imposed on flights from Iran. Iranian investigators have started a probe into the loss of a Ukraine International Airlines Boeing 737-800 which came down shortly after departure from Tehran's Imam Khomeini airport on 8 January. While there is no immediate evidence that the crash resulted from hostile action, military activity overnight – including the firing of missiles at Iraqi bases – has inevitably introduced additional complexity to the investigation.

"Iranian investigators have formally identified a Ukraine International Airlines Boeing 737-800 which crashed shortly after take-off from Tehran's Imam Khomeini airport. The Civil Aviation Organisation says the twinjet was registered UR-PSR and had been bound for Kiev. It states that the aircraft took off at 06:12, operating as flight PS752, but lost contact with air traffic control at 06:18, just 6min later. Take-off was conducted from Imam Khomeini's runway 29R. The CAO states that the aircraft came near in a district of Tehran called Saba Shahr. This area lies to the north-west of the airport. Preliminary indications, it adds, point to no survivors among the 167 passengers and nine crew members. Meteorological data from Imam Khomeini airport indicate temperatures marginally below freezing but no adverse weather otherwise. “Investigation and rescue teams have been sent to the accident site,” says the CAO. “The process of data collection and accident investigation has begun.” Most of the occupants were Iranian nationals, it adds, although citizens from other nations were also on board. Ukraine International Airlines says the aircraft disappeared from radar contact “just minutes after departure” from Tehran. It says it is still working to determine the precise number of passengers on board the jet. The carrier says it is suspending flights to Tehran “indefinitely” in the aftermath of the accident, although it has not indicated whether this relates directly to the crash or the recent US-Iranian political tensions. UIA states that it is “working closely with the aviation authorities”, to “do its best” to find out the causes of the accident. It adds that the aircraft entered its fleet in 2016, directly from the manufacturing facility, and underwent scheduled maintenance on 6 January 2020.

"Investigators in the Bahamas have ended an inquiry into a Douglas DC-3 ditching after being unable to retrieve the aircraft for detailed analysis. The DC-3 (N437GB) – manufactured in 1945 – had been operated by Atlantic Air Cargo on a service to Nassau's Lynden Pindling airport on 18 October last year. It was some 2.9nm from runway 14, north-west of the airport, when it came down in the sea. Bahamian accident investigation authority AAID says two people had been on board, and the pilot had reported a left-hand engine failure 25-30nm from the airport. “The pilot further stated that, during single engine operation, the aircraft performance was not optimal so the decision was made to land the aircraft in the ocean,” it states, adding that rescue personnel were notified. While the ditching was successful and neither of occupant was injured, the aircraft subsequently “could not be located” for physical analysis. The DC-3 was powered by two Pratt & Whitney R-1830 radial engines. Investigators state that visual conditions prevailed and weather was “not a factor”.

"Scandinavian budget carrier Norwegian's 2019 capacity was 1% higher than the previous year despite its pledge of zero growth as part of efforts to return to profitability. However, the airline slashed capacity by a quarter in December and saw its unit revenue for the month rise 21%. Full-year unit revenue was up 7% in 2019. Traffic growth for the year, as measured in revenue passenger-kilometres, was double the 1% capacity increase, resulting in a 0.8 percentage point rise in load factor to 86.6%. New chief executive Jacob Schram, who took the helm earlier this month, says that throughout 2019 Norwegian “worked on reducing the capacity in line with demand and worked continuously to set a route structure adapted to the large seasonal fluctuations across the industry”. He praises the airline's employees for making “an impressive effort delivering on the strategy of moving from growth to profitability”, although the airline acknowledges that the 1% capacity growth last year was “a little over the previously announced zero growth”. Norwegian made a full-year operating loss of NKr3.85 billion ($438 million) in 2018, having pursued an aggressive growth strategy across Europe and on transatlantic routes. It has since scaled back its expansion plans by selling aircraft and axing unprofitable routes. These measures helped deliver a 64% rise in third-quarter 2019 operating profit, to NKr2.97 billion, and a nine-month operating profit of NKr2.13 billion. The airline sought additional funding from investors through a convertible bond issue and the release of new shares in November, in a bid to relieve financial pressure. Norwegian is also awaiting compensation from Boeing for its grounded 737 Max fleet. The carrier had 18 Max jets in service at the time of the aircraft's global grounding. Cirium fleets data shows that Norwegian has a further 92 Max jets on order. The airline said in July that the grounding would negatively impact its 2019 financial results by NKr700 million.

"Bek Air is still pushing its theory that wake turbulence contributed to the loss of a Fokker 100 during take-off from Almaty, and is also indicating that the proximity of buildings should be examined by the inquiry. The airline has released further flight data which, it says, has been obtained from the aircraft – including rudder and aileron positions, engine power, and wind speed information. Little context or clarification accompanies the data, however, which appears to cover a longer time interval than the 36s previously disclosed. It appears to show the ailerons, rudder and elevators were active during rotation, as the aircraft experienced lateral and longitudinal instability during the brief period it was fully airborne. Some of the data – such as the airspeed – is discontinuous, suggesting it has been sourced only after the jet lifted off, while other information, like sudden changes in wind speed and direction, is likely to be unreliable because the aircraft, having descended back to the ground, subsequently travelled at an unusual attitude, barely above the terrain. After the aircraft lost height, the data suggests thrust on both Rolls-Royce Tay engines simultaneously reduced for around 10s before increasing to a higher level than before the power dip. Bek Air has acknowledged the surveillance video showing the de-icing of the aircraft's horizontal stabiliser, a video which does not indicate any de-icing of the wings. The airline has released a document on de-icing fluid hold-over times, which appears to highlight a figure of 45min for Type I fluid in frost below minus 10C. Such fluids are not particularly viscous and are intended for short-term use. Bek Air has also published documentation detailing the threat from wake vortices and the efforts to counter the problem.

"American Airlines says it has come to a confidential agreement with Boeing to compensate it for the losses it incurred due to the grounding of the 737 Max following two fatal accidents, and that it will be sharing the compensation with its employees. In October, the Fort-Worth-based airline's chief executive Doug Parker said the grounding of the fleet of 24 Max aircraft had cost it up to $540 million in pre-tax profit in 2019 and forced it to cancel thousands of flights. American still has 76 Max aircraft on order. “Our ability as an airline to weather these unprecedented times is thanks to our phenomenal team, and it was important to us that we get a deal done this year,” Parker says in a statement published on 6 January. “On behalf of the board of directors, we are proud to take the step of including this compensation in our 2019 profit-sharing programme, even though the compensation will be received over several years.” Earlier in the day, Aeromexico also announced a confidential agreement with the Chicago-based planemaker for damages associated with the grounding, which is now in its 10thmonth. Turkish Airlines and Southwest also announced agreements with Boeing recently. American adds that the company's board has authorised a discretionary portion of the settlement to be returned to employees as part of the 2019 profit sharing programme. “The profit-sharing award is based on the company's estimate of projected full-year 2019 financial damages for the MAX groundings. An additional accrual of more than $30 million will be made to the airline's 2019 profit-sharing programme, which is expected to be distributed to American's team members in March 2020.” The prospects for returning the 737 Max to service remain bleak, as the Federal Aviation Administration continues to scrutinise the programme. The regulatory body has not indicated when it could re-certificate the aircraft, repeatedly saying that it would not do so until it determines that it is safe. It has been grounded since March 2019 after the second of two fatal accidents which killed a total of 346 passengers and crew. American Airlines has taken the plane out of its schedule through 6 April.

"Investigators have yet to establish the root cause of a fan-blade fracture involved in an engine failure affecting an Air France Airbus A380. The US FAA states that the reason for the first-stage low-pressure compressor blade fracture is “still undetermined” in an interim directive requiring further precautionary action on Engine Alliance GP7200 powerplants. Its directive refers to an in-flight shutdown on a 10 March 2019 service, following the fracture of two first-stage low-pressure compressor blades. While it does not specify the airframe involved, an Air France A380 returned to Abidjan with GP7200 failure on this date. “After an analysis of these fractures, the manufacturer determined the fan blades experienced cracks that originated on the internal surface of the convex airfoil and propagated to the point of failure,” states the FAA. “The cracks originated in a microtexture area that can result in a low-cycle fatigue debit that may allow a crack to initiate and propagate to failure.” Operators with GP7200-powered A380s with certain blades fitted are being instructed to conduct ultrasonic inspections and replace any blades which fail the check. Blades which have undertaken 3,250 cycles or more since new must be checked within 250 cycles. The measures take effect from 14 January.

"Canadian investigators have opened a probe into the overrun at Halifax Stanfield airport by a WestJet Boeing 737-800 which was arriving from Toronto on 5 January. The aircraft had been approaching the waypoint TETAR – some 11nm north-west of the airport – when it was told that the intended arrival runway 14 was experiencing crosswinds of 14kt, gusting to 23kt, with a visual range of 4,000ft. Its crew was also informed that all recent arrivals had been using runway 05 – the longer of the airport's two runways – and there was no braking action data for 14, which was contaminated with wet snow. Shortly before the arrival the updated meteorological data at 12:00 indicated the winds had shifted to a northerly direction, at 15kt with 23kt gusts, which suggests a tailwind component for aircraft landing on runway 14. Communications from the Halifax tower indicate that the crew was uncertain as to where the 737 had come to a halt after the roll-out. The tower controller told one of the ground crews to travel to the threshold of runway 32 – the opposite end of 14 – because the WestJet aircraft “doesn't know if he's stopped by the end of the runway”. “We can't see from the tower,” she added, according to air-ground communications archived by LiveATC. The pilots told the tower that 172 passengers and six crew were on board, but none was injured. Initial inspection of the 737 by attending emergency personnel indicated “minimal”, if any, damage to the jet, the radio communications show. WestJet says the aircraft, operating flight WS248, “experienced an incident” and “departed the end of the runway after landing normally”. It adds that Transportation Safety Board of Canada will be carrying out an investigation, but has released the aircraft. The incident temporarily closed runway 14/32. TSB states that it sent an investigative team to Halifax following the “overrun” of the 737, and will “assess the occurrence”.",1,872,7.0,0.4294,"crew, runway, inquiry, land, approach, accident, investigator, captain, incident, pilot","['canadian', 'investigator', 'open', 'probe', 'overrun', 'halifax', 'stanfield', 'airport', 'westjet', 'arrive', 'toronto', 'january', 'approach', 'waypoint', 'tetar', 'northwest', 'airport', 'told', 'intend', 'arrival', 'runway', 'experience', 'crosswind', 'gusting', 'visual', 'range', 'crew', 'inform', 'recent', 'arrival', 'use', 'runway', 'longer', 'airport', 'runway', 'brake', 'action', 'data', 'contaminate', 'wet', 'snow', 'shortly', 'arrival', 'update', 'meteorological', 'data', 'indicate', 'wind', 'shift', 'northerly', 'direction', 'gust', 'suggests', 'tailwind', 'component', 'land', 'runway', 'communication', 'halifax', 'tower', 'indicate', 'crew', 'uncertain', 'come', 'halt', 'rollout', 'tower', 'controller', 'told', 'ground', 'crew', 'travel', 'threshold', 'runway', 'opposite', 'end', 'westjet', 'know', 'stop', 'end', 'runway', 'ca', 'see', 'tower', 'add', 'accord', 'airground', 'communication', 'archive', 'liveatc', 'pilot', 'told', 'tower', 'passenger', 'crew', 'board', 'none', 'injured', 'initial', 'inspection', 'attend', 'emergency', 'personnel', 'indicate', 'minimal', 'damage', 'jet', 'radio', 'communication', 'westjet', 'say', 'operating', 'experienced', 'incident', 'depart', 'end', 'runway', 'land', 'normally', 'add', 'transportation', 'safety', 'board', 'canada', 'carry', 'investigation', 'release', 'incident', 'temporarily', 'close', 'runway', 'tsb', 'state', 'sent', 'investigative', 'team', 'halifax', 'follow', 'overrun', 'ass', 'occurrence']"
"Indonesia's Citilink appears to have shelved plans for long-haul flights to Europe, pivoting towards Asia instead. Commenting on its first widebody aircraft, an Airbus A330-900neo received from Avolon last month, vice-president for corporate secretary and corporate social responsibility Resty Kusandarina says, “The aircraft is being prepared for [international] expansion and strengthening Citilink's [brand], through the launch of new services to Asia and the Middle East.” Last June, chief executive Juliandra Nurtjahjo told the media that the carrier is expecting to receive two new A330neos between October and December 2019, which will enable it to launch flights into Frankfurt and Jeddah. Then, he explained that the move to launch long-haul flights is part of Citilink's long-term business plan and to align its strategy with parent company, Garuda Indonesia. It is unclear when Citilink will launch long-haul flights and flight tracking websites show the aircraft registered PK-GYC (MSN 1887) is only flying on the Jakarta-Denpasar route. Cirium fleets data shows that Citilink expects to receive a second A330-900neo from Avolon this month. The rest of its in-service fleet comprises of ten A320neos, 41 A320ceos, one 737-500 and six ATR 72-600s.

"Lockheed Martin delivered 134 examples of its F-35 Lightning II stealth fighter in 2019 to the US military services, international development partners and Foreign Military Sales customers. The total was three more than the 131 aircraft it expected to deliver in 2019, the company said on 30 December 2019. The delivery total is an about 47% increase from the year before and 103% increase from 2017. Lockheed Martin is aiming to only slightly increase the number of F-35s it delivers in 2020 to 141 examples. The F-35A conventional-takeoff-and-landing variant is contracted to fall to its lowest price this year at $77.9 million per aircraft. The company plans to continue yearly delivery increases until it hits peak production in 2023 when it aims to delivery more than 170 units. In 2019, deliveries included 81 F-35s for the US military services, 30 for international partner nations in the Joint Strike Fighter programme and 23 for Foreign Military Sales customers, says Lockheed Martin. Lockheed Martin says there are now more than 490 F-35 aircraft operating from 21 bases around the world. Eight countries have F-35s operating from a base on their home soil and eight military services have declared Initial Operating Capability for the aircraft. The Israeli Air Force, US Air Force, US Marine Corps and Royal Air Force have each used the stealth fighter in combat operations.

"Kazakhstan's air navigation service is rejecting the possibility that wake vortices from a preceding departure contributed to the aerodynamic instability of the Bek Air Fokker 100 which crashed at Almaty. Kazaeronavigatsia insists that there was sufficient departure spacing between the Bek Air flight, departing for Nur-Sultan on 27 December, and the aircraft which had taken off immediately before. It says both the Fokker 100 and the preceding aircraft, an Airbus A321, were classified as a medium-sized airframe – a category which includes types with a maximum take-off weight up to 136t. Under Kazakh air traffic control regulations the minimum time interval between departures of medium-sized aircraft is 1min, says Kazaeronavigatsia. But the interval between the A321 and the Bek Air Fokker was around 2min, it insists. “There were no violations of the time intervals during the departures of these aircraft,” it adds. Almaty airport's president indicates that the spacing between the two aircraft was 1min 52s. Preliminary evidence from Bek Air and surveillance video indicates that the aircraft struggled to climb after rotating, experiencing instability during lift-off before striking the ground and veering into structures. “[Take-off] intervals established in [Kazakhstan] comply with global requirements and standards,” says Kazeronavigatsia. “All international airports have similar intervals between take-offs and landings of aircraft.”",1,875,6.0,0.3048,"engine, maintenance, fuel, takeoff, result, failure, system, problem, power, issue","['kazakhstan', 'navigation', 'service', 'reject', 'possibility', 'wake', 'vortex', 'precede', 'departure', 'contribute', 'aerodynamic', 'instability', 'bek', 'fokker', 'crashed', 'almaty', 'kazaeronavigatsia', 'insists', 'sufficient', 'departure', 'space', 'bek', 'depart', 'nursultan', 'december', 'take', 'immediately', 'say', 'fokker', 'precede', 'classify', 'mediumsized', 'airframe', 'category', 'include', 'type', 'maximum', 'takeoff', 'weight', 'kazakh', 'traffic', 'control', 'regulation', 'minimum', 'interval', 'departure', 'mediumsized', 'say', 'kazaeronavigatsia', 'interval', 'bek', 'fokker', 'around', 'insists', 'violation', 'interval', 'departure', 'add', 'almaty', 'airport', 'president', 'indicates', 'space', 'preliminary', 'evidence', 'bek', 'surveillance', 'video', 'indicates', 'struggle', 'climb', 'rotate', 'experience', 'instability', 'liftoff', 'strike', 'ground', 'veer', 'structure', 'takeoff', 'interval', 'establish', 'kazakhstan', 'comply', 'global', 'requirement', 'standard', 'say', 'kazeronavigatsia', 'international', 'airport', 'similar', 'interval', 'takeoff', 'landing']"
"Indonesian Aerospace has rolled out the first prototype of a medium altitude long endurance (MALE) UAV for which it sees a number of domestic missions. The aircraft was unveiled on 30 December 2019 at Indonesian Aerospace's Bandung factory, says the company, also known as PTDI. Dubbed 'Elang Hitam' – Indonesian for Black Eagle – the aircraft has a conventional planform with a V-tail, pusher-propeller, a high aspect ratio, and tricycle landing gear. The aircraft has a wingspan of 16m and a length of 8.65m. The aircraft's payload will be 300kg, and it will be able to land on a 700m runway, or take-off on a 500m runway. It is envisaged as having a maximum endurance of 30h and a cruising speed of 127kt. Two prototypes will be built and used for both flight and structural tests. The company hopes to attain a type certificate from the Ministry of Defence's Feasibility Centre in 2021, and a full military type certificate by 2023, which will include weapons. Indonesian media reports quote company president Elfien Goentoro as saying a first flight is planned in 2020. Media reports that sensor payloads will include a synthetic aperture radar, but the first prototype appears to lack sensors, such as an electro-optical/infrared turret. The aircraft is powered by Rotax engine from Austria. The aircraft can be remotely operated via satellite. Indonesian Aerospace adds that the flight control system is of European origin, coming from Spain. One Indonesian official was quoted as saying that Jakarta has a preference for developing its own UAV to build its technology base, and that foreign suppliers of UAVs “won't give key technologies for free.” The company has been working on the project since 2015. After extensive studies, 2019 saw the commencement of manufacturing work for the two prototypes, including tooling and the production of composite parts in an autoclave.

"Taiwan will probe the fatal crash of a Sikorsky UH-60M helicopter that killed eight, including armed forces leader Gen. Shen Yi-Ming. The crash occurred on the morning of Thursday 2 January in Northern Taiwan, according to the office of Taiwan's president. Contact with the helicopter was lost 13min after it took off from Songshan air base near the capital Taipei, on a flight to an army base in the northeast. Reports suggest the crash occurred in foggy conditions, but investigators have yet to determine if this played a factor in the disaster. Before the crash, however, the crew radioed that weather conditions were acceptable. A rescue force of 80 military personnel was dispatched about an hour after contact was lost. Owing to mountainous terrain it took rescue teams about four hours to reach the survivors. One day after the crash search teams are still looking for the helicopter's flight recorders. A seating chart published in Taiwanese media shows that the five survivors were all seated at the rear of the helicopter.
